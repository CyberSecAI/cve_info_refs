{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `_WM_ParseNewMidi` function in `f_midi.c`. Specifically, when parsing a MIDI file, the code accesses `tracks[i]` without proper bounds checking, leading to an invalid memory read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking",
       "Invalid memory read"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted MIDI file can cause a denial of service, resulting in an application crash due to a segmentation fault.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a crafted MIDI file that triggers the vulnerability during parsing.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the application with the crafted MIDI file."
  }
