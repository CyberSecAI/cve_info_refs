It describes a vulnerability in Docker Registry (docker-distribution) where it does not properly restrict the amount of content accepted from a user. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via memory exhaustion through the manifest endpoint.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper limits on memory allocations when processing content via the manifest endpoint.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Unbounded memory allocation when handling manifests.\n- Lack of content size limits when using `StorageDriver.GetContent`.\n- Unlimited size of manifests uploaded to the registry.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- An attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting the server's memory, impacting availability.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Remote attackers can send specially crafted requests to the manifest endpoint, leading to large memory allocations.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- Remote, unauthenticated attacker is needed to send the crafted requests over the network."

      "content": "The vulnerability was addressed by:\n\n- Implementing a 4MB limit when accessing content via `BlobProvider.Get` by wrapping `StorageDriver.GetContent` in a helper that uses `StorageDriver.Reader` with a `limitReader` which returns an error.\n- Applying similar logic to the request body of payloads that are full buffered.\n- Applying a limit of 4MB to manifest uploads via the `copyFullPayload` function.\n\nThe fix includes modifications to the following files:\n- `registry/handlers/blobupload.go`: Modified `copyFullPayload` calls to include a size limit.\n- `registry/handlers/helpers.go`: Modified the `copyFullPayload` function to accept a limit argument and use `http.MaxBytesReader` to limit payload sizes.\n- `registry/handlers/images.go`: Added a `maxManifestBodySize` constant, and used `copyFullPayload` with that limit when receiving an image manifest.\n- `registry/storage/blobstore.go`: Modified `Get` method to use a helper function `getContent` which implements the size limit.\n- `registry/storage/io.go`: Added `getContent`, `readAllLimited`, and `limitReader` functions to limit the size of the content read.\n\nThese changes introduce mechanisms to restrict memory allocation and prevent unbounded memory usage, thus mitigating the DoS vulnerability."
