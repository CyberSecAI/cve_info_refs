Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-11528:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `ReadDIBImage` function located in the `dib.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The `ReadDIBImage` function fails to properly free allocated memory when processing a crafted DIB file. This results in a memory leak each time a malicious file is processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated processing of a malicious DIB file can lead to memory exhaustion, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DIB File:** The attacker must provide a specifically crafted DIB file to trigger the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to submit or cause the vulnerable ImageMagick application to process the crafted DIB file. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Uploading the malicious file to a web application that uses ImageMagick for processing.
    *   Sending the malicious file as an email attachment to a user who processes it with the vulnerable software.
    *   Directly manipulating a vulnerable system using the crafted file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to affect multiple versions of ImageMagick, including versions within the 6.7.7.10 to 6.9.7.4 range.
*   Patches were made available in ImageMagick versions 6.9.7.4+dfsg-12, 6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u1, and 6.8.9.9-5+deb8u10 to resolve the memory leak.
*   The issue was tracked as #522 on the ImageMagick GitHub repository.
