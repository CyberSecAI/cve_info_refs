Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11592:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an alloc-dealloc-mismatch in the `Exiv2::FileIo::seek` function. This means that memory is allocated using one method (e.g., `malloc`) but deallocated using a different, incompatible method (e.g., `operator delete`). This type of error can corrupt memory and lead to crashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Memory Corruption:** The mismatched allocation and deallocation routines lead to memory corruption, which is a serious vulnerability.
-   **Use-After-Free:** While not explicitly stated, the alloc-dealloc mismatch can lead to use-after-free scenarios where memory is deallocated and then accessed again. This is a typical cause of crashes and exploits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Segmentation Fault/Crash:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a segmentation fault, causing the application to crash, as observed during testing. 
-   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided information mainly indicates a crash, memory corruption vulnerabilities can sometimes be further exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, depending on the application and memory layout.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious File Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted input file (POC9). The crafted file's structure causes the `Exiv2::FileIo::seek` to attempt to free memory in the wrong way.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Provide Input File:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted file to an application using the vulnerable Exiv2 library. This could be through a file upload, file processing, or other means of interaction with the application.

**Technical Details:**
-   The crash occurs within the `Exiv2::FileIo::seek` function.
-   The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output indicates an `alloc-dealloc-mismatch` error on a specific memory address.
-   The call stack shows that the issue occurs when the application tries to process metadata using TIFF structures in a provided image file, eventually calling `Exiv2::FileIo::seek`.
-   The issue was detected using a custom fuzzer.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The provided information gives more detail than the CVE description itself, including the specific function involved and the type of memory error.
-   The vulnerability was reported by the team OWL337 and the issue was forwarded upstream to Exiv2 developers.
-   The issue was fixed in an upstream version and then addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 through an errata.
