Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient validation and missing cross-server-side checks in the Perspective ICM application.
*   The application allows tampering of user permission values loaded through `accessLevels()`, `userEntityPrivs()`, and `userFieldPrivs()` methods within `Perspective.data.dll`. These methods are used to set the user's GUI, permissions, and privilege access to each GUI field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged authenticated user can modify their access level permissions by tampering with values within the application's memory.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The client-side application logic does not have adequate server-side checks to validate the manipulated permission settings.
*   **Client-Side Trust:** The application trusts the client-side data and doesn't re-verify permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Unprivileged users can gain access to privileged actions, hidden fields, and restricted forms (e.g., the "Administration" menu).
*   **Configuration Modification:** Attackers can modify critical application settings (e.g., minimum password length), and potentially impact system integrity.
*   **Data Access:** Unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive information by enabling restricted and non-visible screens.
*   **Report Privilege Modification:** Users can modify their report privileges, which may lead to further access or manipulation.
*   **Global Permission Modification:** Users can modify their global membership permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack requires a user to have a local installation of the client application and the ability to debug the application.
*   **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates permission values directly in memory via a debugger after logging in with a valid unprivileged account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid, although unprivileged, user account to log into the application.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have access to a system where the Perspective ICM application is installed.
*   **Debugging Tools:** The attacker needs a disassembler and debugger tool like "dnspy" to modify the application's memory during runtime.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to use debugging tools and understand the application's logic.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Perspective ICM Investigation & Case version 5.1.1.16.
*   The vulnerability is located within the `Perspective.data.dll`.
*   The attacker can modify `AllowAdd`, `AllowDelete`, `AllowEdit`, `AllowExecute`, `AllowFullControl`, `AllowManage`, `AllowReadOnly`, `AllowShare`, and `Visible` values for specific entities within the application.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes steps for setting breakpoints in `UserEntityPrivs`, `UserFieldPrivs` and `UserReportPrivs` functions of the `DataHandle` class to intercept and modify user permissions and modify values.
