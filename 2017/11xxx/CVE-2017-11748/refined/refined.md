- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Spider Media player application uses an insufficiently qualified path when loading external libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading, also known as DLL hijacking, preloading, or remote binary planting. The application doesn't specify full paths for the DLLs it loads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a required DLL is not found in the expected location or search directories, an attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name in one of those locations, leading to remote code execution when the application attempts to load the DLL.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. A malicious DLL is placed in a directory where the vulnerable application searches for DLLs. Upon launching the application, the malicious DLL is loaded instead of the legitimate one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to write files to a directory that is part of the application's DLL search path. This often involves user-writable directories. The attacker must know the name of the DLLs that the application is trying to load, and also have the possibility to put a malicious DLL with the same name in the search path.
