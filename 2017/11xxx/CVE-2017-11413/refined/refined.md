The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Fiyo CMS. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
The primary root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation for user-supplied data before it's used in SQL queries. The application directly includes POST and GET parameters into SQL statements without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to unfiltered user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries. The use of PDO does not prevent SQL injection because the queries are not parameterized.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system does not sanitize or validate user input from `$_POST` and `$_GET` variables.
- **Use of Stacked Queries:** The application uses PDO which allows the execution of stacked queries, amplifying the impact of SQL injection, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements beyond simply retrieving data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands. This allows them to:
    - Modify data within the database
    - Extract sensitive information
    - Potentially gain control over the system by inserting malicious code or creating new administrative users.
    - Perform denial-of-service attacks by executing resource-intensive queries.
- **Data Breaches:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to, modification of, or deletion of sensitive user and application data.
- **Compromise of the application:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the server due to the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are primarily through:
- HTTP `POST` requests to specific PHP files with malicious values in the parameters
- HTTP `GET` requests to specific PHP files with malicious values in the parameters.

Specific vulnerable locations:
1. `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php`: Vulnerable parameters are `$_POST['id']` and `$_POST['art_title']`.
2. `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php`: Vulnerable parameters are `$_POST['name']`, `$_POST['email']`, `$_POST['url']`, `$_POST['text']`, etc.
3. `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php`: Vulnerable parameters are `$_GET['cat']`, `$_GET['user']`, `$_GET['level']`, and `$_GET['iSortCol*'.$i]`.
4. `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php`: Vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['id']`.
5. `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php`: Vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['id']`.
6. `/dapur/apps/app_article/sys_article.php`: Vulnerable parameters are `$_POST['parent_id']`, `$_POST['desc']`, `$_POST['keys']`, and `$_POST['level']`, as well as others in add and edit functionality.
7. `/dapur/apps/app_comment/controller/comment_status.php`: Vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['id']`.
8. `/dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php`: Vulnerable parameters are `$_POST['comment']`, `$_POST['name']`, `$_POST['web']`, `$_POST['email']`, `$_POST['status']`, `$_POST['id']` and `$_REQUEST['id']`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated in some cases (e.g., `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php`). Some vulnerabilities are accessible to unauthenticated users, and others may require some level of access to the system (e.g., backend admin pages).
- Basic knowledge of SQL syntax is required to craft the injection payloads.
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
