Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-11281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds memory access during the processing of MP4 files within Adobe Flash Player. Specifically, it occurs during "MP4 Edge Processing" or "MP4 parsing."
*   The provided exploit-db entries (42781 and 42782) indicate that a specially crafted MP4 file triggers the out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** One variant of the vulnerability (as described in EDB-ID 42781) involves an out-of-bounds memory *read*.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:**  Another variant (as described in EDB-ID 42782) involves an out-of-bounds memory *write*. This could potentially lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The exploit-db entries both categorize the vulnerability as a "dos" type, suggesting a crash or abnormal termination of Flash Player.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The Red Hat Bugzilla entry and Security Advisory mention that the vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This indicates that successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious MP4 File:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted MP4 file.
*   **Web Browsing:** The vulnerable component is Adobe Flash Player, a browser plugin. Thus, exploitation would likely occur when a user visits a website hosting the malicious MP4 file or opens a local malicious MP4 file through a web page using Flash Player.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting a Malicious MP4 File:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific MP4 file that triggers the out-of-bounds memory access. The provided links to exploit-db contain Proof of Concept files.
*   **Delivery Method:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the crafted MP4 to the victim. This could be through a malicious website, phishing emails with attached files, or by injecting the MP4 into a web page.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to either visit a website or open a web page with the malicious MP4 content and have Adobe Flash Player enabled/installed.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is present in Adobe Flash Player.
* Multiple platforms are affected
* A fix was released by Adobe in version 27.0.0.130, and Red Hat released an update to remediate the vulnerability in their systems using the flash-plugin package.

**Summary of differences in content:**
*   **Exploit-DB:** Provides the most practical details on how to trigger the vulnerability with Proof of Concept files. Differentiates between OOB read and write.
*   **Red Hat:**  Confirms the vulnerability and its potential for RCE, and provides details on the fix and affected products, and a link to a security advisory. Also gives additional information on how they classify vulnerabilities.
*   **Bugzilla:**  Shows internal tracking of the vulnerability and its link to the Red Hat security advisory, and indicates that multiple CVEs were addressed in the same patch.
*   **Gentoo:** Confirms the vulnerability, and provides information on affected versions and a general resolution.
*   **Adobe:** Provides high-level information about discontinued products and does not directly reference the vulnerability or CVE itself.
