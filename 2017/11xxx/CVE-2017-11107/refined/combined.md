# phpLDAPadmin <= 1.2.3 'entry\_chooser.php' Multiple Cross-Site Scripting

|  | [phpldapadmin (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/phpldapadmin "Latest release: 1.2.6.7-2, uploaded to main on 2024-12-31 22:34:23.978107+00:00 by Fabio Tranchitella (kobold), maintained by Fabio Tranchitella (kobold)") | Fix Released | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

$request['form'] and $request['rdn'] parameters in file htdocs/entry\_chooser.php aren't properly sanitized before being echoed to the user, which allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/Javascript code in a user's context.

18 $request['form'] = get\_request('form','GET');

..

20 $request['rdn'] = get\_request('rdn','GET');

..

27 printf(" eval ('o = opener.document.getElementById(\"%s\").%s;');",$request['form'],$request['element']);

..

74 $href['return'] = sprintf("javascript:returnDN('%s%s')",($request['rdn'] ? sprintf('%s,',$request['rdn']) : ''),str\_replace('\\','\\\\',$dn));

This vulnerability, if successfully exploited, can lead to data manipulation or information leakage as it is demonstrated in the PoC video.

Hello Ismail, thanks for taking on this task.

There's a few small things that I'd like changed before we sponsor this:

- Since Ubuntu doesn't really have package 'maintainers', there's no need to point out it's a non-maintainer upload

- We like the security updates to all have consistent formatting as described on: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation#Update_the_packaging>

- We like the patches to have DEP-3 tags to indicate at least where the patch came from, so future readers can verify patches independently. (While DEP-3 is kind of complicated and involved, it's basically just adding Subject: with something short and descriptive and Origin: with a link to the patch.) The full DEP-3 guide is at <http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/> but don't feel compelled to read it unless I did a poor job describing it here.

Could you submit a new patch with these items fixed up?

Thanks

Hello, Ismail Belkacim reported [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/phpldapadmin/+bug/1701731](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/phpldapadmin/%2Bbug/1701731) to Ubuntu's bug tracker. He also provided a patch, <https://launchpadlibrarian.net/327292294/phpldapadmin_1.2.2-5.2ubuntu2.1_updated.debdiff> -- is this an already known issue? Do you know if CVE has already been assigned to this issue? I didn't see fixes like his in the git tree here.

Thanks

The important part of the patch:

Package        : phpldapadmin
Version        : 1.2.2-5.2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11107
Debian Bug     : 867719

It was discovered that there was a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
phpldapadmin, a web-based interface for administering LDAP servers.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.2.2-5.2+deb8u1.

Note: the package changelog mistakenly refers to the non-existent
CVE-2016-11107 identifier. The proper identifier to refer to this issue
is CVE-2017-11107.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
