Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `entry_chooser.php` file in phpLDAPadmin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before echoing it back to the user. Specifically, the `$request['form']`, `$request['element']`, and `$request['rdn']` parameters received via GET requests are not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the user's browser, in the context of the vulnerable web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data manipulation: The injected script could be used to alter data displayed by the application.
- Information leakage: An attacker could use the injected script to steal sensitive information such as session cookies or other data displayed in the page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious GET requests to the `entry_chooser.php` script, injecting the malicious code into the `form`, `element`, or `rdn` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable phpLDAPadmin server.
- No specific user privileges are required, as the XSS is reflected and does not require stored data on the server side to be exploitable.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in phpLDAPadmin versions from 1.1.0 to 1.2.3.
- The fix involves sanitizing the affected parameters using `htmlspecialchars(addslashes())` before they are used in the output.
- The issue is tracked in the Ubuntu bug tracker as [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/phpldapadmin/+bug/1701731](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/phpldapadmin/%2Bbug/1701731), Debian bug tracker as [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=867719](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=867719) , and also on GitHub as [https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/issues/50](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/issues/50)
- A patch was created and applied to fix this vulnerability.
