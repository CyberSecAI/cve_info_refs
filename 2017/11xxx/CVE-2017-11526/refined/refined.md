{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ReadOneMNGImage` function in ImageMagick reads a chunk length from the MNG file, and then attempts to read that many bytes from the input file. The length is read as a 32-bit integer without validation and used in a loop. By providing a large chunk length in a crafted MNG file, an attacker can cause a CPU exhaustion vulnerability because of the extensive I/O operation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unvalidated size in loop",
    "CPU exhaustion"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "CPU exhaustion, leading to denial of service",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted MNG image file",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a specially crafted MNG image file to ImageMagick for processing."
