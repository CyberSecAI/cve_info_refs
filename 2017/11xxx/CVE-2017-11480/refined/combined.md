**Packetbeat denial of service (ESA-2017-21)**

Packetbeat versions prior to 5.6.4 are affected by a denial of service flaw in the PostgreSQL protocol handler. If Packetbeat is listening for PostgreSQL traffic and a user is able to send arbitrary network traffic to the monitored port, the attacker could prevent Packetbeat from properly logging other PostgreSQL traffic.

**Affected Versions:** All prior to 5.6.4

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Packetbeat version 5.6.4. This issue can be avoided by disabling the PostgreSQL protocol.

**Credit:** Thanks to Teppei Fukuda for reporting this issue.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11480
