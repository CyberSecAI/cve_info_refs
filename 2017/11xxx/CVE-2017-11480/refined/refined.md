- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the PostgreSQL protocol handler within Packetbeat.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Denial of service vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can prevent Packetbeat from properly logging other PostgreSQL traffic.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending arbitrary network traffic to the monitored port that Packetbeat is listening on for PostgreSQL traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the port monitored by Packetbeat for PostgreSQL traffic.
