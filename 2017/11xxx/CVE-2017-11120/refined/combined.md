# Apple iOS 10.2 - Broadcom Out-of-Bounds Write when Handling 802.11k Neighbor Report Response

#### EDB-ID:

###### 42784

#### CVE:

###### [2017-11120](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11120)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [remote](/?type=remote)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1289

The exploit gains code execution on the Wi-Fi firmware on the iPhone 7.

The exploit has been tested against the Wi-Fi firmware as present on iOS 10.2 (14C92), but should work on all versions of iOS up to 10.3.3 (included). However, some symbols might need to be adjusted for different versions of iOS, see "exploit/symbols.py" for more information.

Upon successful execution of the exploit, a backdoor is inserted into the firmware, allowing remote read/write commands to be issued to the firmware via crafted action frames (thus allowing easy remote control over the Wi-Fi chip).

The attached archive contains the following directories:
  -hostapd-2.6 - A modified version of hostapd utilised in the exploit. This version of hostapd is configured to
                 support 802.11k RRM, and in particular Neighbor Reports. Moreover, this version of hostapd is
                 instrumented to add various commands, allowing injection and reception of crafted action frames
                 used throughout the exploit.
  -exploit     - The exploit itself.

To run the exploit, you must execute the following steps:
  -Connect (and enable) a SoftMAC Wi-Fi dongle to your machine (such as the TL-WN722N)
  -Compile the provided version of hostapd
  -Modify the "interface" setting under "hostapd-2.6/hostapd/hostapd.conf" to match your interface's name
  -Configure the following settings under "exploit/conf.py":
    -HOSTAPD_DIR - The directory of the hostapd binary compiled above
    -TARGET_MAC  - The MAC address of the device being exploited
    -AP_MAC      - The MAC address of your wireless dongle
    -INTERFACE   - The name of the wireless dongle's interface
  -Assemble the backdoor shellcode by running "exploit/assemble_backdoor.sh"
  -Run hostapd with the configuration file provided above, broadcasting a Wi-Fi network ("test80211k")
  -Connect the target device to the network
  -Run "exploit/attack.py"

Following the steps above should result in installation of a simple backdoor allowing read/write access to the firmware. You can interact with the backdoor to gain R/W access to the firmware by calling the "read_dword" and "write_dword" functions, respectively.

that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Android Security Bulletin—September 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published September 5, 2017 | Updated October 5, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of September 05, 2017 or later
address all of these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin at least a month
ago. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the Android Open
Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin
also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical severity vulnerability in media
framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to
execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google Play Protect mitigations](#mitigations) section
for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and Google Play Protect, which improve the
security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air update (OTA) and
firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[Google device updates](#google-device-updates) section.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common questions and answers](#questions) for additional information:
  + **2017-09-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-09-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-09-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-09-01
    and 2017-09-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are
    addressed.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as
[Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect). These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through [Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect) and warns
  users about [Potentially Harmful Applications](https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect/potentially-harmful-applications). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is
  especially important for users who install apps from outside of Google
  Play.

## 2017-09-01 security patch level—Vulnerability details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2017-09-01 patch level. Vulnerabilities are
grouped under the component that they affect. There is a description of the
issue and a table with the CVE, associated references,
[type of vulnerability](#type),
[severity](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity),
and updated AOSP versions (where applicable). When available, we link the public
change that addressed the issue to the bug ID, like the AOSP change list. When
multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional references are linked to
numbers following the bug ID.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-09-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-09-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-09-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-09-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-09-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-09-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2017-09-01 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
  reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2017-09-05 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).
