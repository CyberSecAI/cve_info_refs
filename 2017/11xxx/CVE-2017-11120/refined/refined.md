{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A memory corruption issue was present in the Wi-Fi chip handling of 802.11k Neighbor Report responses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered via specially crafted 802.11k Neighbor Report responses."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the target device and be able to broadcast malicious 802.11k Neighbor Report responses. Exploitation allows for code execution on the Wi-Fi chip which may be used to gain arbitrary code execution on the application processor."
