The provided content describes an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in ZenCart 1.5.5e.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of request parameters when saving admin activity logs. Specifically, the application sanitizes request *values* using `htmlspecialchars`, but not the request *keys*. This allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP code within the request key, which is then saved to a log file. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the system uses `print_r` to serialize the POST data to the log files and the second sanitization using `htmlspecialchars` can be bypassed by saving the logs in CSV format instead of HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of request keys.
- Insecure logging of unsanitized POST data.
- Inability to sanitize the content if CSV format is chosen.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) on the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code by injecting it into a log file and then accessing it through the web browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted login request with PHP code embedded in the key of POST parameters.
- The attacker must then log in as admin and save a log file as CSV.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `admin_dir/login.php` page with the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs administrative privileges to export the logs as a CSV file to the backups directory.
