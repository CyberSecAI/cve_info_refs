## Topic

An update for rh-nodejs6-nodejs is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Node.js is a software development platform for building fast and scalable network applications in the JavaScript programming language.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-nodejs6-nodejs (6.11.3). (BZ#1476317)

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that Node.js was using a non-randomized seed when populating hash tables. An attacker, able to supply a large number of inputs, could send specially crafted entries to the Node.js application, maximizing hash collisions to trigger an excessive amount of CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-11499)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

# Security updates for all active release lines, July 2017

[![Michael Dawson](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars.githubusercontent.com%2Fmhdawson&w=96&q=75)](https://github.com/mhdawson)

Security updates for all active release lines, July 2017
# [*(Update 10-August-2017)* Snapshots Re-enabled on 8.3.0](#update-10-august-2017-snapshots-re-enabled-on-830)

The vulnerability has been patched upstream and snapshots have been re-enabled in 8.3.0

Expect a backport and update with the next release of 6.x

**Download**

* [Node.js v8 (Current)](/en/blog/release/v8.3.0)

## [*(Update 11-July-2017)* Security releases available](#update-11-july-2017-security-releases-available)

## [Summary](#summary)

Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines as well as the 7.x line. These include the fix for the high severity vulnerability identified in the initial announcement, one additional lower priority Node.js vulnerability in the 4.x release line, as well as some lower priority fixes for Node.js dependencies across the current release lines.

We recommend that users of all these release lines upgrade as soon as possible.

**Downloads**

* [Node.js v8 (Current)](/en/blog/release/v8.1.4)
* [Node.js v7](/en/blog/release/v7.10.1)
* [Node.js v6 (LTS "Boron")](/en/blog/release/v6.11.1)
* [Node.js v4 (LTS "Argon")](/en/blog/release/v4.8.4)

**Note:** The 0.10.x and 0.12.x release lines are also vulnerable to the **Constant Hashtable Seeds** vulnerability. We recommend that users of these release lines upgrade to one of the supported LTS release lines.

## [Node.js-specific security flaws](#nodejs-specific-security-flaws)

**Constant Hashtable Seeds (CVE-2017-11499)**

Node.js was susceptible to hash flooding remote DoS attacks as the HashTable seed was constant across a given released version of Node.js. This was a result of building with V8 snapshots enabled by default which caused the initially randomized seed to be overwritten on startup. Thanks to Jann Horn of Google Project Zero for reporting this vulnerability.

You can read about the general category of hash flooding vulnerabilities here: <https://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007_28C3_Effective_DoS_on_web_application_platforms.pdf>.

Snapshots have been disabled by default in these updates. Code that relies heavily on `vm.runInNewContext` will most likely see a performance regression until a better solution is implemented.

This is a high severity vulnerability and applies to all active release lines (4.x, 6.x, 8.x) as well as the 7.x line.

**http.get with numeric authorization options creates uninitialized buffers**

Application code that allows the auth field of the options object used with http.get() to be set to a number can result in an uninitialized buffer being created/used as the authentication string. For example:

```
const opts = require('url').parse('http://127.0.0.1:8180');
opts.auth = 1e3; // A number here triggers the bug
require('http').get(opts, res => res.pipe(process.stdout));

```

Parsing of the auth field has been updated in the 4.x release so that a TypeError will be thrown if the auth field is a number when http.get() is called.

This is a low severity defect and only applies to the 4.x release line.

## [Vulnerabilities in dependencies](#vulnerabilities-in-dependencies)

The releases for the affected Node.js release lines have been updated to include the patches need to address the following issues in Node.js dependencies. These are all considered to be low severity for Node.js due to the limited impact or likelihood of exploit in the Node.js environment.

**CVE-2017-1000381 - c-ares NAPTR parser out of bounds access**

A security vulnerability has been discovered in the c-ares library that is bundled with all versions of Node.js. Parsing of NAPTR responses could be triggered to read memory outside of the given input buffer through carefully crafted DNS response packets. The patch recommended in [CVE-2017-1000381](https://c-ares.haxx.se/adv_20170620.html) has been added to the version of c-ares in Node.js in these releases.

This is a low severity defect and affects all active release lines (4.x, 6.x and 8.x) as well as the 7.x line.

***Original post is included below***

---

## [Summary](#summary-1)

The Node.js project will be releasing new versions across all of its active release lines (4.x, 6.x, 8.x) as well as 7.x the week of July 10th 2017 to incorporate a security fix.

## [Denial of Service Vulnerability](#denial-of-service-vulnerability)

All current versions of v4.x through to v8.x inclusive are vulnerable to an issue that can be used by an external attacker to cause a denial of service. The severity of this vulnerability is high and users of the affected versions should plan to upgrade when a fix is made available.

## [Impact](#impact)

* Versions 4.x of Node.js **are vulnerable**
* Versions 6.x of Node.js **are vulnerable**
* Versions 7.x of Node.js **are vulnerable**
* Versions 8.x of Node.js **are vulnerable**

## [Release timing](#release-timing)

Releases will be available at, or shortly after, Tuesday the 11th of July along with disclosure of the details for the vulnerability in order to allow for complete impact assessment by users.

## Synopsis

Moderate: rh-nodejs4-nodejs security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A3002)

## Topic

An update for rh-nodejs4, rh-nodejs4-node-gyp, and rh-nodejs4-nodejs is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-nodejs4-nodejs (4.8.4). (BZ#1476314)

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that Node.js was using a non-randomized seed when populating hash tables. An attacker, able to supply a large number of inputs, could send specially crafted entries to the Node.js application, maximizing hash collisions to trigger an excessive amount of CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-11499)

Bug Fix(es):

* The /opt/rh/rh-nodejs4/root/usr/share/licenses/ directory was not owned by any package. Consequently, when the rh-nodejs4 collection was uninstalled, the directory was not removed. This bug has been fixed, and the aforementioned directory is correctly removed after uninstalling rh-nodejs4. (BZ#1316626)

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1475327#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-26 12:51:34 UTC  ``` Node.js v4.0 through v4.8.3, all versions of v5.x, v6.0 through v6.11.0, v7.0 through v7.10.0, and v8.0 through v8.1.3 was susceptible to hash flooding remote DoS attacks as the HashTable seed was constant across a given released version of Node.js. This was a result of building with V8 snapshots enabled by default which caused the initially randomized seed to be overwritten on startup.  External References:  <https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2017-security-releases/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1475327#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-26 12:52:26 UTC  ``` Created nodejs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1475330](show_bug.cgi?id=1475330 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-11499 nodejs: Constant Hashtable Seeds vulnerability [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1475328](show_bug.cgi?id=1475328 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2017-11499 nodejs: Constant Hashtable Seeds vulnerability [fedora-all]")] Affects: openshift-1 [[bug 1475329](show_bug.cgi?id=1475329)]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1475327#c3)  Cedric Buissart    2017-07-28 09:45:48 UTC  ``` Lowering severity to Medium to keep it aligned with similar remote DoS by hash table issues.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1475327#c9)  Cedric Buissart    2017-08-01 13:24:36 UTC  ``` The upstream fix pointed in the upstream release note (commit 51d69d2bec) was a temporary fix only, aimed at disabling snapshot by default, and had a negative performance impact during creation of contexts (e.g.: vm.runInNewContext() calls).  A later patch re-enables snapshot by default, and adds re-hashing after de-serialization as mitigation : <https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/8dce05fa>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1475327#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-18 07:51:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 EUS  Via RHSA-2017:2908 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2908](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2908)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1475327#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-23 09:20:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 EUS  Via RHSA-2017:3002 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3002](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3002)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1475327#c12)  Jason Shepherd    2018-04-03 06:23:41 UTC  ``` Openshift Enterprise uses latest RHSCL nodejs-4-rhel7 image which contains a fix for this issue.
