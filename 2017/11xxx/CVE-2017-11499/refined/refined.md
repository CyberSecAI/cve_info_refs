  "CVE-2017-11499": {
    "description": "It was found that Node.js was using a non-randomized seed when populating hash tables. An attacker, able to supply a large number of inputs, could send specially crafted entries to the Node.js application, maximizing hash collisions to trigger an excessive amount of CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service.",
