The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS before v5.0.9, but **does not include information on CVE-2017-11629.**

The following vulnerabilities are detailed:
*   **URL Redirector Abuse:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `sync` function in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/Weixin.php` redirects to any URL without validation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of URL validation.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By crafting a specific URL with the `url` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a user to visit the crafted URL.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `username` parameter in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/admin/Login.php` is not properly sanitized when login fails, leading to XSS.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By providing malicious input to the username field.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the victim to attempt logging into the admin panel.
*   **api.php Reflected XSS:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `function` parameter in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/api.php`'s `data2` function is not sanitized and is output directly onto the page.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation, sanitization, and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's browser.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By providing malicious input to the `function` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the victim to visit the crafted URL.
*   **SQL Injection in `action=related` `catid` Parameter:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `catid` parameter in the `list_tag` function (Template.php) is not sanitized and is directly used in SQL queries when `action=related`.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation for the catid parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to perform SQL injection, potentially leading to database compromise.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By crafting a specific URL with malicious SQL code in the `catid` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to obtain the `SYS_KEY` and craft an authenticated request.
*   **SQL Injection via `$system[num]` Parameter:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `$system['num']` parameter in the `list_tag` function is not sanitized when `action=tags` or `action=related`, allowing SQL injection through the `analyse()` function (MySQL 5.0.0 < version < 5.6.6).
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to perform SQL injection, potentially leading to database compromise.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By crafting a specific URL with a malicious SQL code within the `num` parameter.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to obtain the `SYS_KEY` and craft an authenticated request.
*   **SQL Injection via `$system[field]` Parameter:**
    *  **Root Cause:** The `$system['field']` parameter is not sanitized in the `list_tag` function when `action=related`, `action=form`, `action=member`, and `action=module`, allowing SQL injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to perform SQL injection, potentially leading to database compromise.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By crafting a specific URL with malicious SQL code in the `field` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to obtain the `SYS_KEY` and craft an authenticated request.
*  **Remote PHP Code Execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `action=cache` parameter bypasses some filters, allowing the `$_param` parameter to be used within `eval()`, enabling arbitrary PHP execution.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input validation and use of `eval()`.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a specific URL with malicious PHP code in the `name` parameter.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to obtain the `SYS_KEY` and craft an authenticated request.
