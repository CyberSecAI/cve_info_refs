Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Bolt CMS 3.2.14:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **XSS through SVG File Upload:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The CMS allows uploading SVG files without properly checking their content. It relies on the "Content-Type: image/svg+xml" header and fails to recognize that the uploaded SVG file contains JavaScript code.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate content validation for uploaded SVG files. The system trusts the content-type header and does not analyze file contents for malicious payloads.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing JavaScript code.
2.  **Stored XSS:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The CMS does not properly validate or sanitize user input.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization. This allows an attacker to insert and store malicious JavaScript code permanently.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Inserting malicious JavaScript into a field that is later displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS through SVG File Upload:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the uploaded SVG file is accessed.
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript code persistently on the website, which will be executed when a user views the affected part of the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication**: Both vulnerabilities require the attacker to be authenticated, implying the attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the CMS.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vendor has not accepted these vulnerabilities according to the blog post.
* The blog post includes links to POC videos demonstrating both vulnerabilities.
