Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The DOCSIS dissector in Wireshark has a flaw that can cause it to enter an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Infinite Loop:** A malformed DOCSIS packet can trigger an infinite loop within the dissector. This is due to a lack of proper handling of certain packet structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Excessive CPU Consumption:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition on the system running Wireshark.
*   **Program Unresponsiveness:** The infinite loop will make Wireshark unresponsive, hindering its ability to capture and analyze network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Network Packets:** Injecting a specially crafted malformed DOCSIS packet onto the network.
*   **Malicious Packet Trace Files:**  Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file containing the crafted DOCSIS packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to inject packets onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
*   **Social Engineering:** If the attack involves a malicious trace file, the attacker needs to convince the victim to open the file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.7 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.13.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark versions 2.2.8 and 2.0.14.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2017-11406 and Wireshark issue 13797.
