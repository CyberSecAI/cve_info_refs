- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the library disabling code in Factorio allows access to `package.loaders` and `package.cpath` within the Lua scripting environment, despite attempts to restrict access to sensitive libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Exposure of `package.loaders` and `package.cpath` in the Lua sandbox.
    - Ability to modify `package.cpath` to point to arbitrary locations.
    - Ability to load and execute arbitrary C code via a specially crafted library.
    - Ability to write files to the file system via the `LuaGameScript::write_file` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote code execution (RCE) on the server and/or client machines, leading to arbitrary code execution by loading and executing C libraries.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malicious mod author providing a malicious mod.
    - Malicious user with elevated privileges in multiplayer server.
    - Malicious server owner hosting a malicious scenario.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to craft Lua scripts, C libraries, and use the game API.
    - Either have elevated privileges within a multiplayer game, be a server owner, or be able to convince users to install a malicious mod.
