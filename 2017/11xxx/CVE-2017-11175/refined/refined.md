Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way the J2 Innovations FIN Stack 4.0 application handles user input in the login page URL's query string. The application does not properly sanitize or encode the query parameters before reflecting them back in the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the query string of the `/login` URL. This script is then reflected back and executed in the victim's browser, within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they visit the crafted link.
*   **Potential for Information Theft:** An attacker can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
*   **Defacement and Redirects:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site or deface the login page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is the manipulation of the URL pointing to the login page (`/login`).
*   **Specifically, the query string in the /login URL:** Appending malicious JavaScript code within the query string allows for execution within the login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without any prior authentication to the application.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker only needs the ability to craft and deliver a malicious URL. This can be done via various means such as phishing emails or malicious links on external websites.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability using the following URL structure:
    `http://example.com/login?a%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27MIR%20XSS%20Test%27%29%3C/script%3Ea=1`
*   The `%22` encodes a double quote (`"`), and the `<script>alert('MIR XSS Test')</script>` tag represents the malicious JavaScript payload.
*   When a user visits the crafted URL, the browser renders the HTML, and as a result, executes the JavaScript code, displaying an alert message.

**Timeline:**

*   **2017-07-05:** Vendor was informed of the vulnerability.
*   **2017-07-11:** Request for a CVE number was submitted to Mitre.
*   **2017-07-12:** CVE-2017-11175 was assigned.
*   **2017-08-25:** Vendor indicated that a fix would take a month or two.
