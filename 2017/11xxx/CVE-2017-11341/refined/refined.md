```
Root cause of vulnerability: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the libsass library, specifically within the `exactly()` function located at `src/lexer.hpp:92`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow in the `exactly()` function. This function performs a single character literal match, and the vulnerability occurs when the input string is crafted to cause a read beyond the allocated buffer.

Impact of exploitation: A successful exploit can cause a crash (as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer output) due to the out-of-bounds read. This crash could potentially be leveraged for more severe impacts such as arbitrary code execution, but this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided information.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file (POC1) via the `sassc` command-line tool.  The specific input that triggers the bug is a string starting with `'~\\`, but the provided report shows that the vulnerability exists when parsing single quoted strings.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to be able to provide a malicious input file to the `sassc` utility.
