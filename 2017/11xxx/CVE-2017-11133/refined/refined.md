```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The communication channel encryption keys (for AES in CBC mode) and initialization vectors (IVs), which are exchanged using RSA key pairs, are generated using `math.random()`. This method is not cryptographically secure and produces deterministic outputs, potentially compromising the communication channel.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Usage of a weak PRNG for generating cryptographic keys and IVs
- Deterministic nature of `math.random()` leads to predictability of the encryption parameters

Impact of exploitation:
Compromise of the communication channel by predicting encryption keys and IVs used by the application to encrypt messages. This can lead to decryption of the messages exchanged between the users.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker would need to observe or intercept the keys and IVs exchanged between the clients

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to intercept network traffic
- Knowledge of the weakness
