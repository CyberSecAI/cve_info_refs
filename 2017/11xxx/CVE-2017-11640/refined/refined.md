Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11640:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple memory handling issues and inadequate input sanitization within ImageMagick. Specifically, the github issue #584, which seems to be related, points to an "Address Access Except in WritePTIFImage() coders/tiff.c". A crash report is included in the description that points to an error in `CopyMagickString` which is called by `WritePTIFImage`. The root cause is likely an attempt to copy a string to an invalid memory location within the `WritePTIFImage` function in `coders/tiff.c`.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The `CopyMagickString` function attempts to copy a string to a memory location derived from user-controlled input.  If the destination is invalid then a crash occurs. This suggests a classic buffer overflow or out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted file. This implies that ImageMagick does not properly validate the input, allowing the malformed file to cause memory corruption.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact mentioned across all sources is a denial of service, which is triggered by the crash in the `WritePTIFImage` function. The ASAN crash log provided shows a SEGV signal.
*   **Possible Code Execution:** Several sources also mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution. The memory corruption could potentially allow attackers to overwrite critical data and manipulate program flow. The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4040-1 explicitly mentions the possibility of "the execution of arbitrary code". However, there is no concrete information regarding code execution in the provided content.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions the possibility of leaking sensitive information, however there's no detail as to how this would occur.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted File:** The attack vector involves enticing a user or automated system to process a malformed image file. The GitHub issue #584 provides a link to a proof-of-concept file (`SEGV_output_ptif_WritePTIFImage`) which triggers the crash in `WritePTIFImage`

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is described as remotely exploitable, implying an attacker does not need direct access to the system.
*   **File Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver the crafted image file to a target system running a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could be through a website, email attachment, or other means.

**Summary of relevant information:**

| CVE                                  | Root Cause                                                                | Weakness                   | Impact                                                  | Attack Vector                       | Required Attacker Capabilities |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| CVE-2017-11640                     | Memory corruption in `WritePTIFImage` due to invalid string copy       | Out-of-bounds write, insufficient input sanitization | Denial of Service, possibly code execution or info leak | Malformed image file       | Remote                             |

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information, especially the GitHub issue #584, gives more details on the specific vulnerability than the general CVE description.
*   Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability impacts ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.9.20.
*   The vulnerability is also addressed in various Linux distributions' security updates.

In summary, CVE-2017-11640 involves memory corruption within ImageMagick triggered by processing specially crafted image files, potentially leading to denial of service, code execution, and information disclosure. The attack vector is remote, requiring the attacker to deliver a malformed file to the vulnerable system.
