Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-11209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the ImageConversion's XPS parsing functionality in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. The software doesn't properly validate user-supplied data during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The lack of proper input validation allows a read operation to access memory beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the application's memory.
- Potential for further exploitation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be leveraged in combination with other vulnerabilities to potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers.
- User interaction required: Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically the user needs to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file that triggers the flawed XPS parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XPS file or control a web page that triggers the vulnerable XPS parsing within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- No specific authentication is mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication to the application.
