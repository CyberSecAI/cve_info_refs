Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-11152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `PixlrEditorHandler.php` file within Synology Photo Station. Specifically, the `path` parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the `path` parameter in `PixlrEditorHandler.php`. This allows an attacker to specify file paths outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker can write arbitrary files to the system. This can be used to overwrite existing files or write new files such as malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `PixlrEditorHandler.php` with a malicious `path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Synology Photo Station server.
*  **No Authentication Needed:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication as part of an exploit chain with other vulnerabilities in the advisory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit code provided in the first document demonstrates how this vulnerability is used as part of a larger exploit chain which utilizes CVE-2017-11151 to upload a fake session file and then uses CVE-2017-11153 to gain admin privileges, after which this vulnerability can be used to write a php webshell.

*  This vulnerability is used to write an arbitrary file after the attacker has authenticated as an admin, which is achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities in the chain.
