Package        : vim
Version        : 2:7.4.488-7+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11109 CVE-2017-17087 CVE-2019-12735
Debian Bug     : 867720 930020

Several minor issues have been fixed in vim, a highly configurable
text editor.

CVE-2017-11109

    Vim allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free)
    or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted source
    (aka -S) file.

CVE-2017-17087

    Vim sets the group ownership of a .swp file to the editor's
    primary group (which may be different from the group ownership of
    the original file), which allows local users to obtain sensitive
    information by leveraging an applicable group membership.

CVE-2019-12735

    Vim did not restrict the `:source!` command when executed in a
    sandbox.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2:7.4.488-7+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
