- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ReadTGAImage` function within the `coders\tga.c` file of ImageMagick. The `bits_per_pixel` value read directly from the TGA image file is used to calculate the number of colors `image->colors` without proper validation, which can lead to excessive memory allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication `one << tga_info.bits_per_pixel` can cause an integer overflow, where the size of the allocated memory is larger than expected.
    - **Unvalidated Input:** The `bits_per_pixel` and `image_type` values are read directly from the TGA file without proper validation, allowing an attacker to control these values.
    - **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The code allocates memory based on the attacker-controlled values before security checks, making the memory allocation stage vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By crafting a malicious TGA image with a large `bits_per_pixel` and a specific `image_type`, an attacker can cause ImageMagick to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition via memory exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TGA image file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to provide the vulnerable ImageMagick installation with a crafted TGA file as input.
