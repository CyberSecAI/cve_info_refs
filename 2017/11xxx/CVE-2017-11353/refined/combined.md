## Description

[![@TheLocehiliosan](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1503609?u=49936b1004232c77385f5bbedc71117b0354fa44&v=4&size=48)](/TheLocehiliosan)[TheLocehiliosan](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan)opened [on Jul 14, 2017](https://github.com/yadm-dev/yadm/issues/74#issue-243045834)

As referenced in [Debian #868300](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=868300), permissions on `.ssh` and `.gnupg` directories are restricted *after* an initial clone is complete. Git employs the user's umask to set permissions for any files/directories created.

If `.ssh` or `.gnupg` directories already exist with restricted permissions prior to cloning, the permissions will not be changed. Git only affects the permissions of directories that do not already exist. In practice this race condition does not pose a problem assuming the encryption feature is used for confidential data.

For example, suppose a user wants to manage a `.ssh/config` and `.ssh/id_rsa`. Also suppose the `.ssh/config` is limited configuration data only, and the `.ssh/id_rsa` is their private key. If `.ssh/id_rsa` is included using the encryption function the following scenarios are possible:

* If `.ssh` already exists and is secured

  + During the clone `.ssh` permissions are not changed (remain secure)
* If `.ssh` does not yet exist

  + During the clone `.ssh` and `.ssh/config` will be created with the default umask
  + (at this point no private data is exposed)
  + After the clone permissions are restricted
  + `yadm decrypt` is run (either by the user or via bootstrap) and the `.ssh/id_rsa` is put into the `.ssh`. `.ssh`'s permissions will already be restricted at this point

Regardless, I plan to update clone operations. If there are files tracked in the repo under locations `.ssh` or `.gnupg` and those paths do not yet exist (an initial clone), I will create empty directories and secure them first. This should mitigate any concerns about a race condition. However, I don't think there is any effective problem as it stands today.

Subject: yadm: race condition allows access to ssh and pgp keys
Date: Fri, 14 Jul 2017 10:33:09 +0000
```
Package: yadm
Version: 1.10.0-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security upstream
Justification: user security hole

Dear Maintainer,

In its default configuration, yadm ensures that .ssh/ and .gnupg/ files are
readable by the owner only.  That is implemented by running 'chmod' on the
files after they have been created:

    <https://sources.debian.net/src/yadm/1.10.0-1/yadm/#L671>

That way has a race condition: whilst the git worktree is being checked out,
the .ssh and .gnupg files have the permissions of the user's umask.  I added a
debug printf just before the 'chmod' and it showed .ssh/ and .ssh/config having
permissions «u=rwX,go=rX», i.e., world readable.

I tested in an uptodate sid chroot.

(I'm leaving the severity as 'grave' since I figure the vulnerability window
may be long in setups where the tree being checked out is large.)

Cheers,

Daniel

```

[CVE-2017-11353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11353) has been assigned by MITRE for this issue (can you pass
please this information to upstream and possibly have it included in
the upstream changelog and commit once fixed).
