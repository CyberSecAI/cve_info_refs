{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of proper input sanitization and validation in multiple PHP files within the FiyoCMS application. Specifically, user-supplied data from $_POST and $_GET parameters are directly incorporated into SQL queries without any filtering or escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of input sanitization. The application uses PDO for database interaction, which, while capable of preventing SQL injection when used correctly, is vulnerable due to direct inclusion of unsanitized input into the SQL queries. The use of stack queries can allow for execution of arbitrary SQL commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could potentially lead to: \n- Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive data).\n- Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).\n- Privilege escalation (potentially gaining administrative access).\n- Complete compromise of the database and underlying system.\n- In some specific cases, the attacker uses `sleep()` function to create a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be exploited through HTTP POST and GET requests by injecting malicious SQL code into the following parameters:\n- `$_POST['id']` and `$_POST['art_title']` in `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php`\n- `$_POST['name']`, `$_POST['email']`, `$_POST['url']`, and `$_POST['text']` in `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php`\n- `$_GET['cat']`, `$_GET['user']`, `$_GET['level']`, and `$_GET['iSortCol*'.$i]` in `dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php`\n- `$_GET['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php`\n- `$_GET['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php`\n- `$_POST['parent_id']`, `$_POST['desc']`, `$_POST['keys']`, and `$_POST['level']` in `/dapur/apps/app_article/sys_article.php`\n- `$_GET['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_comment/controller/comment_status.php`\n- `$_POST['comment']`, `$_POST['name']`, `$_POST['web']`, `$_POST['email']`, `$_POST['status']`, `$_POST['id']`, and `$_REQUEST['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php`",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the specified parameters to inject malicious SQL code.  No special privileges or specific locations within the application are mentioned, meaning the attack is generally applicable to users interacting with these endpoints."
