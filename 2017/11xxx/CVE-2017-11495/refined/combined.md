Vulnerability description-------------------------PHICOMM is an information communication domain equipment and service providers, products cover more than 70 countries. We find a RCE vulnerability in one of its router product after connecting to it. Details are as follows:There is a URL which anyone can access without credentials in an ajax function when you are able to access the router's WiFi.And then our automated vulnerability detection tool discovered a remote code execution in this url handling function in lighthttpd.
POC: curl 'http://ip:port/\*\*\*\*\*.asp?action=set&MAC=1&IP=;&DeviceRename=1&isBind=1&ifType=reboot&BlockUser=-f;&UpMax=0&DownMax=0'
This poc can reboot the router, resulting in a Dos. p.s.Given the vendor's security, we only provide parts of the URL.
