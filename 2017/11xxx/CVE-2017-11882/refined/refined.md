The overflow is caused due to a missing bounds check when handling the font name.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n* Stack-based buffer overflow.\n*   Lack of ASLR and DEP on the Equation Editor process making it easier to exploit.\n*   Equation Editor is an out-of-process COM server.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.\n*   The stack overflow allows an attacker to control the return address and hijack program flow.\n*   Can be used to run arbitrary commands using WinExec.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   A specially crafted RTF file with an embedded malicious OLE object is used to exploit the vulnerability.\n*    The vulnerability occurs when the Equation Editor executable is spawned and loads the malicious font name data.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Attacker needs the ability to deliver the malformed RTF file to the victim.\n*   No special privileges or user interaction beyond opening the file are required to trigger the vulnerability.",
