## Support us

BackBox.org is free of cost and it is funded by advertising, sponsoring and donations and although it is financially supported by its own community of users.

The money is used to finance the needs of the Project, to pay for hosting, to advertise on other websites, to purchase equipment and to fund the work of the people behind it.

The donations we receive range from a single dollar to a couple of hundreds. The important thing for us it’s to generate the income that will let us work and succeed on this project, month after month.
