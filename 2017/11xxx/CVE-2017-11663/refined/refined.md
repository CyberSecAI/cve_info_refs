  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs in the `_WM_SetupMidiEvent` function within `internal_midi.c`. A crafted MIDI file can cause a denial-of-service due to an invalid memory read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Invalid memory read",
       "Incorrect handling of sysex length in relation to event data",
       "Memory corruption via memcpy"

      "Crafted MIDI file",
       "Specifically crafted MIDI file with a large sysex_len value that leads to an out-of-bounds memory read or write"
