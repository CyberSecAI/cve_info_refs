  "CVE-2017-11334": {
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds read/write access due to improper handling of guest RAM access during DMA operations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read/write access"
    ],
    "Impact": "A privileged user within the guest could exploit the vulnerability to crash the QEMU process resulting in denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "DMA operations within the guest"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A privileged user inside the guest is required to trigger the DMA operations that lead to out of bounds access."
