The content is related to CVE-2017-11098.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV) that occurs within the `png_load` function of the `png2swf` tool in swftools. The crash is triggered when processing a crafted PNG file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an access violation during the processing of a PNG file within the `png_load` function, leading to a segmentation fault. The provided crash report shows a SEGV on an unknown address, indicating a memory access error.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the `png2swf` tool. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) if an attacker can supply a crafted PNG image to be processed.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted PNG file, which is provided as input to the `png2swf` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PNG file as input to the `png2swf` tool. The attacker also needs to execute the `png2swf` program, which is likely a command-line tool and can be done locally.
