Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11693:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Medhost Document Management System contains hard-coded credentials for both the customer database (PostgreSQL) and Apache Solr. These credentials are the same across all installations, and customers are unable to change them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded credentials:** The application stores the usernames and passwords for the PostgreSQL database and Apache Solr within configuration files ( `database.properties` and `solr.properties`)
*   **Lack of password management:** Customers cannot change these default credentials.
*   **Default ports:** PostgreSQL listens on default port 5432, and Apache Solr listens on default port 8080.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with knowledge of these hard-coded credentials and network access to the affected systems could:
*   **Obtain sensitive information:** Access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive patient and financial data stored in the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Modify sensitive information:** Alter patient and financial records in the database.
*   **Access indexed patient documents:** Gain access to all indexed patient documents stored within Apache Solr.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based attack:** An attacker needs network access to the application database server.
*   **Credential reuse:** The hardcoded credentials work across all installations allowing an attacker with knowledge of the credentials to use them to gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of hard-coded credentials:** The attacker must know the usernames and passwords for the PostgreSQL database ("dms") and Apache Solr ("dms")
*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the PostgreSQL database server on port 5432 and the Apache Solr server on port 8080.
