```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a type confusion issue in the Chakra JIT compiler related to the `OP_Memset` operation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Chakra JIT compiler fails to detect when the type of a variable changes after the `OP_Memset` operation, leading to type confusion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The provided PoC triggers the type confusion which leads to the program crashing.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted JavaScript code that exploits the type confusion in the JIT compiler.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute Javascript code on a system running Microsoft Edge that uses the Chakra engine."
