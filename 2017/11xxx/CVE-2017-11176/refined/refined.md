  "CVE-2017-11176": {
    "description": "The mq_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed (use-after-free) which may lead to memory corruption or other unspecified other impact.",
    "vulnerability": "Use-after-free",
    "impact": "Memory corruption or other unspecified impact, denial of service, and potentially privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vector": "Local",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user able to open a Netlink socket."
