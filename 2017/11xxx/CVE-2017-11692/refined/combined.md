| [Description](#c0)  John Lyon    2004-09-02 16:02:43 UTC  ``` When installing the aimsniff 0.9-r1 ebuild, although the apache2 flag is set, the ebuild does not install apache as a dependency like it should.  This could be due to the the changes in the net-www ebuild category a month or so ago.  I installed apache2 manually at first, then installed aimsniff with apache2 support.  The Web Aimsniff Module (WAS) is not installed with the rest of aimsniff.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.emerge aimsniff 2.try to run webmodule 3.  Actual Results:   web module not installed  Expected Results:   web module should have installed ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Gustavo Felisberto (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-03 02:47:43 UTC  ``` bug-wranglers AKA seemant added this to net-im and this is not net-im, Ian this is your playground. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Ian Leitch (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-03 03:08:47 UTC  ``` aimsniff is missing a dep on apache2, thanks for that. Though as for WAS, it is installed via webapp-config. You need to use webapp-config to install WAS into the  htdocs dir.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ian Leitch (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-23 16:26:16 UTC  ``` Fixed in CVS.  the local flag 'http' now pulls in the WAS frontend and 'apache2' is now used how it's meant to be.  ``` |  |
