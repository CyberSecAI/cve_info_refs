The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Fiyo CMS.

**Root Cause:** The primary root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation for various parameters in multiple PHP files. The application uses PDO, which allows for the execution of stacked queries when vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to unfiltered or insufficiently filtered user-supplied input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to properly sanitize parameters such as `id`, `art_title`, `cat`, `user`, `level`, `comment`, `name`, `web`, `email`, `status`, `parent_id`, `desc`, and `keys` obtained via `$_POST`, `$_GET`, and `$_REQUEST`.
*   **Use of Stacked Queries:**  The use of PDO with the ability to execute stacked queries exacerbates the issue, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, data deletion, and even full system compromise if the database user has sufficient privileges.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Sensitive data stored in the database can be extracted by malicious actors.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially cause a denial of service by injecting queries that cause the server to hang or crash.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete stored data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST requests:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in files like `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php`, `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php`, and others by injecting malicious SQL code in POST parameters.
*   **HTTP GET requests:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in files like `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php`, `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php`, `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php`, and others by injecting malicious SQL code in GET parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:** While the attacks are relatively simple, some knowledge of the application's structure is helpful to craft effective attacks.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations:**
The following files are identified as vulnerable with the associated vulnerable parameters:

1.  `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php`: `$_POST['id']` and `$_POST['art_title']`
2.  `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php`:  `$_POST` parameters including `send`, `name`, `email`, `url`, and `text`.
3.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php`:  `$_GET['cat']`, `$_GET['user']`, `$_GET['level']`, and `$_GET['iSortCol'.$i]`
4.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php`: `$_GET['id']`
5.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php`: `$_GET['id']`
6.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/sys_article.php`: `$_POST['parent_id']`, `$_POST['desc']`, `$_POST['keys']`, `$_POST['level']`, and many other POST parameters in add/edit category and article functions.
7.  `/dapur/apps/app_comment/controller/comment_status.php`: `$_GET['id']`
8.  `/dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php`: `$_POST['comment']`, `$_POST['name']`, `$_POST['web']`, `$_POST['email']`, `$_POST['status']`, `$_POST['id']` in edit comment; and `$_REQUEST['id']` in enable/disable comment.
