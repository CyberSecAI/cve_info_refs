{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Chakra JavaScript engine fails to detect if a variable escapes its scope. Due to this, it incorrectly allocates the variable on the stack, potentially leading to the dereferencing of uninitialized stack values.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect escape analysis",
    "Dereference of uninitialized stack values"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Dereferencing uninitialized stack values, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "Executing specially crafted JavaScript code within Microsoft Edge.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of Microsoft Edge."
