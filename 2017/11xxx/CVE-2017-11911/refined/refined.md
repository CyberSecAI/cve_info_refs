```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from a type confusion in the Chakra JavaScript engine's asm.js implementation. When initializing a variable with the value of a constant, the compiler incorrectly looks up the constant value, leading to a failure to find the expected type in the constant table.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read due to incorrect handling of variable initialization within asm.js code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a specific asm.js code that triggers the type confusion during variable initialization.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute crafted JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable browser (Microsoft Edge)."
