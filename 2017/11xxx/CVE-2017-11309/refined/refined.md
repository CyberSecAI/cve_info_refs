Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-11309:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the Avaya IP Office SoftConsole client. When the SoftConsole client connects to an IP Office server, it receives a response which is then placed into a variable without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of bounds checking when reading the server response.
- Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- Exploitable via a network connection to a malicious server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the system running the vulnerable SoftConsole client.
- Attackers can deliver and execute attacker-supplied code.
- The vulnerability allows for remote code execution if the client connects to a malicious server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious server is required to serve an oversized response to the SoftConsole client when it connects.
- The attacker needs to be positioned as an attacker controlled server that the Avaya SoftConsole will connect to.
- The SoftConsole application connects to a malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a malicious server that the Avaya IP Office SoftConsole user will connect to.
- Ability to send a crafted response to the SoftConsole client.
- Basic understanding of buffer overflows, SEH exploitation on Windows platform.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Avaya IP Office versions 9.1.x, 10.0 through 10.1.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is provided which leverages SEH overwrite
- The exploit targets the client making an outbound connection to the malicious server
- The exploit shows an example using a shellcode to call `wusa.exe`
