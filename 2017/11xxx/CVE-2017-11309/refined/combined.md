IP Office SoftConsole Buffer Overflow

Original Release Date: November 3, 2017

Last Revised: November 3, 2017

Number: ASA-2017-307

Overall Severity Classification: Medium

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

IP Office™ Platform provides a single, stackable, scalable small business communications system that grows with your business easily and cost-effectively.
 The SoftConsole client is a separately installable application provided with IP Office. It was discovered that when the SoftConsole connects to IP Office, it appears to place the response from the server into a variable without proper bounds checking. If a malicious server responds with an excessive amount of data, this data will overflow the buffer and overwrite the instruction pointer for the process.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2017-11309](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11309) to this issue.

Avaya would like to thank John (hyp3rlinx) Page of ApparitionSec for reporting this issue.

## 2. Avaya System Products that provide an affected version of SoftConsole:

For assessment and severity classification details refer to Section 3 of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100045520).
The "Resolution" column will be updated as fixes are made available. Please reference the "Information" column for any additional information regarding the affected product.

| Product: | Version(s): | Resolution: | Information: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya IP Office | 9.1.x, 10.0 through 10.1 | 10.1.1 or later | This buffer overflow vulnerability could potentially be used to execute malicious code on a system running the SoftConsole application that connects to a malicious server. |

### CVSS 3.0 Scoring and Metrics:

Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3
(CVSSv3) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected
component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSSv3 base score and metrics. Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSSv3 scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment. For more information on CVSS and how the score is calculated, see
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.0: Specification Document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).

| Vulnerability | CVSSv3 Base Score | CVSSv3 Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2017-11309 | 6.9 (Medium) | [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L) |

Vulnerability Type:
===================
Remote Buffer Overflow
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-11309
ASA-2017-307
Security Issue:
================
SoftConsole.exe does not check bounds when reading server response on making an outbound connection, resulting in a classic
Buffer Overflow exploit.
Avaya IP Office user must connect to a malicious server where a remote attacker can then deliver the buffer overflow
payload in the server response, exploiting the SoftConsole client. This vulnerability allows attackers to deliver and
execute arbitrary attacker supplied code on the Avaya host system.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
