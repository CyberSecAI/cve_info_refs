Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-11695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `alloc_segs` function within `lib/dbm/src/hash.c` of Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, a write of size 8 bytes occurs outside the allocated memory region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unspecified impact, including potential arbitrary code execution. The provided report indicates it could cause a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a crafted `cert8.db` file.
- Attack requires a local access with ability to modify the profile directory to use the crafted `cert8.db` file.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using the `certutil` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted `cert8.db` file to the application using NSS.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the legacy DBM code, which has been replaced by a SQLite datastore.
- The issue is present in versions of NSS prior to 3.49.
- The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop.
- The bug report indicates that this issue is not exploitable remotely but requires local access/modification to the profile directory.
- The issue was marked as WONTFIX due to the code being legacy and scheduled for removal.
