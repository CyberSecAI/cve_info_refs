{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The libICE library uses weak entropy when generating session cookies, relying on `gettimeofday()` and `srand()` seeded with time and process ID. This results in predictable session keys.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak entropy generation",
      "Predictable session keys"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can easily retrieve session keys (within 2-3 seconds according to the provided PoC), potentially leading to privilege escalation. In the context of X11, this allows an attacker to connect to another user's X server and potentially inject commands.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation. An attacker needs local access to the machine to exploit the weak session key generation. The attacker can then use the predictable keys to connect to a valid X session.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access to the machine.",
      "additional_details": "The fix involves replacing the weak entropy sources with `getrandom()` syscall, and if that's not available, falling back to reading from `/dev/urandom`. Also, a file descriptor leak was found in `gnome-session` when attempting to connect with the vulnerable `libICE`, which has also been fixed. The `gnome-session` issue has been assigned CVE-2017-11171."
