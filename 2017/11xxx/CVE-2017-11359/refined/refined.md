Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-11359:

**CVE-2017-11359**

*   **Root Cause:** A divide-by-zero error occurs within the `wavwritehdr` function in `wav.c` when processing a crafted SND file that is converted to a WAV file. Specifically, the division operation `blocksWritten = MS_UNSPEC/wBlockAlign;` results in a division by zero when `wBlockAlign` is zero.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The code lacks proper validation of the `wBlockAlign` variable before performing the division operation.
    *   The `wavwritehdr` function does not handle the case where `wBlockAlign` can be zero.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the application to crash due to the divide-by-zero error.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted SND file as input to the SoX utility. This crafted file, when converted to WAV, triggers the divide-by-zero in the `wavwritehdr` function.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to provide the crafted SND file to the SoX utility for processing.
    *   No special privileges are required; the attack can be triggered by a regular user.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs at line 1457 of the `wav.c` file:
```c
1457        blocksWritten = MS_UNSPEC/wBlockAlign;
```
The provided debug information confirms that the program crashes with a SIGFPE signal at this line, and the value of `0x10(%rsp)`, which corresponds to `wBlockAlign` is 0, resulting in the division by zero.

**Affected Versions:**

*   SoX version 14.4.2 is confirmed to be vulnerable.
*   The fix was included in version 14.4.2-r1 according to the Gentoo Security Advisory.
*   Debian LTS also addressed this issue in versions 14.4.0-3+deb7u2 and 14.4.1-5+deb8u3.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit requires a specially crafted SND file that will cause the `wBlockAlign` to be zero when converted to WAV.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) files (`sox_14.4.2_divide_by_zero_error_2.snd`) demonstrate how to trigger this vulnerability.
