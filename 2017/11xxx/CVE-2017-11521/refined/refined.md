Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-11521:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `SdpContents::Session::Medium::parse` function within the reSIProcate SIP stack. This function parses the Session Description Protocol (SDP) and processes connection information. Specifically, when parsing the optional "<number of addresses>" field within the connection specification, the parser allocates a connection object for each address without enforcing an upper limit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the missing validation or limit on the number of addresses specified in the SDP connection field.  The parser does not check if the provided number is within reasonable bounds.
- **Unbounded Memory Allocation:**  The parser allocates memory for connection objects based on the provided "number of addresses". Since there's no limit, an attacker can specify an extremely large number, leading to excessive memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is a denial-of-service condition. By sending a specially crafted SDP message with a large number of addresses, an attacker can cause the application to allocate an excessive amount of memory, potentially exhausting available resources and crashing the application or making it unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network, as an attacker can send malicious SDP messages to a vulnerable reSIProcate application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic, specifically a crafted SDP message, to a vulnerable reSIProcate instance.
- **No Special Privileges:** No specific privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker doesn't need to be authenticated or have any special access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered using LLVM LibFuzzer.
- The fix involves limiting the number of allowed addresses to 255, preventing excessive memory allocation.
- The vulnerable code is in `resip/stack/SdpContents.cxx`.
- The fix was implemented in commit `4b8ffa5afd3291a2701f8d39c31ada443f79a5c8`.
- The vulnerability affects reSIProcate versions up to and including 1.10.2
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.12.0, which limits the address number to 255.
