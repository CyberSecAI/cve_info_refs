# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : resiprocate
Version        : 1:1.11.0~beta1-3+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11521 CVE-2018-12584
Debian Bug     : 869404 905495

Two vulnerabilities were fixed in the reSIProcate SIP stack.

CVE-2017-11521

    The SdpContents::Session::Medium::parse function allowed remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-12584

    The ConnectionBase::preparseNewBytes function allowed remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
    code when TLS communication is enabled.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.11.0~beta1-3+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your resiprocate packages.

For the detailed security status of resiprocate please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/resiprocate>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# [security] SDP Parser: out-of-memory condition (CVE-2017-11521)

* *From*: Gregor Jasny <gjasny@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx>
* *Date*: Sun, 6 Aug 2017 16:59:24 +0200

---

```
reSIProcate Security Advisory, August 6th, 2017

VULNERABILITY

The reSIProcate Session Description Protocol (SDP) parser contains a
flaw where remote attackers could cause a denial of service due to
excessive memory consumption.

INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2017-11521 to this issue.

When a SDP media type connection specification contains the optional
"<number of addresses>" field, the reSIProicate SDP parser allocates
one connection object per address without applying any upper limit.

For example the following lines in a SDP description would lead to
allocation of 20 billion connection objects that most probably will
exceed the available process address space:

m=audio 17124 RTP/AVP 0
c=IN IP4 192.168.2.122/127/2000000000

AFFECTED VERSIONS

This flaw exists in all reSIProcate releases up and including to 1.10.2.

THE SOLUTION

In the upcoming release 1.12.0, the parser now rejects more than 255
addresses.

A patch for CVE-2017-11521 is available here:
<https://github.com/resiprocate/resiprocate/commit/4b8ffa5afd3291a2701f8d39c31ada443f79a5c8>

TIME LINE

The issue was detected on July 21st, 2017 by Gregor Jasny using the LLVM
LibFuzzer implementation.

A patch was made available and merged to the master branch on July 25th,
2017.

Version        : 1:1.9.7-5+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11521 CVE-2018-12584

CVE-2018-12584
     A flaw in function ConnectionBase::preparseNewBytes of
     resip/stack/ConnectionBase.cxx has been detected, that
     allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
     (buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code
     when TLS communication is enabled.

CVE-2017-11521
     A flaw in function SdpContents::Session::Medium::parse of
     resip/stack/SdpContents.cxx has been detected, that allows
     remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
     consumption) by triggering many media connections.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.9.7-5+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your resiprocate packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
