Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11724

**Analysis:**

The provided content from `security.gentoo.org` indicates that CVE-2017-11724 is one of multiple vulnerabilities found in ImageMagick. The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201711-07) states that these vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-11724, could allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, and potentially other unspecified impacts.

The github content contains a memory leak issue report, which is not directly related to the description of CVE-2017-11724 as a remote denial of service vulnerability. It is likely another vulnerability report.

**Vulnerability Details (based on Gentoo advisory):**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist within ImageMagick. The specific cause for CVE-2017-11724 is not detailed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The advisory highlights multiple vulnerabilities in ImageMagick, with a focus on the potential for a remote DoS. The exact weakness exploited by CVE-2017-11724 is not specified in this document.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) is the primary, and confirmed impact stated.
    *   Other unspecified impacts are also possible.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attack involves enticing a user to process a specially crafted file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted image file to a user. This could be through various means such as email attachments, website uploads, etc.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Gentoo advisory provides a list of CVEs that were addressed in the same update for ImageMagick.
*   The github content is regarding a memory leak that occurs when processing a specific file, which is different from the description of CVE-2017-11724 as a remote DoS.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-11724 is one of multiple vulnerabilities within ImageMagick that could lead to a remote Denial of Service. The attacker needs to trick a user into processing a malicious image file. The exact technical details of the vulnerability are not in the provided content, but the impact and attack vector are mentioned.
