The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Hashtopussy 0.4.0, and includes details about the root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, and attacker capabilities for each.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **CSRF (Admin Password Change)**
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of cross-site request forgery protection on sensitive forms.
    *   **Weakness:** Absence of CSRF tokens or similar protection mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can change the administrator password without the admin's knowledge or consent.
    *   **Attack vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that includes a form that, when submitted by a logged-in admin, changes their password.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the attacker to trick an admin into visiting the attacker-controlled page while logged into the application.

2.  **Weak ACL**
    *   **Root cause:** Improper access control list configuration.
    *   **Weakness:** Users with limited privileges can access and perform actions that should only be accessible to administrators or higher roles.
    *   **Impact:** Lower-privileged users can add/delete vouchers, create agents, create and delete hashcat releases.
    *   **Attack vector:** The attacker exploits the lack of access control by sending requests to restricted endpoints with a valid user session.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:**  Requires a valid, but not necessarily admin, user session.

3.  **Stored XSS (Readable by any user or role)**
    *   **Root cause:** Unsanitized user input when creating a new hashcat release
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not sanitize or encode user-provided input that is later rendered on the page.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the hashcat release data, which is then executed in the browsers of anyone who visits the hashcat release page. This could lead to privilege escalation if executed by an administrative user.
    *   **Attack vector:** The attacker sends a malicious payload in the 'version', 'url', or 'rootdir' parameters when creating a new Hashcat release.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:**  Requires a valid user session, and the ability to create a new hashcat release.

4.  **Open Redirect**
    *   **Root cause:** The application allows the 'fw' parameter during login to control the redirect URL without proper validation.
    *   **Weakness:** Unvalidated user controlled redirect URL.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can redirect a user to a third-party website after a successful login, potentially for phishing or other malicious purposes.
    *   **Attack vector:** The attacker crafts a login request with the 'fw' parameter to redirect to a malicious site.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:**  Requires valid user credentials.

5.  **Reflective XSS (affecting only authenticated users)**
    *   **Root cause:** Unsanitized user input in the `hashes.php` page.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not sanitize user-provided input before displaying it on the page.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'hashlist', 'filter', or 'display' parameters, which is then executed in the browser of an authenticated user who visits the crafted URL.
    *   **Attack vector:**  The attacker creates a malicious URL with the injected script.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:**  Requires the victim to have an active authenticated user session.

6.  **Stored XSS (Only affecting user's session)**
     *   **Root cause:** Unsanitized user input in the notification creation.
    *   **Weakness:** The application stores user-provided input without sanitizing/encoding it, and the XSS is triggered when a user views the notifications.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the notification 'receiver' parameter, which is then executed in the browser of the user who created the notification when they view it.
    *  **Attack vector:**  The attacker creates a notification with a malicious payload.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires a valid user session.
