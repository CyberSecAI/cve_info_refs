{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `__get_page` function within the legacy DBM library of NSS (Network Security Services). This is due to incorrect handling of page allocation within the hash table implementation, leading to out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
       "Improper memory management",
      "Incorrect size calculation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution, if the corrupted data is crafted in a specific way to overwrite critical data structures in memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when `certutil` is used with a specially crafted `cert8.db` file. The crafted file is used as input to the function leading to the overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed or crafted cert8.db file to the application to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerable code is part of a legacy DBM implementation, which has been replaced by SQLite in modern versions of NSS. The reported issue is triggered with a malformed `cert8.db` file during a call to the `certutil` command. It should be noted that this is not a remotely exploitable vulnerability for Firefox users as it requires local modification of the profile directory and is not easily triggered remotely."
