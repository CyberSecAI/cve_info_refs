Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11124:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `xar_unserialize` function in `archive.c`. This occurs when the function attempts to write to a memory location pointed to by a NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to access memory via a pointer that is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The primary impact is a segmentation fault (SEGV) that causes the `xar` program to abort, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted xar archive: An attacker can create a specially crafted `.xar` archive file that triggers the NULL pointer dereference when processed by the vulnerable `xar` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and provide a malicious xar file to be processed by the `xar` tool.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The crash occurs during a write operation within the `xar_unserialize` function.
- The AddressSanitizer output indicates a write memory access to address 0x000000000008 which points to the zero page.
- The call stack shows that the crash happens when `xar_unserialize` is called by `xar_open`, which is in turn called by the `list` function and then finally from the `main` function.
- Affected version: xar 1.6.1

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post provides a reproducer link to a sample xar file that triggers this vulnerability.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the updated xar package (version 1.8.0.417.1) in Fedora 30 and 31, along with other security fixes.
- This CVE is related to another NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in `xar_get_path` (CVE-2017-11125).
