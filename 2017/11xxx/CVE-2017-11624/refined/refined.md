Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop within the `libqpdf` library when processing certain malformed PDF files. The issue arises during the parsing of the PDF file, specifically within the tokenization and object handling process. The stack trace shows a loop involving `QPDFTokenizer::resolveLiteral`, `QPDFObjectHandle::parseInternal`, and `QPDF::resolve`, indicating a recursive loop during object resolution and parsing. It appears the issue is triggered by a crafted regular expression that leads to a stack overflow in the PCRE library, which is used by qpdf.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** A crafted PDF file can cause an infinite loop during parsing, leading to a denial of service.
- **Stack Overflow:** The infinite loop eventually results in a stack overflow due to the repeated calls in the parsing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, as the infinite loop consumes resources and renders the qpdf program unresponsive.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly detailed in the provided stack trace. The stack overflow could potentially be exploited further but would require more specific details about memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted PDF File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file designed to trigger the infinite loop in `libqpdf`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PDF file to qpdf.
- No specific user privileges are required beyond being able to execute `qpdf` with the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided stack trace shows that the issue originates within the PCRE library during the compilation of a regular expression, which indicates a potential regex denial of service issue.
- The vulnerability is present in qpdf version 6.0.0 and is addressed in version 8.0.2 according to Ubuntu security notice USN-3638-1.
- The issue was reported by the ADLab of Venustech.
