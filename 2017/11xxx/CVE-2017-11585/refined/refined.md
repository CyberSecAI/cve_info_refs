The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS before version 5.0.9, including CVE-2017-11585. The specific vulnerability related to CVE-2017-11585 is:

**SQL injection via `$system['field']` parameter**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$system['field']` parameter is directly inserted into SQL queries without any sanitization or validation. This occurs in the `list_tag` function within `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php`, when `action` is set to `related`, `form`, `member`, or `module`.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive information from the database).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data in the database).
    *   In some cases, the ability to achieve further system compromise depending on database user privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `/index.php` with specific `c`, `m`, `auth`, and `param` parameters. The `param` parameter includes the crafted `action` and `field` values.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the website and craft the necessary HTTP request, including the `auth` parameter, which appears to be generated based on a `SYS_KEY`. This suggests the attacker might need some pre-existing knowledge or access to derive the required auth value.
