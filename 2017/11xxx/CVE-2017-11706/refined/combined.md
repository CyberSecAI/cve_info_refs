# Boozt Fashion Android App Didn’t Use SSL for Login [CVE-2017-11706]

[July 27, 2017](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/07/27/boozt-fashion-android-app-didnt-use-ssl-for-login-cve-2017-11706/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [boozt](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/boozt/)

# Summary

**Boozt Fashion App for Android** did not use encryption (SSL) for information transmission during login, exposing usernames and passwords to anyone monitoring the network. The vendor fixed this issue and users should install the latest version (**2.3.4 or above**). MITRE has assigned **CVE-2017-11706** to track this issue.

# Details

**Boozt Fashion / Boozt.com** is a Nordic-based, EU-spanning online store selling  various fashion brands. The vendor makes available an Android application that allows users to shop, checkout and pay for their orders.

While performing network level testing, we discovered that the calls made by the application to the server during login did not use any kind of encryption (SSL). This potentially exposed the usernames and passwords of those using the app to a network-level attacker. According to the vendor, financial information like credit card numbers were not exposed since SSL was used during the checkout process.

To replicate the issue on v2.0.2:

1. Install the application on the device (may be restricted to EU-only users and require sideloading).
2. Open the application, tap on the “person” icon until you reach the login screen.
3. Setup an MITM proxy but do not install the SSL certificate on the device (we used PacketCapture).
4. Start the proxy. At this point all network traffic will be going through the proxy with the SSL traffic being encrypted by a self-signed certificate which is not trusted by the device.
5. Go back to the app, put in a fake username and password, and tap the Login button.
6. Flick away the application.
7. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application version 2.0.2. Network captures were performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.

# Vendor Response

The issue was reported to the vendor via HackerOne. The vendor provided the following comments:

> *Thanks for the report. At the moment that is an accepted risk. We only have https on the checkout part of the site (most sensitive). However we have a planned change in the roadmap regarding HTTPS introduction in the customer login part.*
>
> *…*
>
> *We are not arguing that the report is not valid. We just inform you that based on our program guidelines this is considered as non-qualifying report. This is because we are aware of the issue and are already working on rolling HTTPS through out the site.*

Follow-up testing in July 2017 showed that this was fixed in current version (2.3.4) but may have been fixed earlier as well.

# Boozt Fashion Android App Didn’t Use SSL for Login [CVE-2017-11706]

[July 27, 2017](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/07/27/boozt-fashion-android-app-didnt-use-ssl-for-login-cve-2017-11706/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [boozt](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/boozt/)

# Summary

**Boozt Fashion App for Android** did not use encryption (SSL) for information transmission during login, exposing usernames and passwords to anyone monitoring the network. The vendor fixed this issue and users should install the latest version (**2.3.4 or above**). MITRE has assigned **CVE-2017-11706** to track this issue.

# Details

**Boozt Fashion / Boozt.com** is a Nordic-based, EU-spanning online store selling  various fashion brands. The vendor makes available an Android application that allows users to shop, checkout and pay for their orders.

While performing network level testing, we discovered that the calls made by the application to the server during login did not use any kind of encryption (SSL). This potentially exposed the usernames and passwords of those using the app to a network-level attacker. According to the vendor, financial information like credit card numbers were not exposed since SSL was used during the checkout process.

To replicate the issue on v2.0.2:

1. Install the application on the device (may be restricted to EU-only users and require sideloading).
2. Open the application, tap on the “person” icon until you reach the login screen.
3. Setup an MITM proxy but do not install the SSL certificate on the device (we used PacketCapture).
4. Start the proxy. At this point all network traffic will be going through the proxy with the SSL traffic being encrypted by a self-signed certificate which is not trusted by the device.
5. Go back to the app, put in a fake username and password, and tap the Login button.
6. Flick away the application.
7. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application version 2.0.2. Network captures were performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.

# Vendor Response

The issue was reported to the vendor via HackerOne. The vendor provided the following comments:

> *Thanks for the report. At the moment that is an accepted risk. We only have https on the checkout part of the site (most sensitive). However we have a planned change in the roadmap regarding HTTPS introduction in the customer login part.*
>
> *…*
>
> *We are not arguing that the report is not valid. We just inform you that based on our program guidelines this is considered as non-qualifying report. This is because we are aware of the issue and are already working on rolling HTTPS through out the site.*

Follow-up testing in July 2017 showed that this was fixed in current version (2.3.4) but may have been fixed earlier as well.

December 30, 2024Would be perfect if they can deliver based on their target date as much as possible. Should anticipate more orders specially before holidays. Lame excuse about not anticipating the volume of orders and delays. Improve your logistics and strategies on this. I heard a lot i know complain for slow delivery like 3weeks to 1 month. Sad if u cant compete with temu and shein. Waste of branded products if this online platform cant commit. Vouchers are useless wont order again.Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJokIFSBTUJzxjKSEA8cbmUfhr81_hzHQ50Sh4egPP1Mw7Yk-g=s32-rw-mo)Gazi Mousa*more\_vert*

August 23, 2024Useless app/shop. Got blocked from ordering because i sent back the suit that was not fit. Customer service told me it is fine and i can send it back and get the right size. After i returned the package i cannot order because of some fair use policy. Stay away or just use somewhere else that wont block you for not fitting in clothes.Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW9dkrNgim2FwZC9L7QNRHl6icuJtTPSMDxNygfFeL1vvM_S3Zo=s32-rw)Amorinho*more\_vert*

October 22, 2024App is fine. Boozt just way too slow to pay back money and also never confirm that they received the item which would be nice so we don't have to worry. Could learn from Zalando.Did you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
