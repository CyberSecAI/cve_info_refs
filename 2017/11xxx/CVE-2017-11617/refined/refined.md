The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2017-11617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of HTML content in emails within the atmail 7 webmail client, allowing a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied HTML content in emails. Specifically, the application's filtering mechanism can be bypassed by crafting an `<img>` tag with specific attributes and double quotes to inject malicious Javascript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stealing user contacts
- Sending arbitrary emails
- Exposing inbox contents
- Propagation of the vulnerability through an XSS worm by sending malicious emails to a victim's contacts.
- Spam, malware delivery, and phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted email containing the malicious XSS payload to a victim's inbox. The victim must view the email in atmail's webmail client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send an email to a victim who is using atmail 7.
- The attacker does not need any prior access to the victim's account.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious email with HTML content.
