**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure creation of the PID file after dropping privileges.
- Lack of proper checks on the ownership and permissions of the PID file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to root
- Ability to kill arbitrary processes on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required
- The attacker needs to be able to modify or control the `tenshi.pid` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account on the system.
- Ability to manipulate files in the file system, specifically the pid file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in `app-admin/tenshi` versions prior to 0.17.
- The fix involves updating to `app-admin/tenshi-0.17` or a later version.
- The related Gentoo bug report is 626654.
