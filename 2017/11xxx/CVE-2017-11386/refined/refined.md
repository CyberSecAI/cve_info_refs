Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11386

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `cmdHandlerNewReportScheduler.dll` when executing opcode `0x4707`.
- The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before using them to construct SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is that the application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute code within the context of the database server by exploiting the SQL Injection.
- **Complete compromise of the database:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the database potentially reading, altering, or deleting sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Direct SQL injection:** The attack vector is a direct SQL injection vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable Trend Micro Control Manager server.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- Trend Micro has released an update to fix this issue.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a digital vaccine filter with ID '28009'.

**Summary:**
This CVE describes a critical vulnerability in Trend Micro Control Manager that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the database server due to a SQL injection flaw.
