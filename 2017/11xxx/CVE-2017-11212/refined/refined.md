Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11212:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within ImageConversion's EMF (Enhanced Metafile) parsing in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, the issue stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The inadequate validation of user-supplied data can lead to a write operation that exceeds the allocated buffer for the EMF object, causing a memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user process. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: The user must open a specially crafted PDF file containing malicious EMF data to trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious web page: The user must visit a malicious web page that uses a crafted EMF file in order to trigger the vulnerability through the affected application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or host malicious PDF documents or websites that leverage the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required, as the victim has to open the malicious file or visit the malicious website.
