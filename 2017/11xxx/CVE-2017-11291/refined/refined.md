Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-11291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input that's used to construct requests made by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this SSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass network access controls. This means an attacker could potentially interact with internal services or resources that are not directly exposed to the outside world.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through maliciously crafted requests sent to the Adobe Connect server. The server, upon processing these requests, would be tricked into making requests to attacker-specified internal or external resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Adobe Connect server. No specific privileged position is mentioned but network access to the server is implied.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is associated with Adobe Connect and has a Critical severity rating.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Adobe Connect version 9.7.
- The report also mentions other vulnerabilities that were fixed in the same update, including multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities and a UI redressing (clickjacking) vulnerability.
