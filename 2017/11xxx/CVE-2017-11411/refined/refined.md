Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the openSAFETY dissector within Wireshark's libwireshark. This overflow occurs during memory allocation, where a very large size is requested (4294967295 bytes), exceeding the maximum allocation size (2147483648 bytes) leading to memory exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in the openSAFETY dissector.
- Unbounded memory allocation based on potentially attacker-controlled data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Exhaustion:**  The large allocation request can cause Wireshark to consume excessive system memory, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
- **Crash:**  If the memory allocation fails or leads to other issues, it can cause Wireshark to crash.
- **CPU Resource Consumption:** It might be possible to consume excessive CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a specially crafted openSAFETY packet onto the network.
- **Malicious Packet Trace File:** An attacker can convince a user to open a malformed packet capture file containing the malicious packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic that can be analyzed by Wireshark, or provide a crafted pcap file
- The attacker does not require any authentication

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was discovered by the OSS-Fuzz project.
- The provided content indicates that this is a duplicate of issue 13649, which was also related to excessive memory allocation.
-  The vulnerability is addressed in Wireshark versions 2.2.8 and 2.0.14.
