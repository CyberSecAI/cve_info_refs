{
  "CVE-2017-11909": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The JIT compiler in Microsoft Edge Chakra does not properly handle empty loops after memory operations during optimization. Specifically, the `BackwardPass::RemoveEmptyLoopAfterMemOp` method removes loops without considering branches, which can lead to incorrect control flow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect optimization logic in JIT compiler.",
      "Improper removal of empty loops leading to broken control flow."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) due to the program entering an unexpected state or generating incorrect output.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code that triggers the JIT compiler optimization flaw.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to deliver the crafted Javascript code to a user through a medium that loads the code in Microsoft Edge."
  }
