```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `WriteMAPImage` function in `coders/map.c` did not properly handle the case when the input image was not already colormapped. It attempted to use a colormap without ensuring it had been initialized causing a null pointer dereference.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Null pointer dereference"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A null pointer dereference could lead to a segmentation fault (SEGV), causing a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted image file using GraphicsMagick's MAP image writer where the input image is not colormapped",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a non-colormapped image to GraphicsMagick to trigger the vulnerable code."
