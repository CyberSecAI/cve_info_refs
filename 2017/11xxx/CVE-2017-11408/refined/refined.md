Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11408:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the AMQP dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, it is triggered by a malformed AMQP packet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A stack-overflow vulnerability, leading to a crash.
- The specific nature of the malformed packet that triggers the vulnerability is not detailed in the provided content, but it's related to how the AMQP dissector handles certain input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a crash of the Wireshark application. This prevents the user from analyzing network traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious network traffic:** An attacker can inject a crafted, malformed AMQP packet onto the network. If Wireshark is capturing this traffic, the application will crash when attempting to dissect the packet.
- **Malicious capture file:** An attacker could convince a user to open a specially crafted packet capture file containing the malformed AMQP packet which leads to the application crashing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either inject malicious network traffic that Wireshark captures or provide a malicious pcap file to a Wireshark user.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the OSS-Fuzz project.
- The provided information states that this vulnerability is addressed in Wireshark versions 2.2.8 and 2.0.14 and later.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Debian versions of Wireshark as well, detailed in the provided DSA and DLA announcements.
