The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in OpenExif 2.1.4, with CVE-2017-11115 being one of them. Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-11115:

**Vulnerability Details (CVE-2017-11115):**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in the `ExifJpegHUFFTable::deriveTable` function within `src/ExifHuffmanTable.cpp`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper bounds checking while processing Huffman tables within a JPEG file, leading to a buffer overflow.
*  **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash) due to memory corruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted JPEG file processed by OpenExif.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JPEG file to be processed by the vulnerable software.

**Technical Details:**

The provided output from AddressSanitizer shows a heap-buffer-overflow occurring when `ExifJpegHUFFTable::deriveTable` attempts to write to memory outside of the allocated buffer. The stack trace shows the call path starting from the main program, going through ExifOpenFile, ExifImageFile, and ultimately to the vulnerable function. The specific memory address causing the issue is highlighted in the output.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also mentions three other vulnerabilities:
    *   CVE-2017-11116: Heap-buffer-overflow in `ExifImageFile::readDQT`.
    *   CVE-2017-11117: Heap-buffer-overflow in `ExifImageFile::readDHT`.
    *   CVE-2017-11118: Infinite loop in `ExifImageFile::readImage`.
*   The provided text includes proof of concept (POC) files for the vulnerabilities.
