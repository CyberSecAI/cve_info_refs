Subject: CVE-2017-11434 Qemu: slirp: out-of-bounds read while parsing dhcp
 options

    Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the BOOTP/DHCP Server support is vulnerable to
an OOB read issue. It could occur while parsing the DHCP options and vendor
extensions options sent by a client.

A user/process could use this flaw to potentially crash the Qemu process on
the host resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-07/msg05001.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1472611>

This issue was reported by Reno Robert. CVE assigned via - <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] slirp: check len against dhcp options array end

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

While parsing dhcp options string in 'dhcp_decode', if an options'
length 'len' appeared towards the end of 'bp_vend' array, ensuing
read could lead to an OOB memory access issue. Add check to avoid it.
