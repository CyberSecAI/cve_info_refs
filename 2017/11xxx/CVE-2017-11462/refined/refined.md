Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11462:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the GSS-API implementation's behavior of automatically deleting an existing security context on subsequent calls to `gss_init_sec_context()` or `gss_accept_sec_context()` if the call results in an error.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when the `internal_ctx_id` within a larger union context is set to `GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT`, and the security context structure is deleted and then later the larger union context is also freed, resulting in a double-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free condition, where memory allocated for the security context is freed twice. This occurs due to the automatic context deletion on error.
- **Incorrect Context Management:** The GSS-API implementation incorrectly manages security context lifecycle on error conditions. RFC 2744 permits this behavior but recommends that on a failed subsequent call the caller be responsible for deleting the context.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** A double-free can lead to memory corruption.
- **Crash:** The most likely impact of this vulnerability is a crash due to the double-free. According to one source, the crash is expected to occur in rare circumstances.
- **Unspecified Impact:** The CVE description mentions "unspecified impact" which is clarified by other sources as the crash. While a double free can sometimes be leveraged to gain code execution, that is not indicated as likely in this case.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when an application calls `gss_init_sec_context()` or `gss_accept_sec_context()` and subsequent calls fail, causing the security context to be automatically deleted.
- The vulnerability is within the GSS-API layer, suggesting an attack would involve interactions at that level.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker would need to be in a position to interact with a vulnerable application using the GSS-API.
- The attacker would need to trigger a series of calls to `gss_init_sec_context()` or `gss_accept_sec_context()` that result in an error after an initial successful call, leading to the double-free condition.
- No specific privileges or user interaction are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5).
- The fix involves modifying the GSS-API implementation to preserve existing security contexts on error until the caller explicitly deletes them, instead of automatically deleting them.
- The fix was implemented in commit [56f7b1b](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/56f7b1bc95a2a3eeb420e069e7655fb181ade5cf)
- The vulnerability was present in MIT krb5 versions prior to the fix, including 1.13.4 through 1.13.7, 1.14.1 through 1.14.5, and 1.15 through 1.15.1.
- The vulnerability is rated as Critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
- This is a network based attack, with low complexity, no privileges or user interaction needed with high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
