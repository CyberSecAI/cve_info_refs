{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Uninitialized variable in `jscript!JsArraySlice` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `JsArraySlice` function expects `NameTbl::GetVal()` to return an integer < 0 if the input object does not contain the 'length' property. However, in this specific scenario, `NameTbl::GetVal()` returns 1, and the length variable is not initialized. Subsequently, `ConvertToScalar()` is called with invalid arguments, leading to a potential virtual method call on an uninitialized pointer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to an access violation, and potentially remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by: \n  - Opening a malicious web page in Internet Explorer. \n - An attacker on the local network could exploit this issue by posing as a WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) host and sending a malicious wpad.dat file to the victim.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to either host a malicious website that is accessed by the victim using Internet Explorer or needs to be on the same local network as the victim, capable of acting as a WPAD host."
