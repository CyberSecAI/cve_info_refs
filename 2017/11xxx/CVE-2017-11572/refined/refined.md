{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `readcfftopdicts` function within the `parsettf.c` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation while parsing a crafted OpenType font file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) or achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the heap buffer overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a malicious OpenType font file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious OpenType font file. The user must then be tricked into opening this file with FontForge."
