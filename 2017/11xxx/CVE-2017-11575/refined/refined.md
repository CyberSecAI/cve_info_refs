Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11575:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `strnmatch` function within the `char.c` file of the FontForge software. Specifically, a global buffer overflow occurs due to improper bounds checking when processing font data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The `strnmatch` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash and potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution. This occurs due to the function not correctly verifying the length of the input before proceeding to access memory locations.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The root cause indicates a lack of proper validation of input within the FontForge software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is the application crash due to the buffer overflow, leading to denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory mentions that an attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code, which indicates that a malicious attacker could craft the input to overwrite program memory, potentially redirecting program control or installing malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Font File:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted OpenType font file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious font file that exploits the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to get a victim user to open the crafted font file using the vulnerable version of FontForge.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided github issue report includes the specific crash log including the location of the crash in `char.c`. It also details the specific code path and functions that get called in order.
- The debian security advisory confirms the vulnerability and that it leads to both denial of service and potential arbitrary code execution. It also mentions that the vulnerability affects multiple CVEs, including CVE-2017-11575.
- The advisory also details the fixed version of FontForge for stable and oldstable versions of Debian.
- The vulnerability is located within the strnmatch function, which means that the vulnerability is triggered by processing a string, which is also stated in the provided crash logs.
