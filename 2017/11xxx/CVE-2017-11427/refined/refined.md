Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-11427:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from inconsistencies in how different XML libraries and manual parsing methods handle comments within XML nodes when extracting text content, specifically within SAML responses.
*   Some XML libraries like `lxml` and `REXML`'s `get_text` method only return the text content up to the first comment node, while others like `xml.etree.ElementTree` return all text content including after comment nodes.
*   SAML libraries that use the former behavior, or extract text manually, are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The core weakness is the ability to bypass authentication by manipulating the SAML response.
*   **Inconsistent XML Parsing:** Different XML libraries handle text extraction differently, leading to inconsistencies in parsing.
*   **Incorrect XML Canonicalization:** SAML implementations were not correctly handling canonicalization, and were not using `xml-exc-c14n#WithComments` that includes comments, allowing manipulation of the SAML content without invalidating the signature.
*   **Faulty Text Extraction:** Some SAML libraries or applications were manually extracting text without proper handling of comments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can modify the SAML response, specifically the `NameID` field, to impersonate another user without knowing their credentials. The signature will remain valid as the comments are removed by canonicalization.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to resources and services that are protected by SAML-based SSO as a different user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SAML Response Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the SAML `Response`, specifically the `NameID` field, by adding a comment.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, this vulnerability could potentially be exploited in a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker intercepts and modifies a SAML response in transit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Account with the Identity Provider (IdP):** The attacker needs a legitimate account on the IdP to generate an initial, valid SAML response.
*   **Ability to Modify SAML Response:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify their own SAML response before it reaches the service provider (SP).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found to affect multiple vendors and SAML libraries.
*   The vulnerability exists because the canonicalization process typically removes comments, while some XML APIs stop reading text after the first comment.
*   The blog post from Duo provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, as well as example code demonstrating the issue.
*   Duo Security's product, the Duo Network Gateway (DNG), was also affected (CVE-2018-7340).
*   The vulnerability is not always exploitable depending on how email addresses and user identifiers are handled.
*   The most secure remediation is updating the SAML processing libraries.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Kelby Ludwig of Duo Security.
