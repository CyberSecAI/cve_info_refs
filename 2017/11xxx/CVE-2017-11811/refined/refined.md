Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11811

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the Chakra JavaScript engine, specifically related to the optimization of switch statements in the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.  The Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) phase incorrectly replaces a variable that is type-checked with another variable that is not type-checked leading to the type confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Type Confusion:** The JIT compiler's optimization, particularly during the CSE phase, replaces a variable ('s28' which represents an offset into a jump table) that's expected to be of type Int32 with another variable ('j') that could potentially be of a different type due to type changes in the javascript. Specifically, it attempts to ensure the type of 'i' as Int32 via a `BailOutExpectingInteger`, but it fails to propagate this type to the result of `i-2` if the result is stored in a separate variable which is then used as offset.
- **Incorrect Optimization:** The CSE phase incorrectly replaces a variable that is type-checked with one that is not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The type confusion leads to a crash. The provided crash log shows an invalid memory access attempt (`mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rdx+r13*8]`) due to the incorrect offset variable which causes the program to terminate abnormally.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JavaScript Code:** The vulnerability is triggered by carefully crafted JavaScript code that exploits the JIT compiler's type handling during switch statement optimization. The provided code demonstrates a loop with a switch statement, combined with a later type change of a related variable within the loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within a context that utilizes the vulnerable Chakra engine. This typically involves web browsing using Microsoft Edge or running Javascript using Windows Script Host.
- No specific user interaction is needed, just the execution of the vulnerable code.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs when the Chakra JIT compiler optimizes a switch statement using a variable derived from a loop counter. If this derived variable is replaced with another variable that is not ensured to be an integer and the loop counter is later altered to a non-integer value, the offset into a jump table becomes invalid. The engine attempts to dereference memory at an invalid location, leading to a crash.

The provided proof of concept code shows how changing the loop counter `i` to a string will make the derived offset variable `j` also become a string, but the jump table access will still expect it to be an integer, leading to the crash.
