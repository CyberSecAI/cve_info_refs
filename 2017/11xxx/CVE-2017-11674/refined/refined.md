The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11674.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner 8 Reporter.exe crashes due to a malformed .PRE file being processed by the application. The vulnerability occurs in the `madTraceProcess` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Write Access Violation:** A write operation attempts to write to an invalid memory address (0x0c9f0000). The instruction causing this is `mov byte ptr [eax],cl` where `eax` holds the invalid address.
- **Read Access Violation:** A read operation attempts to read from an invalid memory address (0x0c9f0000). The instruction causing this is `mov cl,byte ptr [edx]` where `edx` holds the invalid address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash (denial of service).
- The write access violation is marked as "EXPLOITABLE". While this analysis indicates the vulnerability can be exploited, it does not provide details on how.
- The read access violation is marked as "UNKNOWN".

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed .PRE file. The vulnerability is triggered when the Acunetix Reporter.exe processes a crafted .PRE file using the `/v` command line argument.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .PRE file to the Acunetix reporter application, typically through user interaction or through another vulnerability that allows local file system manipulation.
- The attacker must have the capability to execute `Reporter.exe` with the crafted .PRE file as an argument.
