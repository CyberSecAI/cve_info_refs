The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11670.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a negative value for `usernamelen` in the `extract_eapusername` function of eapmd5pass, leading to an invalid `memcpy` call. The `usernamelen` is calculated by subtracting 5 from the EAP packet length (`eaplen`). If the EAP packet length is less than 5, `usernamelen` becomes negative. The `memcpy` function does not handle negative size arguments, resulting in the crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Negative-size parameter in `memcpy`.
- Lack of proper input validation when calculating the length of the username field in EAP packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the `eapmd5pass` process.
- The crash is caused by a negative size parameter passed to `memcpy`, which leads to program termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted network traffic containing malicious EAP packets. Specifically, EAP packets with a length less than 5 bytes.
- Local: opening a crafted .pcap file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send crafted network packets to the machine running `eapmd5pass`. This implies a network-based attack vector. The attacker could also provide a crafted .pcap file locally.
