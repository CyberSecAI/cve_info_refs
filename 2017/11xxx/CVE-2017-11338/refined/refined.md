The provided content relates to CVE-2017-11338.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop within the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function in `image.cpp` of the exiv2 library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the `printIFDStructure` function processes image metadata, specifically when handling directory structures. A crafted input can cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as the `start` variable is not correctly managed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A crafted input can trigger an infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The program becomes unresponsive and consumes resources, preventing it from serving legitimate requests.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted image file. By providing this malicious input to the `exiv2` tool, an attacker can trigger the infinite loop and cause a denial of service. The provided example is triggered by executing `./exiv2 $POC` where `$POC` is a crafted image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted input file to the vulnerable `exiv2` tool. This could be achieved through various means, such as uploading a malicious file to a system that processes it or convincing a user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable software.
