The provided content relates to a memory leak issue in ImageMagick, specifically in the `AcquireImage()` function, and it is not related to CVE-2017-11751

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs within the `AcquireImage` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Memory is allocated but not freed, leading to resource exhaustion over time.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can lead to increased memory usage and eventually system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted image file.
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) shows a command using `convert` with a specific image file (`Memory-Leak-13_output_picon_1501390784.98`) that causes the memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file to be processed by ImageMagick.
- The attacker would need the ability to execute the `convert` command, which could be done locally or through an application that uses ImageMagick.
