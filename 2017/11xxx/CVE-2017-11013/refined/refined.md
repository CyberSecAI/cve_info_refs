```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap buffer overflow in the WLAN driver due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the received data. Specifically a large value for the length field in a received frame is not checked against the size of the buffer used to store the data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap buffer overflow",
     "Integer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted file (WLAN frame) to trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send WLAN packets to the vulnerable device."
