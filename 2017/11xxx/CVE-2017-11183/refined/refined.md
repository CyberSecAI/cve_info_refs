Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11183:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `front/backup.php` file of GLPI. This file allows for the deletion of arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary file deletion:** The `front/backup.php` script does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input in the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file on the server for deletion.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** Successful exploitation can lead to the deletion of arbitrary files, potentially causing data loss, disruption of service, or complete compromise of the system.
*   **System Instability:** Deletion of critical system files could cause the application and possibly the underlying operating system to become unstable.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network through HTTP requests to the affected `front/backup.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, exploiting the vulnerability over the network.
*   **Authenticated administrator:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges within the GLPI application.
