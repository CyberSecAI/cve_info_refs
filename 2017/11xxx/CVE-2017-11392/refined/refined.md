Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-11392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `modTMCSS Proxy` functionality of Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security.
*   The system fails to properly validate a user-supplied string in the "T" parameter before using it in a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The lack of input validation on the "T" parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The injected code executes under the context of the `imss` user, which means that the attacker could potentially escalate to gain more control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it over the network.
*   **Specific parameter:** The attack is triggered by manipulating the "T" parameter during the processing of the `modTMCSS Proxy` functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-privileged access:**  The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This suggests that an attacker needs some level of initial access to the system to exploit the vulnerability. This could be by compromising an account or exploiting a different vulnerability.
