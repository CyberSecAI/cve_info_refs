The provided content relates to CVE-2017-11555.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An illegal address access occurs in the `eval.cpp` file of the libsass library. This is due to an issue within the Sass::Eval::operator() function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Segmentation fault due to illegal memory access.
- The vulnerability lies within the evaluation of Sass code where a pointer dereference leads to an invalid memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to program crash (segmentation fault).

**Attack vectors:**
- By processing a specially crafted Sass file using the `sassc` tool, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- The provided information includes a "POC" (Proof of Concept) that triggers the crash using the command `./sassc $POC`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious Sass file as input to the `sassc` tool.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned. The attack can be triggered through normal usage of the tool.
