The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in FiyoCMS. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in various PHP files. Several `$_POST` and `$_GET` parameters are directly injected into SQL queries without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is SQL injection. Attackers can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters.
*   **Unfiltered Input:**  The vulnerability arises from the failure to sanitize or escape user-provided data before including it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can use stacked queries to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This could allow them to read, modify, or delete data, or even compromise the entire system.
*   **Data Breaches:**  Sensitive data could be accessed and stolen.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers may gain control of the database server and potentially the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are primarily HTTP requests, using GET and POST methods. The following paths were mentioned as vulnerable:

1.  `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php` (POST)
2.  `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php` (POST)
3.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php` (GET)
4.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php` (GET)
5.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php` (GET)
6.  `/dapur/apps/app_article/sys_article.php` (POST, during category, article add/edit)
7.  `/dapur/apps/app_comment/controller/comment_status.php` (GET)
8.  `/dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php` (POST and REQUEST, during comment edit, enable/disable).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. This means they could be an unauthenticated user or a logged-in user, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   No special position is required other than the ability to access the web server where the vulnerable application is deployed.

**Detailed Description of Vulnerable Parameters:**

The following parameters are explicitly mentioned as vulnerable:

*   `$_POST['id']` and `$_POST['art_title']` in `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php`
*   `$_POST` parameters in `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php` (specifically, `send`, `name`, `email`, `url`, `text`)
*   `$_GET[cat]`, `$_GET[user]`, `$_GET[level]`, and `$_GET['iSortCol'.$i]` in `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php`
*   `$_GET['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php`
*   `$_GET['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php`
*   `$_POST[parent_id]`, `$_POST[desc]`, `$_POST[keys]`, and `$_POST[level]` in `/dapur/apps/app_article/sys_article.php` (and other params during add/edit article operations)
*   `$_GET['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_comment/controller/comment_status.php`
*   `$_POST[comment]`, `$_POST[name]`, `$_POST[web]`, `$_POST[email]`, `$_POST[status]`, `$_POST[id]` in `/dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php` (during edit comment)
*   `$_REQUEST['id']` in `/dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php` (during enable/disable comment).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content explicitly mentions the use of PDO for database interaction which, when used correctly, can mitigate SQL injection. However, in this case, the parameters are not being properly bound, which negates any benefit.
*   The report indicates that many attack vectors are available due to widespread lack of input filtering.
