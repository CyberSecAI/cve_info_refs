- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Android app does not implement certificate pinning. Instead, it only checks the signature of the Certificate Authority.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of certificate pinning.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This vulnerability makes man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks easier. An attacker could intercept and potentially modify encrypted communications.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned between the client and the server to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
