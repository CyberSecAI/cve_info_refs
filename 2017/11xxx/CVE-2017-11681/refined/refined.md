The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Hashtopussy 0.4.0, and it aligns with CVE-2017-11681.

Here's a breakdown of each vulnerability:

**1. CSRF (Admin Password Change):**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection on the admin password change form.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trick an authenticated admin user into changing their password without their consent.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious website or email containing a crafted form that targets the vulnerable password change endpoint.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an admin into visiting their crafted page while the admin is logged into Hashtopussy.

**2. Weak ACL:**
*   **Root Cause:** Improper access control configuration.
*   **Vulnerability:** Inadequate access control allows users with a normal role to perform actions intended for administrators.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized users can add/delete vouchers, add new agents, create/delete hashcat releases.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a valid user session.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user session.

**3. Stored XSS (Readable by any user or role):**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization when creating a new Hashcat Release.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript code can be injected and executed when users view the Hashcat release, potentially leading to privilege escalation if executed by an admin.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the "Weak ACL" vulnerability to create a new hashcat release with malicious JavaScript in the version, url, or rootdir parameters.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user session, leveraging weak ACL to access the hashcat release functionality.

**4. Open Redirect:**
*  **Root Cause:** Unvalidated redirect URL during the login process.
*  **Vulnerability:** Open redirect.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website after a successful login, potentially for phishing or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a login request with a malicious `fw` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires valid user credentials.

**5. Reflective XSS (Affecting only authenticated users):**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization on the `hashes.php` page.
*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with JavaScript in the `display` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a user to click on the malicious URL while logged in to the application.

**6. Stored XSS (Only Affecting User's Session):**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization when creating a new notification.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed within the session of the user who created the malicious notification.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a POST request to the notifications endpoint with malicious JavaScript in the `receiver` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user session.
