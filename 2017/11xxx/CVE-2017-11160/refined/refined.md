- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in the installer of Synology Assistant.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL hijacking vulnerability. The installer searches for required DLLs in the current working directory, which allows an attacker to place malicious DLLs with the same name in that directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by placing a Trojan horse DLL (shfolder.dll, ntmarta.dll, secur32.dll, or dwmapi.dll) in the same directory where the Synology Assistant installer is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to place a malicious DLL file in the directory where the Synology Assistant installer is run. The user also needs to run the installer.
