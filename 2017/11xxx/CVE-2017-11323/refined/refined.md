```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A stack buffer overflow occurs in ALZip 8.51 when processing a specially crafted "DosDevice" file during file compression.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack buffer overflow and file creation vulnerabilities.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation occurs when a user attempts to compress a malicious file (crafted DosDevice file) using ALZip. Specifically, right-clicking the file and using ALZip to compress it triggers the vulnerability.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to create a file with a name like "AUX.3.2.1.e.pwned" on the victim's system. This can be done with normal user CMD using the syntax provided. The user must then right-click this file and try to compress it using ALZip for the exploit to succeed.
