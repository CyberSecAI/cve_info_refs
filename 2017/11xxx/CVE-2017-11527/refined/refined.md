  "CVE-2017-11527": {
    "Description": "A memory exhaustion vulnerability exists in the ReadDPXImage function in coders/dpx.c in ImageMagick. When processing a DPX file containing user header data, ImageMagick allocates memory based on a size read from the file. This size, `dpx.file.user_size`, is read from the file and used in `BlobToStringInfo` call without proper validation or prior to the security check `SetImageExtent`. An attacker can exploit this by providing a crafted DPX file with a large `user_size`, leading to excessive memory allocation and potentially causing a denial-of-service.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation on the `dpx.file.user_size` value read from the DPX file, which is directly used to allocate memory in `BlobToStringInfo`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unvalidated input used for memory allocation",
      "Insufficient bounds checking",
      "Memory exhaustion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory exhaustion, leading to denial of service. The program may become unresponsive or crash due to excessive memory usage.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted DPX image file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted DPX file to an application that utilizes ImageMagick."
