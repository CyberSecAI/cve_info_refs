# MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded database credentials

---

*From*: Allen F <afranks2131 () gmail com>

```
Overview
------------

MEDHOST Connex for all versions contains hard-coded credentials that are
used for customer
database access. This is a new vulnerability not related to CVE-2016-4328.

Description
------------

MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded credentials that are used for customer
database
access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and the
ability
to communicate directly with the database may be able to obtain
or modify sensitive patient and financial information.

Connex utilizes an IBM i DB2 user account for database access. The account
name is HMSCXPDN.
This password is hard-coded in multiple places of the application.
Customers do not have the option to change this password. The account has
elevated DB2 roles, and can access all objects or database tables on the
customer DB2 database. This account can access data through odbc, ftp, and
telnet.

Customers w/o Connex installed are still vulnerable. The MEDHOST setup
program creates this account. Connex provides connectivity to exchange
clinical information with the MEDHOST application. /1

Impact
------------

An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and the ability to
communicate
directly with the application database server may be able to obtain or
modify patient
and financial information.

Solution
------------

The vendor has not issued a patch and has been unresponsive to this
information after 3 attempts
to communicate.

Restrict network access

As a general security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts
and networks.
Restricting access would prevent an attacker from using the hard-coded
database credentials
from a blocked network location.
