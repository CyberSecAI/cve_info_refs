The provided content describes a vulnerability in MEDHOST Connex, which is a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-4328.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Hard-coded database credentials are used for customer database access in MEDHOST Connex.
- The IBM i DB2 user account `HMSCXPDN` has a hard-coded password within the application and customers cannot change it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hard-coded credentials
- Inability for users to change the hardcoded password
- Overly permissive database access roles granted to the account (access to all objects/tables in the customer's DB2 database)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and direct communication with the database can obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial information.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can directly communicate with the database via ODBC, FTP, and Telnet using the hardcoded credentials

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Knowledge of the hard-coded credentials ( `HMSCXPDN` user and password).
- Ability to communicate directly with the application database server.
