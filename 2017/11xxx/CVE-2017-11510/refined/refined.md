Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information leak within the ONVIF implementation of the Wanscam HW0021 network camera. Specifically, the `GetSnapshotUri` method, intended to return a URL for the most recent camera snapshot, inadvertently includes the administrator's username and password within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information (admin username and password) through the ONVIF protocol's `GetSnapshotUri` response.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated remote attackers.
- **Insecure URL Construction:** The camera constructs the snapshot URL with the username and password included as cleartext parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** An attacker can obtain the administrator's username and password, granting them full control over the camera.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Once compromised, the attacker can access the camera feed, modify settings, or potentially use it as a launching point for further network attacks.
- **Privacy Violation:** The unauthorized access and potential misuse of the camera can have significant privacy implications for the camera's owner/operator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Request:** The attack is initiated by sending an ONVIF `GetSnapshotUri` request to the vulnerable camera over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The request can be sent by any user on the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the camera, as the vulnerability is exposed through the network services.
- **Basic Knowledge of ONVIF:** Knowledge of the ONVIF protocol, specifically the `GetSnapshotUri` method, is required to craft the malicious request.
