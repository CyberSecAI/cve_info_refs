```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack buffer overflow in the GCore server (GCoreServer.exe).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow, which allows an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, including the return address, and gain control of the program's execution flow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary remote code execution on the target system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request sent to the vulnerable web server on port 13003 or 13004.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the target server. No authentication is required.
