# Security Advisory 2017-07-12

## Improper Restriction in phpMyFAQ

 Issued on: 2017-07-12 Software: phpMyFAQ <= 2.9.7 Risk: Medium Platforms: all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that have been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.9.6 and earlier. phpMyFAQ has an improper account-lockout setting, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack.

## Description

phpMyFAQ does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within in a short time frame, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks. An attacker could perform an arbitrary number of authentication attempts using different passwords, and eventually gain access to the targeted account.

## Solution

The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 2.9.8 which fix the vulnerability. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround

There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.9.8.
