Package        : sox
Version        : 14.4.1-5+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11332 CVE-2017-11358 CVE-2017-11359 CVE-2017-15371
Debian Bug     : 878809 870328

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SoX (Sound eXchange),
a sound processing program:

CVE-2017-11332

    The startread function (wav.c) is affected by a divide-by-zero
    vulnerability when processing WAV file with zero channel count. This
    flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a crafted WAV file
    to perform denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-11358

    The read_samples function (hcom.c) is affected by an invalid memory read
    vulnerability when processing HCOM files with invalid dictionnaries. This
    flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a crafted HCOM file to
    perform denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-11359

    The wavwritehdr function (wav.c) is affected by a divide-by-zero
    vulnerability when processing WAV files with invalid channel count over
    16 bits. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a crafted
    WAV file to perform denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-15371

    The sox_append_comment() function (formats.c) is vulnerable to a reachable
    assertion when processing FLAC files with metadata declaring more comments
    than provided. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using
    crafted FLAC data to perform denial of service (application crash).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
14.4.1-5+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.

I did a (too) rough survey of the upstream repository and (too quickly)
concluded that it wouldn't help me with fixing these in Debian, so I
worked from Debian's fork. I should have made this more clear.

Still needed in git.

I'll be replacing the Debian-specific, broken fix of CVE-2017-11358 with
the one committed upstream. Thanks.

>   04-fix-hcom-big-endian.patch#

Indeed, I should have revisited the upstream tree. Upstream also fixes a
double free and I'll be replacing my patch with the upstream one.

>   06-CVE-2021-33844.patch

The code is refactored, but I think the issue persists in wav_read_fmt
where wav->bitsPerSample isn't checked.

> and

The hunk context changed and channels are now verified, but the size
validation is still missing. During further analysis I also found that
my patch is insufficient still.

If uc becomes 1, we assign it to v->size, later we pass 6 - v->size as
the second parameter to lsx_adpcm_init, which is used as an index into a
static array of 5 elements. We thus have an out-of-bounds read access
here. I don't yet know where exactly the check belongs as v->size == 1
may be valid in some contexts still.

Updated patch attached.

Thank you.

I think it would be good to have a maintained upstream repository of sox
eventually. It seems like multiple distributions are maintaining
diverging patch piles now.

Would be very nice, i use it almost daily for over twenty years.
(But .. mostly for playing sounds, i am not a sophisticated sound
engineer etc etc.)

Wonderful, thank you very much for the additional work, i first
thought hcom would now miss the INT32 max check, but that was also
upstream.  (Thanks, i really have _zero_ idea of the code.)

I hope it is ok, i still port [master], but now with the
additional patch as attached, that has your name on it.

Ciao!

Sound eXchange (SoX) multiple vulnerabilities
================
Author : qflb.wu
===============

Introduction:
=============
SoX is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc.) command line utility that can convert various formats of
computer audio files in to other formats. It can also apply various effects to these sound files, and, as an added
bonus, SoX can play and record audio files on most platforms.

Affected version:
=====
14.4.2

Vulnerability Description:
==========================
1.
the startread function in wav.c in Sound eXchange(SoX) 14.4.2 can cause a denial of service(divide-by-zero error and
application crash) via a crafted wav file.

./sox sox_14.4.2_divide_by_zero_error_1.wav out.ogg

Message-ID: <Y91yP6mYIZ+UXmgf@alf.mars>

Subject: sox: patches for old vulnerabilities

Hi,

I am working on fixing known vulnerabilities in sox and since upstream
seems mostly dead (no commits in more than a year, no replies to bug
reports), I am posting my results here. My work on sox is compensated by
Freexian SARL.

I located two distinct memory leaks.

The fix for CVE-2017-11358 introduced a regression. Reading any hcom
file would result in an error. This made the test suite fail, but since
nobody seems to run the test suite, this ended up being shipped in e.g.
multiple Debian releases.

On 64bit big endian systems, a 64bit integer is incorrectly truncated to
the upper 32bits. This subsequently causes an assertion failure or a
stack overflow in a -DNDEBUG build. This issue also breaks the test
suite. I do not think that this is exploitable and do not intend to
request a CVE.

I'm attaching patches for these as well as patches for the following
vulnerabilities:
 * CVE-2021-3643 and CVE-2021-23210
 * CVE-2021-23159 and CVE-2021-23172
 * CVE-2021-33844
 * CVE-2021-40426
 * CVE-2022-31650
 * CVE-2022-31651

I welcome reviews and propose adding these patches to distributions that
ship sox. I will upload these patches to Debian.

Please Cc me in replies.

Helmut

Debian Bug     : 870328 878810 878809 878808 882236 882144

Various security vulnerabilities were discovered in sox, a command
line utility to convert audio formats, that may lead to a
denial-of-service (application crash / infinite loop) or memory
corruptions by processing a malformed input file.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
14.4.0-3+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.

Thank you for this work on sox!
But i was only wondering a bit, have you checked against the
[master] branch?  For example

  02-fix-resource-leak-hcom.patch
  03-fix-regression-in-CVE-2017-11358.patch
  04-fix-hcom-big-endian.patch#
  06-CVE-2021-33844.patch
and
  07-CVE-2021-3643.patch

do not apply against it, and he introduced functions like
dictvalid() to do things you seem to unroll differently?

The rest just apply fine, and 02- was needed here, 03- seemed an
unrolled dup, 04- in parts (stdint via sox.h, but overflow, sure),
it is too late to check the rest, 'will do tomorrow.
(I an maintaining an official contrib now private sox port for
CRUX Linux based upon 42b3557e13e0fe0 as of 20211029.)

Ciao!

Sound eXchange (SoX) multiple vulnerabilities
================
Author : qflb.wu
===============

Introduction:
=============
SoX is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc.) command line utility that can convert various formats of computer audio files in to other formats. It can also apply various effects to these sound files, and, as an added bonus, SoX can play and record audio files on most platforms.

Affected version:
=====
14.4.2

Vulnerability Description:
==========================
1.
the startread function in wav.c in Sound eXchange(SoX) 14.4.2 can cause a denial of service(divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted wav file.

./sox sox_14.4.2_divide_by_zero_error_1.wav out.ogg

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
