  "CVE-2017-11473": {
    "description": "The `mp_override_legacy_irq` function in `arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c` in the Linux kernel through 4.12.2 allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted ACPI table.",
    "root_cause": "The `bus_irq` argument of `mp_override_legacy_irq()` is used as an index into the `isa_irq_to_gsi[]` array without proper bounds checking. This argument originates from ACPI tables (`ACPI_MADT_TYPE_IO_APIC` and `ACPI_MADT_TYPE_INTERRUPT` items) which are not always trustworthy.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could use a specially crafted ACPI table to overwrite memory, potentially leading to system malfunction, panic, arbitrary code execution, or privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local Access",
      "Malicious ACPI Table"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to write to ACPI tables",
      "Ability to reboot the system",
       "ACPI table changes persist through reboots (not common in cloud/serverless environments)"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2018:0654) includes a fix for this vulnerability, and it is rated with 'Low' severity.  The fix involves adding a sanity check for the `bus_irq` value to prevent out-of-bounds access."
