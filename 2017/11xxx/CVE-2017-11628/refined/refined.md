  "CVE-2017-11628": {
    "description": "A stack buffer overflow exists in the latest stable release of PHP-7.1.5 and PHP-5.6.30 in PHP INI parsing API. On malformed inputs, a stack buffer overflow in `zend_ini_do_op()` could write 1-byte off a fixed size stack buffer. On installations with the stack smashing mitigation, this would cause an immediate DoS; up to optimization levels, build options, and stack buffer overflow mitigations, this vulnerability may allow corrupting other local variables or the frame pointer, potentially allowing remotely executing code.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of integer to string conversion in `zend_ini_do_op()` function while processing INI files or strings leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking.",
       "Integer to string conversion with a fixed size buffer."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, corruption of local variables, frame pointer corruption or potentially allow remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted INI entry via file or string.",
      "Parsing a crafted .ini file or string through `parse_ini_file()` or `parse_ini_string()`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input to the `parse_ini_file()` or `parse_ini_string()` functions. This may be a local file or string or a file provided remotely."
