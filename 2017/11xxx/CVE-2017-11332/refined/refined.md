Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-11332:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a divide-by-zero error in the `startread` function within the `wav.c` file. This occurs when processing a crafted WAV file with a zero channel count.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Divide-by-zero error.
- Lack of proper input validation when handling the number of channels in a WAV file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - the application crashes due to the divide-by-zero error.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted WAV file with a zero channel count as input to the SoX utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted audio file as input to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker can be local or remote, as long as they can make the application process their malicious file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `startread` function at `wav.c:950` in the source code, where the number of samples is calculated by dividing by the number of channels.
- The provided debugging information confirms that the `rcx` register, which holds the divisor, contains zero, leading to the crash.
- The vulnerability is present in SoX version 14.4.2.
