Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-11335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `tiff2pdf` tool.
*   The overflow occurs during the processing of TIFF images with "Raw" mode and PlanarConfig=Contig setting
*   The root cause is related to incorrect handling of memory allocation/copying when processing certain TIFF images in `tiff2pdf`.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the tool attempts to decode ZIP-compressed data, and the `inflate` function writes beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** This allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, potentially corrupting other heap data.
*   **Incorrect size calculation:** The issue stems from a flaw in how the size of the buffer is determined or how the `inflate` function operates within the context of `tiff2pdf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash of the `tiff2pdf` application leads to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow could be exploited by a skilled attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the `tiff2pdf` tool, though not explicitly confirmed in the provided content but mentioned in the Ubuntu Security Notice.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted TIFF file:** A malicious attacker creates a TIFF file designed to trigger the overflow vulnerability when opened with `tiff2pdf`.
*   The `tiff2pdf` utility is the target of the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF file to be processed by the vulnerable `tiff2pdf` tool.
*   This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening such a file or by having an automated system process such files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report mentions that the overflow occurred in the `ZIPDecode` function within libtiff, specifically during the inflate operation (`inflate(&sp->stream, Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH)`). However, the fix was applied in `tools/tiff2pdf.c`. This suggests the vulnerability is triggered via a libtiff function call from within tiff2pdf.
*   The issue was reproducible in versions 4.0.7, 4.0.8, and CVS at the time it was discovered.
*   The fix was implemented in `tools/tiff2pdf.c` to prevent the heap overflow when processing TIFF images with specific configurations.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA) indicates that this CVE is one of multiple vulnerabilities fixed in their security updates for the `tiff` package.
*   Ubuntu also issued a security notice (USN-3602-1) addressing this and other libtiff vulnerabilities and mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution.
