{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain image files by GraphicsMagick.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code does not properly check if the input image is colormapped before attempting to write it, which leads to a null pointer dereference.",
      "Insufficient checks on the input image data, leading to potential for denial-of-service or other unspecified impacts."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified impacts by providing malformed image files.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a specially malformed image file and processing it using GraphicsMagick.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted image file to be processed by GraphicsMagick.",
        "additional_details": "The specific issue was a null pointer dereference or SEGV in the MAP writer when the input image was not already colormapped. This was resolved by allocating memory and checking image type before operations.",
    "affected_component": "coders/map.c (WriteMAPImage) of GraphicsMagick",
    "affected_versions": "Versions prior to 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.3 on Ubuntu 16.04, prior to 1.3.30+hg15796-1~deb9u1 on Debian stretch, and prior to 1.3.32 on Fedora 30."
