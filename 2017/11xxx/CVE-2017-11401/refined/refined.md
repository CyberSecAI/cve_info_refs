Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-11401:

**Root Cause:**

- Improper handling of the `mbap.length` field within Modbus packets by the Modbus DPI filter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The Modbus DPI filter does not correctly validate the `mbap.length` field. This allows crafted packets with unexpected lengths to bypass the intended filtering logic based on function codes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can send malformed or crafted Modbus packets to a protected asset, bypassing the Modbus function code filtering that the firewall is intended to provide. This can potentially lead to unauthorized actions on the protected device depending on the crafted Modbus payload.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP or TCP packets to a protected asset on the local network (LAN).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have network access to the protected LAN segment where the affected device is located.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send Modbus packets.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon Security Appliance firmware versions 3.10 and earlier.
- The vulnerability specifically affects the Modbus enforcer DPI filter.
- The provided Belden Security Bulletin (BSECV-2017-14) confirms the details of the vulnerability and the recommended fix (upgrade to version 03.2.00).
