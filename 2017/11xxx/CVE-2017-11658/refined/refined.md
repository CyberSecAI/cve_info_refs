  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the HTTP_HOST header in `process.php` and `config.php`. The `$host` variable, which is directly derived from the `HTTP_HOST` header, is used to construct file paths that are included in the application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server through LFI by manipulating the `HTTP_HOST` header. This could lead to the execution of malicious code or disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the HTTP_HOST header in a crafted HTTP request."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a modified `HTTP_HOST` header to the vulnerable server."
  },
  "summary": "The provided text describes a vulnerability in the WP-Rocket WordPress plugin that can be exploited via a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The issue exists due to insufficient sanitization of the HTTP_HOST header when constructing file paths for inclusion in `process.php` and `config.php`. A bypass to a previous patch is also described using a null byte in the payload."
