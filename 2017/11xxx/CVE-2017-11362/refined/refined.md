{
  "CVE-2017-11362": {
    "Description": "In PHP 7.x before 7.0.21 and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, ext/intl/msgformat/msgformat_parse.c does not restrict the locale length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact within International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ via a long first argument to the msgfmt_parse_message function.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `msgfmt_parse_message` function within the PHP Internationalization extension, where the length of the locale parameter is not validated before being passed to the underlying ICU library's `umsg_open` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of input validation on locale length."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application due to the stack buffer overflow. Unspecified other impacts within ICU are also possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing an overly long locale string as the first argument to the `msgfmt_parse_message` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted input with a very long locale parameter to the `msgfmt_parse_message` function, so no specific position is needed."
  }
