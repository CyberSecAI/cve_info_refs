The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the FiyoCMS application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization/filtering of user-supplied data within the tag add/edit functionality. Specifically, the `$_POST['name']` parameter, which is used to create or update tags is not properly escaped before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability: Malicious SQL code can be injected through the `name` parameter when adding or editing article tags.
- Lack of input sanitization: The code uses `striptags()` which removes HTML tags but does not prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL query execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete compromise of the application and its underlying infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/fiyo/dapur/index.php?app=article&view=tag&act=edit&id=79` or the tag add function with a malicious payload in the `name` parameter.
-  The provided example attack vector includes `name=1%22or%221` within the POST data, highlighting a specific injection attempt.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have an account on the FiyoCMS to access the tag add/edit functionality, as indicated by "We need a account to do this thing".
