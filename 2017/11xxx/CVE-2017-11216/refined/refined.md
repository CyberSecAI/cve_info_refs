Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-11216:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Acrobat Pro DC parses EMF (Enhanced Metafile) images.
*   Specifically, a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during EMF parsing can lead to writing past the end of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient input validation in EMF parsing.
*   Memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   Potential for an attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
*   User interaction is required. This involves a target user visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted EMF image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious EMF file or host a webpage that triggers the vulnerable code path in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC when a victim interacts with it.
*   The attacker needs to induce the victim to open the malicious file or webpage.
