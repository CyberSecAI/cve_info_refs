{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-11525",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ReadCINImage` function within `coders/cin.c`. When processing CIN files with user-defined data, the function allocates memory using `BlobToStringInfo` based on the `user_length` read from the file. This allocation happens before a proper size check, specifically before the call to `SetImageExtent`. Consequently, an attacker can control the `user_length` value, leading to excessive memory allocation and potential memory exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory exhaustion due to unchecked allocation size",
       "Lack of input validation before memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting the system's memory, making the service unresponsive.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted CIN file with a large value for `user_length` can be used to trigger the memory exhaustion vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted CIN file to be processed by ImageMagick. The attacker does not need to be local, as the file could be supplied via a web server for instance."
  },
   "additional_details": "The report includes a proof of concept (PoC) file and a demonstration of the memory exhaustion using the `top` command to monitor the memory usage of the `magick` process. The `policy.xml` was bypassed, which was meant to limit memory usage. The issue also affects multiple versions of ImageMagick including older versions such as `6.7.7.10-5` and `6.8.9.9-5`, as well as newer versions such as `7.0.6-1`."
