  "cveId": "CVE-2017-11394",
  "description": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro OfficeScan. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Web Console, which listens on TCP port 4343 by default. When parsing the T parameter in Proxy.php, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current service.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Improper validation of user-supplied input in the 'T' parameter within Proxy.php.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Authentication Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server user.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `Proxy.php` file."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the OfficeScan web interface. Authentication is required to reach the vulnerable endpoint, but this can be bypassed by exploiting another vulnerability.",
     "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is located in the web console, specifically the `Proxy.php` file. The vulnerability can be exploited using a crafted POST request. The authentication bypass vulnerability is located in the widget feature implemented with PHP in 'talker.php'. The product's default web console listens on TCP port 4343. However the exploit mentions port 443 as well, due to the fact it is leveraging the secure connection. An authentication bypass using 'talker.php' allows access to widget features and then a command injection vulnerability in 'Proxy.php' leads to remote code execution"
