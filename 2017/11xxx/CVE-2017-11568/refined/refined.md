Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11568:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3958-1 explicitly lists CVE-2017-11568 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the `fontforge` package update.
   - The GitHub issue #3089 title, "heap buffer overflow in PSCharStringToSplines (psread.c)", aligns with the vulnerability described in the Debian advisory, confirming its relevance to CVE-2017-11568.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a heap buffer overflow within the `PSCharStringToSplines` function located in `psread.c`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists.
   - The `PSCharStringToSplines` function in `psread.c` does not properly validate input, leading to the overflow.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial-of-Service:** Exploitation leads to a crash of the `fontforge` application.
   - **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution, although the provided information primarily demonstrates a crash.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector involves a maliciously crafted OpenType font file.
   - An attacker can trick a user into opening the malicious font file using `fontforge`, triggering the vulnerability.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - The attacker needs to create a specially crafted OpenType font file designed to trigger the buffer overflow in `PSCharStringToSplines`.
   - The attacker needs to convince a user to open this malicious file with `fontforge`. This could be done via social engineering, email attachments, malicious websites etc.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `PSCharStringToSplines` function of the `fontforge` software. It can be triggered by opening a malicious OpenType font file. This could result in a denial of service due to application crash or potentially arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to craft a specific malicious font file and then trick a user into opening it to exploit the flaw.
