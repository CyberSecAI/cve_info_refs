- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `finderd` daemon of the D-Link EyeOn Baby Monitor (DCS-825L).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when processing crafted UDP packets. Specifically, an attacker can send a malicious UDP request that overflows a buffer on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending specially crafted UDP packets to the affected device. The `finderd` daemon listens for these packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the device. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to craft a UDP request that triggers the stack overflow, and use Return Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques.
