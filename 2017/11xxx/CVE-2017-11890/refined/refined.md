The provided content relates to CVE-2017-11890.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in `RegExpBase::EnsureSpace` when handling the desired buffer size, leading to insufficient memory allocation for regular expression compilation in jscript.dll. Specifically, the integer overflow happens in the caller of `RegExpBase::EnsureSpace` when calculating the desired size to append to the existing buffer content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow vulnerability due to insufficient buffer allocation.
- Integer overflow when calculating buffer size within the regular expression compilation process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to access violation caused by memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is controlled precisely.

**Attack vectors:**
- By posing as a WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) host and sending a malicious `wpad.dat` file, which is parsed as Javascript by `jscript.dll`, to the victim.
- By opening a malicious web page in Internet Explorer that executes the vulnerable JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For WPAD exploitation: attacker needs to be on the local network and capable of acting as a WPAD server.
- For Internet Explorer exploitation: attacker needs to host a malicious web page that can be accessed by the victim.
- The attacker does not need specific user credentials or elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker gains the privileges of the WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Service or the Internet Explorer tab process, depending on the exploitation method.
