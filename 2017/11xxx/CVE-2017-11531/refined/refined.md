- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The issue is a memory leak in the `WriteHISTOGRAMImage` function within `coders/histogram.c`. Specifically, memory allocated within the `CloneBlobInfo` and `AcquireImage` functions is not being freed when writing a histogram image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeated triggering of the vulnerable code can lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file using the `convert` utility in ImageMagick, specifically when writing an output histogram image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide an image to be processed by ImageMagick, which is often achievable when ImageMagick is used to process user-supplied images, and control the output format to trigger the affected code path.
