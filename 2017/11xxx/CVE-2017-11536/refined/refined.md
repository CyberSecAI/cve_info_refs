The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11536.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `WriteJP2Image()` function within the `coders/jp2.c` file of ImageMagick. This leak happens due to an allocation made using `ConstantString` which is not freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The allocated memory is not properly released.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing the application to crash or become unstable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted image file in JP2 format using the `convert` utility of ImageMagick.
- An attacker can provide a malicious JP2 file to an application using the vulnerable ImageMagick library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted JP2 file to be processed by the vulnerable application.
- No specific user privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
- The memory leak occurs specifically on line 920 of `coders/jp2.c`.
- The leak is detected using AddressSanitizer, indicating the presence of memory corruption.
- The amount of leaked memory in the provided example is 22 bytes.
- A proof-of-concept file is provided (`memory-leak_output_jp2_WriteJP2Image`).
