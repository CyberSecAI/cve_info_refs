Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `parseSWF_SHAPEWITHSTYLE` function within the `parser.c` file of the libming library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The `parseSWF_SHAPEWITHSTYLE` function allocates memory but fails to free it under certain conditions, leading to a memory leak. This happens in multiple areas of the code as shown by the stack trace. The leak occurs when parsing a crafted SWF file.
- There are multiple direct and indirect memory leaks. Indirect leaks are caused by `parseSWF_END`, `parseSWF_SHOWFRAME`, and `parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT2` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted SWF file, causing the server or application processing this file to continuously leak memory. This eventually leads to resource exhaustion and DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted SWF File:** The primary attack vector is a malicious or specially crafted SWF file designed to trigger the memory leak in `parseSWF_SHAPEWITHSTYLE`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious SWF file to the application or server using the vulnerable libming library. This could be through uploading, processing user-supplied content, or any other means where the library is used to handle SWF files.

**Additional Details:**
- The blog post and the github issue provide the same details.
- The github issue includes a test case and a full report of the multiple memory leaks.
- The github issue indicates the vulnerability was found by the ADLab of Venustech.
- The vulnerable code is in the `util/parser.c` file.
- The libming library is used for generating Macromedia Flash files (.swf) and includes tools for working with these files.
- The memory leak occurs during the parsing of the SWF file by the `listswf` utility.
