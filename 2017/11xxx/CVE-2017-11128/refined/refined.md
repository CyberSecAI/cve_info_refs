Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Bolt CMS 3.2.14:

**Vulnerability 1: XSS through SVG File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** The CMS allows uploading SVG files without properly checking their content.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization and content inspection of uploaded SVG files. The application fails to recognize JavaScript code embedded within an SVG file, due to the `Content-Type: image/svg+xml` header, thus considering it a safe image file.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code, which will then execute when the file is viewed by other users in the CMS context.
*  **Attack Vector:** Uploading a crafted SVG file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Authenticated user capable of uploading files.

**Vulnerability 2: Stored XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** The CMS does not properly validate or sanitize user input.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the CMS database.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code that is stored permanently and executes whenever a user views the affected content.
*   **Attack Vector:** Inserting malicious JavaScript code through input fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Authenticated user capable of entering data into the CMS.
