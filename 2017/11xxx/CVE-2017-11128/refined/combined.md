**XSS through SVG File Upload Vulnerability:**

**Authentication**: Required

**Description:**

CMS allows upload of SVG file without checking the content of it.So If we upload SVG file
containing JavaScript code in it then the CMS fails to check the content of it
because the "Content-Type: image/svg+xml" header will make this attack
works as it fails to recognize that uploaded SVG file has JS contents.

Please check out the video for more info.

==============================================================

**Stored XSS Vulnerability:**

**Authentication**: Required

**Description:**

Bolt CMS is not properly validating and sanitizing the user input.By taking an advantage of this loophole an attacker is able to insert malicious the JavaScript and able to store it permanently into the website.
Please check out the video for more info.

Note:The vendor of this CMS has not accepted these vulnerabilities.
