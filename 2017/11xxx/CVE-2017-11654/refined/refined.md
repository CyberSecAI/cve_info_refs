The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the `sipcrack` software package. Specifically, it focuses on CVE-2017-11654 which is one of the two CVEs discussed.

**CVE-2017-11654**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `sniff_logins` function within `SIPdump.c`. Specifically, there is an out-of-bounds write due to incorrect calculation of payload size and an off-by-one error when null terminating the payload. Furthermore, the code attempts to write to a `const` memory location and performs out-of-bounds memory reads.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Heap-buffer-overflow (out-of-bounds write) due to incorrect payload size and off-by-one error when null-terminating.
    *   Out-of-bounds memory read.
    *   Incorrect usage of `const` pointer.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can trigger a crash of the `sipdump` process (denial of service) by sending specially crafted SIP traffic, leading to the program's abnormal termination.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Network:** By sending crafted network traffic to a vulnerable `sipdump` instance running in live capture mode (`-i` option).
    *   **Local:** By opening a specially crafted `.pcap` file with the `-p` option.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the machine running the vulnerable `sipdump` application or have access to the local file system where the machine is running `sipdump` and can make use of a malicious `.pcap` file.
