```
{
  "CVE-2017-11802": {
    "Root cause": "The 'String.prototype.replace' method can be inlined in the JIT process. However, 'RegexHelper::StringReplace' calls the replace function without updating the 'ImplicitCallFlags'. This prevents the detection of user function calls, leading to potential type confusion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of 'ImplicitCallFlags' during JIT inlining of 'String.prototype.replace'",
      "Type confusion vulnerability due to incorrect call flag management"
    ],
    "Impact": "Type confusion, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By exploiting the JIT compilation behavior of the Chakra engine in Microsoft Edge through a specially crafted javascript payload.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to deliver javascript to the victim, such as by hosting a malicious website.  No special privileges are needed."
