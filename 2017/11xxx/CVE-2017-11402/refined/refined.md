Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Design flaws in the combination of the OPC Classic DPI filter and custom netfilter modules within the Tofino Xenon Security Appliance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The OPC Enforcer can be manipulated by crafting a false OPC dynamic port shift.
- This manipulation triggers the insertion of a new firewall rule.
- The newly inserted rule allows an attacker-controlled TCP session with a fixed source port to bypass the firewall.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the Tofino firewall.
- The attacker can establish a TCP connection to any port of a protected asset.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must connect to the protected asset using the OPC Classic port.
- Once connected, the attacker sends specially crafted OPC messages to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the OPC Classic port of a protected asset.
- The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft OPC messages to trigger the firewall rule insertion.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected product is the Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon Security Appliance, versions 3.10 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Julien Lenoir of Airbus CERT Team.
- The fix is included in version 03.2.00 of the Tofino Xenon firmware.
