Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds access occurs in the DNxHD decoder due to insufficient checks on the macroblock height (`mb_height`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** The vulnerability arises from accessing memory outside of the intended boundaries. Specifically, the `data_offset` calculation uses `mb_height` without proper validation, potentially resulting in out-of-bounds reads or writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the FFmpeg application, causing a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** As mentioned in the Debian Security Advisory, in some situations, this out-of-bounds access could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, though this is not explicitly detailed in the provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted DNxHD File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted DNxHD file that contains a malicious `mb_height` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted DNxHD file to FFmpeg to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit logs show a fix for "out of array access" and "poc.dnxhd" which indicates that there was an attempt to trigger the issue with a proof-of-concept.
- The fix involves moving the `mb_height` check out of the non-HR (high resolution) branch and ensuring that the check is applied before `data_offset` calculation which helps prevent out of bounds access.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3957-1 confirms that CVE-2017-11719 is an out-of-bound access that can be triggered by a crafted DNxHD file. It also highlights that exploitation could lead to DoS and potentially arbitrary code execution.
