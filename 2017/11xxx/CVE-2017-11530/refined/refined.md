Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11530:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory exhaustion issue within the `ReadEPTImage` function in `ept.c` of ImageMagick.
- The function allocates memory based on two length fields (`ept_info.postscript_length` and `ept_info.tiff_length`) read directly from the input EPT file. These lengths are not checked against reasonable values, leading to potentially huge allocations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The `AcquireQuantumMemory` function is called with sizes derived from the potentially attacker-controlled length fields without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code directly uses the lengths read from the EPT file without checking if they exceed reasonable limits or are within the constraints defined by the system or `policy.xml` file.
- **Bypassing Resource Limits:** The `policy.xml` file's memory limits can be bypassed because the memory allocation occurs before the `SetImageExtent` function, which is responsible for applying these limits.
- The memory allocation happens before the image extent is set or checked.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory exhaustion:** An attacker can craft a malicious EPT file with very large values for `postscript_length` and `tiff_length`, forcing the `ReadEPTImage` function to allocate excessive amounts of memory, leading to denial of service by exhausting available RAM and potentially causing system instability.
- The provided `top` output clearly demonstrates the memory consumption growth during the vulnerability exploitation, reaching multiple gigabytes and bypassing the 100MB limit set in the policy file.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious EPT file needs to be crafted and supplied to the ImageMagick utility, which then reads the file via the vulnerable `ReadEPTImage` function, for processing or analysis.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide an arbitrary file to a program using ImageMagick. No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote, as long as they can deliver the malformed EPT file to a vulnerable ImageMagick installation.

**Additional details:**
- The provided bug report from Debian and the issue report from GitHub provide more context and detail than the CVE description, detailing code locations, memory allocation and a test case.
- The fix involves adding proper input validation of the length fields before the memory allocation, so the allocated memory would be within the system resource limits.
