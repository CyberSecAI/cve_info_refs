{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `FileUploadServlet` class does not check the user-controlled `fileName` parameter using `hasVulnerabilityInFileName` function when uploading a file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of input validation for the filename parameter during file uploads."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can upload a malicious file with a crafted file name to a directory allowing server-side script execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
