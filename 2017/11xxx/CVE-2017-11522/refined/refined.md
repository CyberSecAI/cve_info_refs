Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11522:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a null-pointer dereference in the `WriteOnePNGImage` function of ImageMagick.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Null-Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash. This happens in `coders/png.c` at line 8494 within the `WriteOnePNGImage` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The null-pointer dereference results in a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) and program termination, leading to a denial of service. The program crashes and becomes unavailable, which could disrupt workflows relying on it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted MNG image file. The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MNG file to the ImageMagick utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted MNG image file to the ImageMagick application, either by uploading it, providing it as an argument, or through other means. The attacker does not need to be privileged and can be remote.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by lcatro and confirmed through a crash in AddressSanitizer.
*   The specific crash was triggered by converting a crafted MNG image to another MNG image. The command used to trigger the crash is: `./magick convert SEGV_output_mng_WriteOnePNGImage output.mng`.
*   The issue is located in the `coders/png.c` file of ImageMagick.
*   The bug was initially reported as affecting multiple versions of ImageMagick but was later determined to only impact ImageMagick-7

*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2017-11522 as part of Debian Bug #869209
