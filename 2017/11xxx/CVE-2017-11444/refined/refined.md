The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Subrion CMS version 4.1.4.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input passed through the `$GET` request parameters. These parameters are directly used to construct SQL queries within the `search.php` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`$GET` parameters), which is then directly included in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Direct use of `$GET` parameters:** The `doAjaxItemSearch` function directly processes parameters from the `$GET` array without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Insecure Query Construction:** The `_getQueryStmtByParams` method constructs the SQL WHERE clause using unsanitized input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries to extract sensitive data, modify data, or even gain control over the database server. The example provided in the content shows how an attacker can retrieve the database user by injecting SQL code.
- **Unauthorized access to data:** Attackers can bypass normal access controls and retrieve data they are not authorized to view.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with SQL injection payloads within the parameters.
- **`search.php`:** The vulnerable code resides in the `/front/search.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the Subrion CMS instance.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
