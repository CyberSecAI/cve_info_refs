Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the `BasePageSessionExpire.cs` file of Trend Micro Control Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application's XML parser improperly handles external entities, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML that references external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can force the XML parser to access and embed the contents of specified URIs into the XML document. This enables the attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information from the server's file system or other resources that the server has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Crafted URI:** A specially crafted URI is used to trigger the vulnerability. The URI is embedded in XML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** An attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
