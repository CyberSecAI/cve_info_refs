# [2.2.{1,2}] Windows LoadLibrary DLL hijacking vulnerability (CVE-2017-11742) #82

## Description

[![@vszakats](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4&size=48)](/vszakats)[vszakats](https://github.com/vszakats)opened [on Jul 14, 2017](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/82#issue-243099320)

Starting with 2.2.1, libexpat added a `LoadLibrary()` call to load the `ADVAPI32.DLL` Windows system DLL to improve random numbers. This call however is prone to a known [DLL hijacking vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/31687.pdf), with no (trivial) way to opt-out from this by apps making use of libexpat. The attack works by building a tailor-made `ADVAPI32.DLL` that exports the function required and called by libexpat, and copying that DLL to the directory of the user application or to the current directory.

My (already proposed in [#62](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/pull/62)) patch is this:

```

```

It will resolve the problem for Windows Vista and newer versions, thus covering all officially supported versions of Windows. For older versions the generally recommended method is to detect `SYSTEM32` directory and prepend that to the loaded DLL name.
