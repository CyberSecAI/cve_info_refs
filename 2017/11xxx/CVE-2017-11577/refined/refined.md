Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-11577:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `getsid` function within `parsettf.c`. This occurs during the parsing of a crafted OpenType font file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer overflow in the `getsid` function. The `getsid` function attempts to read data beyond the bounds of the `stdtables` array leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (application crash) due to the buffer overflow.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can craft the overflow to overwrite executable code, although the provided information doesn't confirm successful arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- By tricking a user into opening a maliciously crafted OpenType font file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted OpenType font file which triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the malicious font file using FontForge.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided github content includes a detailed crash report with AddressSanitizer, confirming the location and type of the vulnerability.
- The debian advisory confirms that this CVE is associated with a security update for fontforge.
- The provided github content also contains a link to a proof-of-concept exploit file, which is named `getsid-in-parsettf.c-global-buffer-overflow.otf`.
