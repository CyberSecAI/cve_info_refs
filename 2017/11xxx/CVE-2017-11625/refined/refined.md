Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11625:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed PDF file.
- The `QPDF::resolveObjectsInStream` function enters an infinite loop when processing the crafted PDF.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop in `QPDF::resolveObjectsInStream` and related functions.
- Improper handling of specific PDF structures or objects, causing the program to loop indefinitely.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The infinite loop consumes system resources (CPU, stack space), leading to a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted PDF file to be processed by QPDF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a PDF file to the QPDF application. No special position is required.

**Additional details:**
- The stack trace shows a recursive loop involving  `QPDF::resolveObjectsInStream`, `QPDF::resolve`, and `QPDFObjectHandle::dereference`, and `QPDFObjectHandle::isStream`, indicating the crafted PDF triggers a continuous cycle of object resolution.
- The issue was discovered in qpdf version 6.0.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by the ADLab of Venustech.
- The provided PoC is available at  `https://github.com/bestshow/p0cs/blob/master/qpdf-infiniteloop_4`.
- Ubuntu has released a patch for this vulnerability in USN-3638-1, upgrading to QPDF 8.0.2-3.
