  "CVE-2017-11448": {
    "description": "A data leak vulnerability exists in ImageMagick. When processing a malformed JPEG file, the pixel buffer was not cleared, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly clear a pixel buffer when processing a malformed JPEG file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data Leak",
      "Inadequate data handling",
      "Insufficient error handling"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially leak sensitive information from the process memory by supplying a specially crafted JPEG image.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves supplying a malformed JPEG file to ImageMagick for processing.",
     "The vulnerability can be triggered by any application using the affected ImageMagick library to process untrusted image files."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed JPEG file to the vulnerable application.",
    "additional_details": "The fix involves zeroing the pixel buffer to prevent information leakage when a malformed JPEG is encountered. The vulnerability is located in the `ReadJPEGImage` function within the `coders/jpeg.c` file, and the fix ensures that the `jpeg_pixels` memory area is properly reset before use.",
