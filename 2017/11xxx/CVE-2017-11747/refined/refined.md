Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `tinyproxy` daemon creating its PID file (`/var/run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid`) *after* dropping privileges to a non-root account. This means the PID file is created and owned by the non-root user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure PID File Handling:** The core issue is the creation of the PID file after privilege dropping, which makes it writable by the non-root user. This violates the principle that the PID file should be controlled by a trusted entity (root).

*   **Trust of PID File Contents:** The vulnerability is exploitable when a root process blindly trusts and uses the contents of the PID file. Specifically, the init script would execute `kill \`cat /run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid\``, which if the file has been modified, would send a signal to a wrong process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Process Signalling (Local Privilege Escalation):** A local user who has access to the non-root account (that tinyproxy runs under) can modify the PID file to contain the PID of an arbitrary process (including a root one).  Then a root process (e.g., init script) that tries to signal tinyproxy would instead signal the targeted process. This could lead to:
    *   **Denial of Service:** By signaling a critical root process (e.g. init, cron), the attacker can cause a DoS.
    *   **Other unforeseen consequences:** The effects of signaling the wrong process could depend on the target process's signal handling logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** An attacker must have local access to the system and be able to write to the PID file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Non-Root User:** An attacker must be able to write to the PID file, which is owned by the non-root user that `tinyproxy` runs under.
*   **Knowledge of Root Script Usage:** An attacker needs to know that some root script is using the content of the PID file, especially the command `kill \`cat /run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid\``

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is considered a "minor security issue" but is "exploitable".
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `tinyproxy` version `1.8.3-3+deb8u1`.
*   The related Debian bug IDs are 870307 and 948283.
*   A separate, severe packaging flaw was also discovered that allowed a logrotate script to change the owner of the root directory. However, this is unrelated to CVE-2017-11747.
