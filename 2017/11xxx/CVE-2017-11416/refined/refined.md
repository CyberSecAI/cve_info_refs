Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in various PHP files of the Fiyo CMS. Several parameters from `$_POST`, `$_GET`, and `$_REQUEST` are directly inserted into SQL queries without any filtering or escaping, which leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into various parameters, leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data. The use of PDO does not prevent SQL injection if the queries are not properly parameterized. Stacked queries are used in the provided examples to execute multiple SQL queries and expand the scope of the attack.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There's a systemic failure to sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries.  This is present in multiple files and across different request methods (GET, POST, REQUEST).
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not perform adequate validation to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats or lengths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By crafting specific SQL injection payloads, an attacker can gain elevated privileges within the application.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not specifically mentioned, malicious queries could potentially cause performance issues or denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While not explicitly stated, the ability to execute arbitrary SQL could lead to the ability to execute operating system commands in some cases (e.g., via `xp_cmdshell` on SQL Server).

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests to various PHP scripts within the Fiyo CMS:
- **HTTP POST Requests:** Several scripts in the `/apps/` directory are vulnerable through POST parameters such as `id`, `art_title`, `name`, `email`, `url`, `text`, `comment`, `web`, `status`, `parent_id`, `desc`, `keys`, and `level`.
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Several scripts in the `/dapur/apps/` directory are vulnerable through GET parameters such as `cat`, `user`, `level`, `iSortCol_`, `id`, and `stat`.
- **HTTP REQUEST:** Scripts in the `/dapur/apps/` directory are vulnerable to `id` parameter via `$_REQUEST`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Fiyo CMS web server.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify vulnerable input parameters in the application by reviewing the code or trying a variety of payloads.
