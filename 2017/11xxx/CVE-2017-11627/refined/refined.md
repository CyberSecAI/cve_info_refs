Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an infinite loop within the `libqpdf` library when processing specifically crafted PDF files. This loop occurs during the object resolution process, specifically when resolving objects within a stream. The issue arises from the way the code handles indirect object references, which leads to a recursive call chain involving `QPDF::resolveObjectsInStream`, `QPDF::resolve`, `QPDF::Resolver::resolve` and `QPDFObjectHandle::dereference`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop: A malformed PDF file can trigger an infinite loop in the object resolution logic. This happens because the resolution process gets stuck in a recursive loop while trying to resolve indirect objects within a stream, which repeatedly calls the same functions without ever reaching a base case to break out of the loop.
- Stack overflow: The recursive loop results in excessive function calls that exhaust the stack memory, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS). The infinite loop consumes system resources, causing the `qpdf` tool to become unresponsive and crash due to a stack overflow. This effectively prevents the tool from processing any PDF file correctly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the infinite loop when processed by `qpdf`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PDF file to a system running the vulnerable version of `qpdf`. This could involve tricking a user into opening a malicious file, or providing the file as input through a web service or other means.

**Additional details:**
- The provided stack trace clearly shows the recursive function calls leading to the stack overflow. The calls involve the `resolveObjectsInStream`, `resolve`, `QPDF::Resolver::resolve` and `QPDFObjectHandle::dereference` functions.
- The vulnerability affects `qpdf` version 6.0.0.
- The issue was initially reported on the qpdf GitHub issue page in June 2017.
- The vulnerability was addressed in later versions of qpdf, as indicated by the Ubuntu security notice. The fix was included in version 8.0.2-3 of the Ubuntu package.
