### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Sergey Temnikov and Vladimir Dashchenko from Kaspersky Labs reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

**--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------**

Siemens recommends that users upgrade License Management System (LMS) to version 2.1 SP4 (2.1.681) or newer. To do so, users should follow the instructions at <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109479834> or contact the local Siemens representative or Siemens customer support.

**--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 --------**

**NOTE:** Users using Desigo CC MP2.1 or older need to upgrade ALM Manager before applying the update to LMS.

Siemens has released the following advisory:

<https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-727467.pdf>

NCCIC recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website.](/ics/)

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any speciﬁc mitigations or workarounds.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

License Management System (LMS) is the uniﬁed license management system for Siemens’ building
automation products such as Desigo CC and ABT.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-11496

Malformed ASN1 streams in V2C and similar input ﬁles can be used to generate stack-based buffer
overﬂows. The vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution.
