The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in ImageMagick's `ReadMATImage` function, specifically within the `coders/mat.c` file. This is related to CVE-2017-11644, which also describes a memory leak vulnerability in the same function and file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory leak in the `ReadMATImage` function when handling a specially crafted MAT file. The vulnerability occurs during the decompression of data within the MAT file. Specifically, there's a failure to free allocated memory after an error in the `decompress_block` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in `ReadMATImage` function, specifically in `decompress_block`
- Improper error handling
- Failure to release allocated memory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion leading to denial of service.
- Application crash due to memory exhaustion

**Attack vectors:**
- By processing a specially crafted MAT image file using ImageMagick, this can be done through the command line using the `convert` utility, or any other program or application that uses ImageMagick to process images.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious MAT file to ImageMagick. This could be through a website that uses ImageMagick, a file upload to a server, or an email attachment that is processed by ImageMagick.
