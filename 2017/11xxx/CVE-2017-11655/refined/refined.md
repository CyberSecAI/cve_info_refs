Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11655:

**CVE-2017-11655**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a memory leak in the `sipcrack` software, specifically within the `stringtoarray` function in `wrap.c` and `parse_sip_proto` in `SIPdump.c`. Memory allocated for `lines` array within these functions is not being freed in certain error or normal exit paths.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Memory Leak:** The `stringtoarray` function reallocates memory to store lines but doesn't free the memory when done or in error cases. Likewise, `parse_sip_proto` leaks memory when parsing SIP packets.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak leads to memory exhaustion, which can crash long-running `sipdump` sessions. This effectively causes a denial of service by making the tool unavailable.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Network:** Crafted network traffic containing SIP packets triggers the memory leak when processed by `sipdump`.
    *   **Local:** Opening a specially crafted `.pcap` file, which contains the SIP packets that cause the leak, can also trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network traffic manipulation:** An attacker needs to be able to generate and send specially crafted SIP packets to the target.
    *   **Local file access:** Alternatively, the attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.pcap` file to the target.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided text includes a patch that fixes the memory leak by adding `free(lines)` in `SIPcrack.c` and `SIPdump.c` in the affected code paths.
* The document also discusses three other vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-11654 (out-of-bounds read/write), and two additional out-of-bounds read issues without assigned CVEs.
