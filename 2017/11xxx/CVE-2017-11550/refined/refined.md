The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in libid3tag version 0.15.1b, only the first of which corresponds to CVE-2017-11550.

**Vulnerability 1 (CVE-2017-11550):**

*   **Root Cause:** A null pointer dereference occurs in the `id3_ucs4_length` function within `ucs4.c`.
*   **Weakness:** The function does not handle a null pointer passed as an argument, leading to a crash when dereferencing it.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash).
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted MP3 file containing a malformed ID3 tag that triggers the vulnerable code path.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide the crafted MP3 file to an application that uses the vulnerable libid3tag library (e.g., mpg321).
*   **Technical Details:** The `id3_ucs4_length` function iterates through a null-terminated UCS4 string to calculate its length. However, if a null pointer is passed as input, the `while (*ptr)` condition causes a segmentation fault due to the attempt to dereference the null pointer. The provided gdb output shows the crash at `ucs4.c:46` when `ucs4` is `0x0`.

**Vulnerability 2 (CVE-2017-11551):**
*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-memory (OOM) condition in the `id3_field_parse` function within `field.c`.
*   **Weakness:** The function can enter a loop that continuously allocates memory without proper checks, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.
*  **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash due to OOM)
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted MP3 file containing a malformed ID3 tag that triggers the vulnerable code path.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide the crafted MP3 file to an application that uses the vulnerable libid3tag library (e.g., mpg321).
*   **Technical Details:**  The `id3_field_parse` function iterates through data and calls `id3_parse_string`. Inside a while loop, it reallocates memory for `field->stringlist.strings`. With a specific input, the `id3_parse_string` might return a non-null value without consuming any data. This causes the loop to go infinite reallocating memory until the system runs out of memory.
