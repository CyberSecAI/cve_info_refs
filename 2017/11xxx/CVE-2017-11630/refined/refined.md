The provided content describes a vulnerability in Fiyo CMS version 2.0.7, which is related to CVE-2017-11630.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `backuper.php` script does not properly sanitize or validate the `$_POST['type']` and `$_POST['file']` parameters. This allows an attacker to manipulate these parameters to delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unvalidated input: The application directly uses user-supplied input from `$_POST` without proper sanitization.
- Path traversal: The lack of input validation allows attackers to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`) in the `$_POST['file']` parameter to access and delete files outside the intended directory.
- File deletion vulnerability: The ability to delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file deletion: An attacker can delete any file on the server that the web server process has permissions to access.
- Data loss: This could lead to loss of critical files, including configuration files, application code, or user data.
- System compromise: The attacker might be able to remove vital system files, causing application and possibly system-wide disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a POST request to the vulnerable `backuper.php` script.
- Manipulation of parameters: The attacker includes malicious values in the `type` and `file` parameters of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the server hosting Fiyo CMS.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to log into the application.
- Knowledge of vulnerable script location: The attacker needs to know the path of `backuper.php`.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with specific parameter values.

**Additional notes:**
