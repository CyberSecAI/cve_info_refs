The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11157.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of untrusted search path vulnerabilities in the Synology Cloud Station Backup installer for Windows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to the installer's failure to properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files. Specifically, it is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. The installer attempts to load DLLs (shfolder.dll, ntmarta.dll, secur32.dll, or dwmapi.dll) from the current working directory, before checking the system directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL (one of shfolder.dll, ntmarta.dll, secur32.dll, or dwmapi.dll) in the same directory where the installer is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the installer is executed, and the ability to place a malicious DLL file in the current working directory before running the installer. The user running the installer must also have the privilege to execute the installer.
