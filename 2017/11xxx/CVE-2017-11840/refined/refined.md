{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Chakra JIT compiler's `GlobOpt::OptTagChecks` function. This function emits a `BailOnNotObject` opcode during the first analysis pass of a loop (when `IsLoopPrePass` is true). However, the type of a variable (`valueType.HasBeenNumber()`) might change in the second analysis pass. If the type changes to a non-object type after the first analysis where BailOnNotObject was emitted, a type confusion can occur because the bail-out check is no longer valid.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of type changes across JIT compiler analysis passes.",
        "The JIT compiler emits bailout opcode based on an analysis pass condition and does not consider subsequent changes in variable type."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted JavaScript code in Microsoft Edge.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in Microsoft Edge, typically through a webpage."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided exploit-db entry includes a proof-of-concept JavaScript code that demonstrates the type confusion vulnerability and confirms that type confusion could lead to a denial-of-service."
