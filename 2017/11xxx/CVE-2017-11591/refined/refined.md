Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a floating-point exception within the `Exiv2::ValueType` function when processing crafted image files, specifically TIFF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A lack of proper input validation when handling TIFF image data, specifically regarding the size of directory entries.
- The `Exiv2::ValueType::toLong` function doesn't handle invalid or unexpected data types, leading to a floating-point exception.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when calculating the number of strips in a TIFF image, leading to the floating point exception during the conversion to `long`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote denial of service (DoS). The application crashes due to the unhandled floating-point exception, making it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires a specially crafted image file (TIFF format).
- The crafted file must contain malformed metadata that triggers the flaw.
- The file needs to be processed by the vulnerable `exiv2` application or library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious image file to a user or system using the vulnerable `exiv2` library.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker can be a remote user, by delivering a malicious image to a user.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided stack trace shows the exact location of the crash within `Exiv2::ValueType::toLong`, `TiffImageEntry::setStrips`, `TiffReader::readDataEntryBase`, `TiffDirectory::doAccept`, `TiffComponent::accept` and other related functions.
- The vulnerability was reported by team OWL337, who used a custom fuzzer called collAFL to discover it.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves validating the size of TIFF directory entries and handling invalid data types gracefully.
- The issue is also present in other components of the library, such as the handling of PNG files, as shown in the Ubuntu security notice.
