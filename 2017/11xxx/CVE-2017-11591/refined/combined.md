# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

                 932467 946341 987277 992705 992706

This update fixes a number of memory access violations and other input
validation failures that can be triggered by passing specially crafted files to
exiv2.

CVE-2017-11591

    There is a Floating point exception in the Exiv2::ValueType function that
    will lead to a remote denial of service attack via crafted input.

CVE-2017-14859

    An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in
    Exiv2::StringValueBase::read in value.cpp. The vulnerability causes a
    segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.

CVE-2017-14862

    An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in
    Exiv2::DataValue::read in value.cpp. The vulnerability causes a
    segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.

CVE-2017-14864

    An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in Exiv2::getULong in
    types.cpp. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application
    crash, which leads to denial of service.

CVE-2017-17669

    There is a heap-based buffer over-read in the
    Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::keyTXTChunk function of pngchunk_int.cpp. A
    crafted PNG file will lead to a remote denial of service attack.

CVE-2017-18005

    Exiv2 has a Null Pointer Dereference in the Exiv2::DataValue::toLong
    function in value.cpp, related to crafted metadata in a TIFF file.

CVE-2018-8976

    jpgimage.cpp allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (image.cpp Exiv2::Internal::stringFormat out-of-bounds read) via a crafted
    file.

CVE-2018-17581

    CiffDirectory::readDirectory() at crwimage_int.cpp has excessive stack
    consumption due to a recursive function, leading to Denial of service.

CVE-2018-19107

    Exiv2::IptcParser::decode in iptc.cpp (called from psdimage.cpp in the PSD
    image reader) may suffer from a denial of service (heap-based buffer
    over-read) caused by an integer overflow via a crafted PSD image file.

CVE-2018-19108

    Exiv2::PsdImage::readMetadata in psdimage.cpp in the PSD image reader may
    suffer from a denial of service (infinite loop) caused by an integer
    overflow via a crafted PSD image file.

CVE-2018-19535

    PngChunk::readRawProfile in pngchunk_int.cpp may cause a denial of service
    (application crash due to a heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted PNG
    file.

CVE-2018-20097

    There is a SEGV in Exiv2::Internal::TiffParserWorker::findPrimaryGroups of
    tiffimage_int.cpp. A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of service
    attack.

CVE-2019-13110

    A CiffDirectory::readDirectory integer overflow and out-of-bounds read
    allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (SIGSEGV) via a crafted CRW
    image file.

CVE-2019-13112

    A PngChunk::parseChunkContent uncontrolled memory allocation allows an
    attacker to cause a denial of service (crash due to an std::bad_alloc
    exception) via a crafted PNG image file.

CVE-2019-13114

    http.c allows a malicious http server to cause a denial of service (crash
    due to a NULL pointer dereference) by returning a crafted response that
    lacks a space character.

CVE-2019-13504

    There is an out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata in
    mrwimage.cpp.

CVE-2019-14369

    Exiv2::PngImage::readMetadata() in pngimage.cpp allows attackers to cause a
    denial of service (heap-based buffer over- read) via a crafted image file.

CVE-2019-14370

    There is an out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata() in
    mrwimage.cpp. It could result in denial of service.

CVE-2019-17402

    Exiv2 allows attackers to trigger a crash in Exiv2::getULong in types.cpp
    when called from Exiv2::Internal::CiffDirectory::readDirectory in
    crwimage_int.cpp, because there is no validation of the relationship of the
    total size to the offset and size.

CVE-2020-18771

    Exiv2 has a global buffer over-read in
    Exiv2::Internal::Nikon1MakerNote::print0x0088 in nikonmn_int.cpp which can
    result in an information leak.

CVE-2021-29458

    An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2. The out-of- bounds read is
    triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.
    An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial
    of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when
    writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than
    reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2
    command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument
    such as insert.

CVE-2021-32815

    The assertion
    failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the
    victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug
    is only triggered when modifying the metadata, which is a less
    frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For
    example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
    need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`.

CVE-2021-34334

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file.

CVE-2021-37620

    An out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata
    of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
    into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.

CVE-2021-37621

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when
    printing the image ICC profile, which is a less frequently used Exiv2
    operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p C`).

CVE-2021-37622

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of
    a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
    into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only
    triggered when deleting the IPTC data, which is a less frequently used
    Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-d I rm`).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.25-4+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your exiv2 packages.
