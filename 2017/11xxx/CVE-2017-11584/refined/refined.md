Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities mentioned, including CVE-2017-11584, as well as other vulnerabilities described in the document:

**CVE-2017-11584 is related to SQL injection vulnerability via `$system['field']` parameter**

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. URL Redirector Abuse**
   - **Root Cause:** The `sync` function in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/Weixin.php` redirects to any URL provided without validation.
    - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation on the `url` parameter.
    - **Impact:**  An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Direct access to the `sync` function through the `url` parameter.
    - **Required Capabilities:** No special capabilities are required; any user can access this URL.

**2. Reflected XSS**
    - **Root Cause:**  The username parameter in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/admin/Login.php` is not properly sanitized. The `xssclean` filter only filters the username starting with `'<'`. If DOM XSS is used, it outputs without any validated, sanitized, or output encoding.
    - **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input sanitization and lack of output encoding.
    - **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they try to log into the admin page with a malicious username.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `username` POST parameter when submitting the login form.
    - **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker needs to be able to submit a login form with a malicious username.

**3. api.php Reflected XSS**
    - **Root Cause:** The `function` parameter in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/api.php`'s `data2` function is output directly into the page without validation when the function does not exist.
    - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding for the `function` parameter.
    - **Impact:**  An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Directly accessing the `data2` function in `api.php` with a malicious `function` parameter.
    - **Required Capabilities:** No special capabilities are required; any user can access this URL.

**4. SQL injection in `action=related` `catid` parameter**
    - **Root Cause:** The `catid` parameter in the `list_tag` function (Template.php) when `action=related` is split by commas and inserted into an SQL query without sanitization.
    - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization on the `catid` parameter.
    - **Impact:** An attacker can perform SQL injection, potentially gaining access to sensitive database information or modifying data.
    - **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `catid` parameter in the `action=related` context.
    - **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker needs to know the `SYS_KEY` (obtained from cookies) to craft a valid API request.

**5. SQL injection after limit via `$system[num]` parameter**
    - **Root Cause:** The `$system['num']` parameter in `list_tag` function when `action=tags` or `action=related`  is inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization on the `num` parameter.
    - **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this using `PROCEDURE analyse()` for SQL injection to extract data when using versions of MySQL between 5.0.0 and 5.6.6.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `num` parameter in the context of `action=tags` or `action=related`.
    - **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker needs to know the `SYS_KEY` (obtained from cookies) and the target needs to be running vulnerable MySQL version.

**6. SQL injection via `$system[field]` parameter (CVE-2017-11584)**
   - **Root Cause:** The `$system['field']` parameter in the `list_tag` function (Template.php), when action is `related`, `form`, `member`, or `module`, is inserted into an SQL query without sanitization.
    - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization on the `field` parameter.
    - **Impact:** An attacker can perform SQL injection, potentially gaining access to sensitive database information or modifying data.
    - **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `field` parameter within the specified `action` contexts.
    - **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to know the `SYS_KEY` (obtained from cookies) to craft a valid API request.

**7. Remote PHP Code Execution**
    - **Root Cause:** The `list_tag` function with `action=cache` allows the injection of the `$_param` parameter into an `eval` function.
    - **Weaknesses:** Use of `eval` with unsanitized input.
    - **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `name` parameter in the context of `action=cache`.
    - **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker needs to know the `SYS_KEY` (obtained from cookies) to craft a valid API request.

In summary, this document details multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS before version 5.0.9, including URL redirect, XSS, SQL injections, and remote code execution. The primary weaknesses are a lack of input validation and insufficient output encoding leading to various forms of attack.
