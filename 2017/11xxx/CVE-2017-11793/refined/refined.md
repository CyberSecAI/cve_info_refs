{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the jscript.dll library. This occurs because the return value of the `toString` method of a JSON object's property is not included in the garbage collector's root object list, allowing it to be freed during subsequent callbacks. Specifically, when JSONStringifyObject calls JSONApplyFilters which in turn calls an object's toString method. If the toString method invokes a garbage collection cycle, the object can be freed while JSONStringifyObject is still trying to access it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-After-Free (UAF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause a crash due to an access violation, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific JavaScript object that, when processed by `JSON.stringify`, triggers the use-after-free condition.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of Internet Explorer 11, either through a malicious webpage or a compromised website."
