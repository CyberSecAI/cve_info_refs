Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11509

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Firebird SQL Server allowing users to define external functions with entry points that do not match the original definitions. Specifically, the `ENTRY_POINT` in a `DECLARE EXTERNAL FUNCTION` statement can be set to an existing function, while changing the function's parameters, leading to type mismatches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Function Pointer Overwriting:** By creating an external function with mismatched parameters, specifically a `VARCHAR` instead of a `BLOB`, an attacker can overwrite the `blob_put_segment` function pointer within a `blobcallback` struct.
- **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability arises from the ability to declare external functions with parameter types that don't match the expected types, leading to memory corruption and ultimately arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM. This means that an attacker can gain complete control over the server running the Firebird SQL instance.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With code execution capabilities, the attacker can read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the database service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed SQL statement:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing a crafted SQL statement that declares an external function with a mismatched parameter type.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network, given an authenticated connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to connect to the Firebird SQL server.
- **Database User Privileges:** The attacker needs to have the privilege to create external functions, which is typically granted to database administrators or privileged users.
