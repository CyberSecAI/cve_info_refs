Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11691:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `Referer` HTTP header in the `auth_profile.php` file of Cacti 1.1.13. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or encode the value of the `Referer` header before using it in the `document.location` redirect within the JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application takes user-controlled input from the `Referer` header and directly injects it into the HTML without proper sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or encode the `Referer` header before using it within the JavaScript context, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the user's browser, which is executed in the context of the vulnerable Cacti application.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could steal session cookies and gain access to the user's account.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites or prompt them to download malware.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to `auth_profile.php?action=edit` with a specially crafted `Referer` header containing the XSS payload.
- An authenticated user is required to trigger the vulnerability by clicking on the "Return" button at the bottom of the page, which executes JavaScript code that uses the malicious `Referer` header value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to the Cacti application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Forge HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send an HTTP request with a modified `Referer` header.
- **User Interaction (Click):** The user needs to click the "Return" button for the malicious script to be executed.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was identified by "kimiizhang" and reported as a new XSS vulnerability even after the vendor addressed two previous XSS issues in version 1.1.13.
- The fix involved replacing `<?php print $_SESSION['profile_referer'];?>` with `<?php print htmlspecialchars($_SESSION['profile_referer']);?>` to ensure the referer is HTML encoded, preventing the execution of malicious Javascript when the return button is pressed.
- This patch was applied in commit `104090aeead4aa433bf1f18cd6d52dcfeb71236c`.
