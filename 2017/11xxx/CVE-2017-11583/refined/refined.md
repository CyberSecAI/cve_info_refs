The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS before version 5.0.9. Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-11583, which is listed among the vulnerabilities discussed:

**CVE-2017-11583:** This CVE ID is associated with a SQL injection vulnerability in the `action=related` functionality.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `catid` parameter within the `list_tag` function of `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php`. The `catid` parameter, which is expected to be a comma-separated list of category IDs, is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper validation or sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The primary weakness is the injection of unsanitized user-controlled input directly into an SQL query.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the format and content of the `catid` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    *   **Database Exposure:** The attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Potential Data Modification:** It's implied that an attacker could modify the data, although the content mainly highlights the read ability.
    *   **Complete Database Access:** By chaining multiple sql injection vulnerabilities, the attacker can potentially gain complete access to the database, including the user table where passwords are kept.
    
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `catid` parameter within an HTTP request to `index.php` via `api.php`.
    *   **Specific API Endpoint:** The API endpoint `index.php?c=api&m=data2` is used as the main point to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to the application:** The attacker needs to access the FineCMS web application.
    *   **Knowledge of the API structure:** The attacker must have some knowledge of the API structure.
    * **`SYS_KEY` Value:**  The attacker needs to know the system's `SYS_KEY` to generate a valid authentication hash. This is retrieved from a cookie.

The content also describes other vulnerabilities which are assigned different CVE IDs:
*   **URL Redirector Abuse (CVE-2017-11581):** Unrestricted redirection via the `sync` function in `Weixin.php`.
*   **Reflected XSS (CVE-2017-11582):** Occurs in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/admin/Login.php` due to insufficient input sanitization when an invalid username is entered.
*   **Reflected XSS in api.php (CVE-2017-11584):** Vulnerability in `api.php` where function parameters are outputted without sanitization.
*  **SQL Injection via `$system[num]` parameter (CVE-2017-11585):** SQL Injection vulnerability in  `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php` via the `num` parameter.
* **SQL Injection via `$system[field]` parameter (CVE-2017-11586):** SQL Injection vulnerability in `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php` via the `field` parameter.
*   **Remote PHP Code Execution:** Code execution vulnerability in `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php` via the `cache` action.
