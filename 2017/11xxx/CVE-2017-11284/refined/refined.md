The provided document discusses multiple CVEs, including CVE-2017-11284.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unsafe Java deserialization

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data. The specific vector is not described in this document, but would be related to a mechanism that allows an attacker to inject a serialized Java object, which when deserialized, would execute arbitrary code

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious serialized Java object to the vulnerable system to be deserialized.
