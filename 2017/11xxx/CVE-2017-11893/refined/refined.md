{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-11893",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Chakra JavaScript engine's JIT compiler incorrectly handles optimizations for `Math.max.apply` and `Math.min.apply` calls. Specifically, when these functions are used with an array-like argument, the engine attempts to optimize the call by directly invoking `JavascriptMath::MaxInAnArray` or `JavascriptMath::MinInAnArray`. However, these optimized methods do not properly check if the original `Math.max` or `Math.min` properties have been changed (e.g., replaced with a user-defined function).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of user-defined function replacements for built-in methods.",
      "Lack of validation to ensure the intended built-in methods are called after JIT optimization."
    ],
    "impact": "This can lead to unexpected behavior, as a user-defined JavaScript function can be called instead of the intended built-in `Math.max` or `Math.min`. This can lead to a denial of service by causing a crash or unexpected state changes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker would need to execute malicious JavaScript code within a context that uses the Chakra JavaScript engine.",
      "The attacker replaces built-in `Math.max` or `Math.min` properties with user-defined code."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable environment (Microsoft Edge).",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerability and ability to craft malicious code to trigger it."
    ]
