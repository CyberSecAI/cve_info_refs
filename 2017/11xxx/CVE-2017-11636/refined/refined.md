Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `WriteRGBImage` function within `coders/rgb.c`. This overflow occurs when processing image files with multiple frames of varying widths. The code was not properly reallocating memory for the pixel data when the frame width changed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The core vulnerability is that `MagickReallocMemory` was not being called correctly when the image frame changed widths, allowing a buffer to be overflown during write operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the application, causing a denial of service.
- **Disclosure of in-memory information:** Overflows can sometimes be exploited to read sensitive data from memory.
- **Other Unspecified Impact:** The provided information suggests that other unspecified impacts are possible. The Debian security advisory mentions potential arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Processing Malformed Image Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when GraphicsMagick processes a specially crafted image file. The malformed file causes the program to allocate insufficient memory.
- **RGB Images with Multiple Frames:** Specifically, the vulnerability arises when processing RGB image files that contain multiple frames where the frames have varying widths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image to the GraphicsMagick software. This might involve direct file uploads, or by tricking a user into processing a file under the attacker's control.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves ensuring that `MagickReallocMemory` is called when needed with the new width during the writing of RGB image files.
- Patches were made to the `coders/rgb.c` source file
- This vulnerability affects GraphicsMagick, a set of image processing tools.
- Multiple CVEs, including CVE-2017-11636, were fixed in the security updates for both Debian and Ubuntu.

The provided information gives more detail about the root cause, showing that the overflow is triggered when handling a varying width image frame in `WriteRGBImage`.
