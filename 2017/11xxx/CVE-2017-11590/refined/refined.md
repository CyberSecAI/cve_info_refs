The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11590.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `caseless_hash` function within `gxps-archive.c` of the `libgxps` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `caseless_hash` function attempts to convert a string to lowercase using `g_ascii_strdown` and then calculate a hash using `g_str_hash`. However, if the input `v` is NULL, then `g_ascii_strdown` will receive a NULL argument which will trigger a crash due to assertion failure, and cause a NULL pointer dereference when trying to hash a NULL `lower` pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and application crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input to `xpstojpeg` tool. Specifically when processing a file path, and a NULL pointer can be provided to the `caseless_hash` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute the `xpstojpeg` tool with crafted input files that trigger the NULL pointer dereference in `libgxps`.

**Additional details:**
- The issue occurs in the `caseless_hash` function in `gxps-archive.c`.
- The `g_ascii_strdown` function in `glib` receives a NULL pointer which will cause a crash when trying to lowercase it before passing it to `g_str_hash`.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) input file "POC1" is attached to the bug report, demonstrating the issue.
- The vulnerability was detected using a custom fuzzer called "collAFL".
