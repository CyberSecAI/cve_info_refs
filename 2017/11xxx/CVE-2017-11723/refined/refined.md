The provided content describes a path traversal vulnerability in JojoCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the `$_GET['deld']` parameter in the `deleteDirs` function within the `ImageManager.php` file. The function directly uses the rawurldecoded value of `$_GET['deld']` to delete directories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application allows directory traversal using relative paths like `../` in the `deld` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Directory Deletion:** An attacker can delete arbitrary directories on the server, potentially leading to data loss or system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to `backend.php` with the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote, Unauthorized Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates this.
