The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11290.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The document mentions a feature added to protect users from UI redressing (or clickjacking) attacks. This suggests the vulnerability arises from a lack of proper protection against UI redressing or clickjacking, which allows attackers to trick users into interacting with a hidden or overlaid element on a web page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is the susceptibility to UI redressing (clickjacking) attacks. This means a malicious user can trick a legitimate user into clicking on hidden elements by overlaying a legitimate page with a malicious one, therefore performing actions without the user's knowledge.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is listed as "information disclosure", which can happen when the user unintentionally performs actions through the attacker-controlled interface.

**Attack vectors:**
Clickjacking attacks are typically executed through a web browser, where the attacker embeds the victim site in an iframe within a malicious webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious webpage and trick the victim into opening the webpage while being logged into the vulnerable application.
