Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-11104:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is an improper implementation of the TSIG (Transaction Signature) protocol within Knot DNS. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how Knot DNS handles TSIG validity period checks. When a request with a timestamp outside the valid window is received, the server still processes and signs the response, using the invalid digest from the request as a prefix, without proper validation of its size or content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper TSIG Validity Period Check:** Knot DNS does not correctly validate the timestamp of incoming TSIG signed requests. It proceeds with signing a response even when the timestamp is outside the allowed time window, which should have resulted in a rejection and not signing an answer.
- **Incorrect Digest Handling:** When an out-of-window timestamp is detected, the server reuses the provided (invalid) request digest as a prefix for signing the response, instead of rejecting the request. This behavior allows for signature forgery.
- **Lack of Digest Size Validation:** The server does not validate the size of the provided digest before reusing it, allowing an attacker to provide a larger or invalid digest.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **TSIG Authentication Bypass:** An attacker with a valid key name and algorithm can bypass TSIG authentication by forging a valid signature, even with a timestamp outside the valid window.
- **Unauthorized Zone Updates:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized zone updates. This could enable the attacker to inject malicious records into the DNS zone.
- **Unauthorized Zone Transfers and Notify Operations**: The attacker can use the vulnerability to trigger zone transfers, effectively dumping the zone content, or to send notify messages.
- **Potential MITM:** While mitigation is possible by implementing ACLs and using hard-to-guess key names, these measures do not provide complete protection against a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network, targeting a vulnerable Knot DNS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of TSIG Key Name and Algorithm:** The attacker must know the valid TSIG key name and the associated algorithm used by the target DNS server.
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Knot DNS server.
- **No Additional ACL Restrictions:** The server should not have additional ACL restrictions configured to protect the targeted operations (transfer, notify, update) using TSIG.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is explained in detail by Synacktiv, including a proof of concept exploit. The attack exploits the server's flawed behavior of signing a response even if the request's timestamp is out of the valid range.

1.  **Trigger Request:** An initial request with a manipulated timestamp and digest is sent to the server, resulting in a BADTIME TSIG error response that is signed by the server, including the attacker provided digest as a prefix.
2.  **Signature Forgery:** This signed response, with the attacker controlled data, is then used as a template to create a valid TSIG signature. The attacker constructs a new DNS update message, padding it to accommodate the size of the DNS response, setting the TSIG error code and other data fields used in the digest calculation.
3.  **Forged Update:** The forged update request, carrying the newly computed valid signature, is then sent to the server, bypassing authentication and potentially updating zone records.

**Affected Versions:**

-   Knot DNS versions prior to 2.4.5
-   Knot DNS 2.5.x versions prior to 2.5.2

**Mitigation:**

-   Upgrade to Knot DNS 2.5.2 or 2.4.5 or later.
-   Implement ACLs on IP addresses for TSIG-protected operations to limit the attack surface.
-   Use hard-to-guess TSIG key names, but it does not protect against a MITM.

**Additional Notes:**

- Patches were made available in Debian, openSUSE, and SUSE to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2017-11104.
- A detailed write-up and proof-of-concept exploit were released by Synacktiv.
