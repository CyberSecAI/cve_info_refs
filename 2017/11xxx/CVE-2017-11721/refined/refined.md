Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11721

**Root Cause:**
* A read buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the idtech3 (Quake III Arena) family of game engines, specifically within the `MSG_ReadBits` function. The vulnerability occurs when the function attempts to read beyond the end of the message buffer, leading to a potential crash.
* Additionally, the `MSG_WriteBits` function had an inexact buffer overflow check which was corrected in this commit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Read buffer overflow:**  The `MSG_ReadBits` function lacks proper bounds checking, which allows it to read past the end of the allocated message buffer.
* **Inexact Buffer Overflow Check:** The original `MSG_WriteBits` function did not have an accurate check for buffer overflows and would not always prevent the overflow from occurring.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted packet can trigger a read buffer overflow, leading to an application crash.
* **Unspecified other impact:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to other unspecified impacts beyond a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted network packet.
* **Remote Attack:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is exploited via network packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs the ability to send crafted network packets to a vulnerable server running the affected game engine.
* No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided GitHub commit fixes the overflow in `MSG_ReadBits` by adding checks to ensure it doesn't read beyond the message buffer.
* The commit also fixes the `MSG_WriteBits` function to use an exact buffer overflow check, preventing potential overflows during writing.
* The issue affects multiple packages using the idtech3 engine, including `iortcw` and `ioquake3`, which are both fixed in respective security updates.
* Debian provided updates for both stable (stretch) and oldstable (jessie) distributions.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8/10, indicating critical severity.
* The EPSS score is 1.373%, which indicates a moderate likelihood of exploitation in the next 30 days.
