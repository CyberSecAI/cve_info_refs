  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `vagrant-vmware-fusion` plugin installs a sudo helper ruby script and architecture-specific wrappers. The wrapper is made suid root and executes the ruby script. The ruby script itself is not root-owned, allowing it to be overwritten with arbitrary code which will then be executed as root.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The sudo helper ruby script is not owned by root, allowing an attacker to overwrite it.",
      "The wrapper script executes the helper script with root privileges."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root. An attacker can overwrite the ruby script with malicious code, which is then executed with root privileges, granting full control over the system.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs local access to the system with user privileges."
