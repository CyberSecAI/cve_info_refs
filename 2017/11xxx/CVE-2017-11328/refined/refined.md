Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `yr_object_array_set_item()` function located in the `object.c` file of the YARA project. This function is responsible for setting items within an array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- When `yr_object_array_set_item()` needs to increase the array size to accommodate a new item at a larger index, it doubles the array's capacity. However, it lacks checks to ensure that the new index fits within the doubled capacity. This allows for an overflow if the index is larger than the doubled capacity, leading to writing beyond the allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, as indicated by CVSS.
- The vulnerability is triggered by scanning a specially crafted .NET binary. The new dotnet module in yara allows to specify an index that can trigger the vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted .NET file to be scanned by YARA.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute YARA.
- The attack requires user interaction, as per the CVSS vector.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `libyara/object.c`.
- The issue arises in the logic of resizing an array where the array capacity is doubled, but the check for fitting new index after doubling is missing.
- The commit `4a342f01e5439b9bb901aff1c6c23c536baeeb3f` on the VirusTotal/yara repository addresses this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when setting a new array item with `yr_object_array_set_item()`.
-  The vulnerability was reported by Jurriaan Bremer.
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-11328.
- This vulnerability is present in YARA 3.x versions.
