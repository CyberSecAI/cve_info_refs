Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by uncontrolled recursion within the `OP_KETRMAX` feature of the `match` function in `pcre_exec.c` in PCRE versions 8.41 and earlier. Specifically, a deeply nested regular expression with a specific structure triggers excessive stack usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is a stack exhaustion issue. The recursive calls to the `RMATCH` function, triggered by a crafted regular expression, can consume excessive stack space, leading to a crash due to stack overflow.
*   **Uncontrolled Recursion:** The code doesn't properly limit the depth of recursion when handling specific regular expressions, creating an avenue for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. The stack exhaustion leads to a crash, making the application or system using the vulnerable PCRE library unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Regular Expressions:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted regular expression to PCRE's matching functions.
*   **Wide Reach:**  PCRE is widely used in various applications, including web servers (like Apache and Nginx), programming languages (like PHP), and other software, creating a large attack surface. This is shown by the attacker noting "many methods! many program use pcre, like: php and nginx".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control Regular Expression Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted regular expression to a vulnerable application that uses the affected PCRE library.
*   **No Special Position Required:** The attack can be carried out remotely, requiring no special access or privileges on the target system, as the provided text says "Attack Type: Remote".

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2017-9729.
*   The specific line of code in pcre_exec.c related to the vulnerability is mentioned: `RMATCH(eptr, prev, offset_top, md, eptrb, RM13);`.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) regular expression is provided: `\x28\x61\x2A\x5C\x56\x2A\x5C\x43\x2B\x29\x2A\x6F\xE5\xA2\x80`.

The provided information also highlights that PCRE1 (8.x series) is no longer maintained and recommends upgrading to PCRE2, which uses heap storage instead of the stack, to mitigate this vulnerability.
