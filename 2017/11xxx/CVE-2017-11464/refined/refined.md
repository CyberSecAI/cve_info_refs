Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from librsvg incorrectly handling the parsing of certain SVG files. Specifically, the issue involves how the library processes specific SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect SVG Parsing:** The core issue is that the librsvg library does not properly handle specific constructions within SVG files, leading to a parsing error.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to trigger a crash in librsvg.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to the librsvg library crashing. This can result in a denial of service for applications or systems that depend on librsvg for rendering SVG images.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by an attacker.
- **Specially Crafted SVG Files:** The attack vector is via specially crafted SVG files designed to exploit the parsing flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide SVG files:**  The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SVG file to a system or application that uses the vulnerable version of librsvg. This could happen in various scenarios, such as a web server processing SVG uploads, or a user opening a malicious file received via email or web browsing.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4436-1) explicitly mentions that the vulnerability affects Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
- The provided patch on github shows a fix for a division by zero error which is not related to the CVE. This CVE is related to the parsing of certain SVG files not a division by zero in the code.
- The Debian LTS advisory (DLA-2285-1) also lists CVE-2017-11464 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed, stating it's related to "denial of service issues via exponential element processing, stack exhaustion or application crash when processing specially crafted files".

In summary, CVE-2017-11464 is a vulnerability in librsvg that allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service by providing a malicious SVG file that triggers an error during the parsing process.
