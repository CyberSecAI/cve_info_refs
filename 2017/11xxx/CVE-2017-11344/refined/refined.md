The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities in the `networkmap` component of Asus wireless routers, specifically within the `store_description` function: a global buffer overflow and a stack buffer overflow. These are distinct from CVE-2017-6548.

**1. Global Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** The `store_description` function parses device description XML and stores service URLs in the `device_info` structure. It increments a counter `s_num` without checking if it exceeds the bounds of the `description.service` array, which has a fixed size (`SERVICE_NUM = 10`).
*   **Vulnerability:** A global buffer overflow occurs when the number of service URLs in the XML exceeds the size of the `description.service` array, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions within the global `device_info` structure.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary data can be written at any address in heap, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker sends a crafted SSDP response to the router.
    2.  The router, upon receiving the SSDP response, makes an HTTP request to retrieve the device description XML from an attacker-controlled server.
    3.  The attacker's server responds with a malicious device description XML containing more service URLs than the size of the `description.service` array.
    4.  The `store_description` function attempts to store all URLs, causing an overflow on the heap.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to respond to SSDP requests and host a malicious HTTP server to deliver crafted XML content.

**2. Stack Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `store_description` function contains a `case 6` block that parses service names. This block searches for colons (`:`) in the service type string, copying the portion of the string after the third colon to a temporary buffer `tmp` on the stack. If the service type string does not contain four colons, the code will continue to read from memory until it finds a colon, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow occurs if the service type does not contain the expected number of colons, leading to the overwriting of the saved return address ($ra) on the stack.
*   **Impact:** Control of the program counter ($pc) can be gained, allowing arbitrary code execution, especially when combined with the global buffer overflow vulnerability to write shellcode to the heap.
*  **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Similar to the global overflow attack, an attacker sends a crafted SSDP response to the router.
    2.  The router makes a request to retrieve device XML from attacker-controlled server.
    3.  The attacker's server responds with malicious XML containing a serviceType element without the fourth colon.
    4. The `store_description` function processes the serviceType causing a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Similar to global buffer overflow, the attacker needs to be able to respond to SSDP requests and host a malicious HTTP server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes a Python exploit (`exp.py`) demonstrating the described vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit sets up an HTTP server to respond to requests from the router with crafted XML, and also responds to SSDP requests to initiate the attack.
*   The global buffer overflow is used to write shellcode to a known heap address.
*   The stack buffer overflow is triggered in `case 6` of the `store_description` function, overwriting the return address. This allows the attacker to gain code execution by jumping to the shellcode written on the heap.
*   The memory addresses for the program and heap are not randomized, making exploitation easier.

The identified vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve remote code execution.
