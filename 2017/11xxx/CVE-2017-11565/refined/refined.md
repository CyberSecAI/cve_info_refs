{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `debian/tor.init` script in the Debian tor package incorrectly assumes that the `aa-exec` executable will always be located at `/usr/sbin/aa-exec`. This assumption is false as the location of `aa-exec` can change between different distributions and architectures.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the `tor.init` script relying on a fixed path for `aa-exec`. When `aa-exec` is not in the expected location, AppArmor is silently disabled, which means the tor daemon will not have the intended confinement.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can bypass intended AppArmor restrictions, potentially gaining elevated privileges and performing unauthorized actions, due to the lack of confinement of the tor daemon.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited when the `tor.init` script attempts to execute `aa-exec` to enforce AppArmor confinement, but fails to do so silently if `aa-exec` is not present in `/usr/sbin/`. This is applicable to systems that do not use systemd and rely on this script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to exploit a system where Tor uses the vulnerable init script (i.e., not a system using systemd) and where `aa-exec` is not present in /usr/sbin. This usually arises due to a configuration or packaging difference in the underlying OS. The attacker does not need any special privileges besides access to the system."
