Just as additional information. This should not affect default
installations of Stretch, as in those cases with systemd as init
system, the provided unit is used.

(But needs to be double-checked).

Control: retitle -1 tor: [CVE-2017-11565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11565): aa-exec is not longer in /usr/sbin and now apparmor is silently scraped

Hi

Someone requested a CVE for the issue in the init-Skript. It got
assigned [CVE-2017-11565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11565). We do not need a DSA for it, but any fix can
either still be done either via a point release or included in a
future tor DSA.

Regards,
Salvatore

The more likely way forward is to disable apparmor support since it
breaks a number of use-cases.  It's not clear what this does to that
CVE, but *shrugs*

:/

I've tried as hard as I could to avoid this, and to resolve breakage
in a timely manner when it was identified. FTR I'm happy to keep doing
that for the foreseeable future: I'll do this work for Tails anyway,
and I'd rather do it directly in Debian than maintaining a delta. Now,
the outcome of this work is not good enough and you prefer to drop
AppArmor support, well, so be it, that's obviously your call.

I'm considering it at least.  We'll see.  (I think there's at least one
issue that came up recently that isn't in the BTS yet.  I'll file a bug
when I get around to it.)

Changes:
 tor (0.3.1.5-alpha-2) experimental; urgency=medium
 .
   * apparmor: use Pix instead of PUx for obfs4proxy, giving us
     better confinement of the child process while actually working
     with systemd's NoNewPrivileges.  (closes: #[867342](bugreport.cgi?bug=867342))
   * Do not rely on aa-exec and aa-enabled being in /usr/sbin in the
     SysV init script.  This change enables apparmor confinement
     on some system-V systems again.  (closes: #[869153](bugreport.cgi?bug=869153))

# CVE-2017-11565

| **Name** | CVE-2017-11565 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | debian/tor.init in the Debian tor\_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the apparmor package is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain the same forever), which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor restrictions by leveraging the silent loss of this protection mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init script). |
