The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in Subrion CMS version 4.1.4, specifically in the `/front/actions.php` file.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied data (`$_POST['field']`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The code directly incorporates the `$_POST['field']` value into the SQL query in `iaDb::row()` method, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the `$fileName` parameter within `deleteUploadedFile` is derived from `$_POST['field']`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:**  While not explicitly stated, time-based SQL injection is used to test, indicating that a DoS via time delay could be possible, or by executing queries that take large amounts of time or resource.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/front/actions.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `delete-file`.
*   **Malicious payload in `field` parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `field` parameter in POST data, which is incorporated into the `deleteUploadedFile()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User Account:** The vulnerability requires a registered user account to bypass the initial `checkOwnership` validation. An anonymous user is blocked from this function.
*   **Knowledge of the endpoint and parameters:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL path (`/front/actions.php`) and the parameters (`action`, `item`, `itemid`, `field`, `file`) required to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Ability to craft SQL Injection payloads** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection queries that will achieve the desired effect (e.g. exfiltration of information via time-based blind SQL injection).
