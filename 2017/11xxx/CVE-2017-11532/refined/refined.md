Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory leak within the `WriteMPCImage` function in the `coders/mpc.c` file of the ImageMagick library. This occurs during the process of writing an image in MPC format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a memory leak. The code allocates memory for pixel caches and other related data but fails to properly release it after use, resulting in a memory leak.
- Multiple memory leaks are occurring, involving `malloc` and `posix_memalign`. These leaks involve allocations for pixel data, semaphore information, and aligned memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is memory exhaustion. Repeatedly processing crafted images would lead to memory being consumed without being freed.
- This could result in degraded performance, application crashes, or denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the processing of a specially crafted image file in MPC format. An attacker can trigger the memory leak by providing a malicious MPC file to the ImageMagick convert utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted MPC file to be processed by ImageMagick, e.g. by uploading the file to a system that uses the vulnerable version of ImageMagick, or by convincing a user to process the file.
- No specific access or privilege is required for the exploit, other than the ability to execute the `convert` command with the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided report includes the stack traces of the memory allocations, confirming that the memory leak happens in the `WriteMPCImage` function, specifically during the cloning and persisting of pixel caches.
- The leak is identified by AddressSanitizer (ASan) tool, which provides details about allocated memory that is not freed, and call stacks indicating where the memory was allocated
- The issue can be triggered by running the command : `./magick convert imagemagick_output_mpc_memory_leak_WriteMPCImage output.mpc`
- This issue is reproducible with the provided PoC file `imagemagick_output_mpc_memory_leak_WriteMPCImage`.
