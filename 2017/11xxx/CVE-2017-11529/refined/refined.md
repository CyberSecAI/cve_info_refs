Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11529:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ReadMATImage` function in `mat.c` within ImageMagick has a memory leak. When processing a specially crafted MAT file, the function allocates memory but fails to release it, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unreleased memory allocations. The `ReadMATImage` function allocates memory but doesn't free it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): Attackers can cause a denial of service by repeatedly sending crafted MAT files, which will eventually lead to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted MAT file to the vulnerable `ReadMATImage` function, which is part of the ImageMagick library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply or cause the processing of a crafted MAT file by ImageMagick.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported with an example of AddressSanitizer output, showing the allocation call stack and the sizes of memory leaked.
- The vulnerability was addressed in multiple ImageMagick versions: 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-12, 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u1, and 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u10.
- The `MATLAB_HDR` field in the MAT file can be modified to cause ImageMagick to allocate arbitrary amounts of memory, accelerating the memory exhaustion.
