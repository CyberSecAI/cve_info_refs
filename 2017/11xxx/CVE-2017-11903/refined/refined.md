{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is located in the `NameTbl::GetValDef` function within jscript.dll. This function is called when an object is converted to a string. It attempts to call `toString()` or `valueOf()` methods of the `NameTbl` object, potentially multiple times, until the return value is not a JavaScript object. The core issue is that the `NameTbl` object on which these methods are called isn't explicitly tracked by the garbage collector. This allows the object to be deleted within the `toString`/`valueOf` callback, as long as it's not tracked by the garbage collector elsewhere. Thus, the `toString`/`valueOf` can effectively delete its own `this` object.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Use-after-free vulnerability in `jscript!NameTbl::GetValDef`",
      "Lack of proper tracking of NameTbl objects by the garbage collector",
     "Possibility of an object being freed during the execution of its `toString` or `valueOf` methods."
  ],
  "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The provided crash log shows an access violation due to a read from freed memory, which results in a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Malicious WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) file: An attacker can pose as a WPAD host and send a malicious wpad.dat file which contains javascript that triggers the vulnerability.",
    "Malicious web page: Opening a specially crafted web page in Internet Explorer can trigger the vulnerability."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to either serve a malicious WPAD file or host a malicious web page that is accessed by the victim. In the case of the WPAD attack, the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the victim or otherwise be able to intercept the WPAD request. For the web page attack, the victim needs to browse to the malicious page using Internet Explorer.",
  "Additional details": "The vulnerability was verified on 64-bit Windows 7 systems with the latest patches. The exploit may require the use of page heap debugging to trigger the crash reliably. The vulnerability is triggered when the javascript function `Array.prototype.join.call(vars)` is executed, after modifying a variable and calling the garbage collector. The crash occurs in `jscript!NameTbl::GetValDef` at `mov     rax,qword ptr [r14]`, where `r14` points to freed memory."
