The provided content relates to CVE-2017-11810.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `jscript.dll` library, specifically in the `jscript!JsErrorToString` function. This occurs when converting an Error object to a string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability: The 'name' property of the Error object can be freed prematurely during the conversion process due to a callback triggered by the `toString` function, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- Heap overflow: The incorrect size calculation when converting an AString object to a BString object in `AString::ConvertToBSTR` allows for copying more data than allocated causing a heap overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) crashes the application (Internet Explorer 11), indicating a denial of service. The heap overflow can also be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted HTML page viewed in Internet Explorer 11.
- Specifically, the HTML page includes a `<script>` tag with `language="Jscript.Encode"` attribute, forcing IE11 to load and use the older `jscript.dll` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page or inject the malicious code into a website.
- The user must open the attacker-controlled HTML page in Internet Explorer 11 with IE8 compatibility mode.
- The attacker has to be able to trick the user into opening their specially crafted page.
