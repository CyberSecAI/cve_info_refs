Potential Tofino Firmware Signing / Protocol Filtering Evasion /

Firewall Bypass

Date: November 6, 2017
Version: 1.0
References: CVE-2017-11400, CVE-2017-11401, CVE-2017-11402

Executive Summary

Three vulnerabilities were reported related to the Tofino, they include:

Incomplete signing of Tofino USB upgrade files

1.
2.  Protocol filtering evasion with traditional Modbus serial function codes
3.  Potential firewall bypass via OPC Enforcer

Details

1.  Tofino  USB  firmware  upgrade  packages  are  composed  of  two  files  in  an  archived  zip.  This
includes an update script called appliance_config and a *.tar.sec file. Due to the fact that only
the  appliance_config  file  is  signed,  the  .tar.sec  file  could  potentially  be  modified  and  used
during the update.

2.  An  attacker  can  send  specially  crafted  ModBus  packets  through  the  Tofino  firewall  for
traditional serial-based function codes. Even with the "sanity check" option enabled, packets
with unauthorized function codes or malformed contents may reach protected ICS equipment.
3.  An attacker can craft a false OPC dynamic port shift to trigger a firewall rule insert, which in-
turn  would  allow  an  additional  crafted  TCP  session  with  fixed  source  port  to  circumvent  the
Tofino firewall.

Impact

1.

If an attacker has physical access to the Tofino, the attacker could compromise the appliance
with a modified USB upgrade .tar.sec file.

2.  For traditional serial-based Modbus Function codes, an attacker can send malformed Modbus

3.

frames to an endpoint device.
If the Tofino contains an active OPC enforcer, an attacker can trigger a firewall hole that
permits a secondary, unrelated TCP session to be established through the firewall.

CVE-2017-11402==============
Description:------------An issue has been discovered on the Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon Security Appliance 3.10 and earlier. Design flaws in OPC classic and in custom netfilter modules allow an attacker to remotely activate rules on the firewall and to connect to any TCP port of a protected asset, thus bypassing the firewall.
Vulnerability type:-------------------Firewall bypass
Vendor of Product:------------------Belden Hirschmann
Affected Product Code Base:---------------------------Tofino Xenon Security ApplianceFirmware 3.10 and prior
Affected Component:-------------------Netfilter custom filter combined with OPC Classic DPI filter
Attack Type:------------Remote
Attack Vectors:---------------To exploit the vulnerability, someone must connect to a protected asset over OPC Classic port
