Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-11400:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Incomplete firmware signature during USB upgrades. The Tofino firmware upgrade packages consist of two files: an update script (`appliance_config`) and a `.tar.sec` file. Only the `appliance_config` file is signed, while the `.tar.sec` file is not.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Incomplete firmware signature:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `.tar.sec` file within the firmware upgrade package is not signed. This allows for potential tampering.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Compromised appliance:** An attacker with physical access can modify the unsigned `.tar.sec` file, potentially allowing them to compromise the Tofino appliance by injecting malicious code into the kernel or file system during the upgrade process.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code by modifying the unsigned firmware component.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Physical access:** An attacker needs physical access to the Tofino device.
*   **USB drive:** The attacker must be able to plug a malicious USB drive with the modified firmware upgrade package into the Tofino device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Local access:** Requires local access with the ability to connect a USB device to the Tofino appliance.
*   **Technical expertise:** Needs to modify the `.tar.sec` file with malicious content and the knowledge to craft an exploitable firmware image.

**Summary of CVE-2017-11400**
The core issue is that the Tofino device does not verify the integrity of the entire firmware package during USB upgrades, leaving it open to modification by an attacker with physical access. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device, therefore, it has been classified as a local code execution vulnerability.
