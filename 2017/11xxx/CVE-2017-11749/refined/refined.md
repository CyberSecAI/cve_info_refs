- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FTP Commander application loads external libraries using insufficiently qualified paths. Specifically, the application attempts to load `dwmapi.dll` without specifying the full path.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading (also known as DLL hijacking, DLL preloading, or Remote Binary Planting). The application does not validate the location from where the DLL is loaded.

- **Impact of exploitation**: By placing a malicious DLL named `dwmapi.dll` in a directory searched by the application, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running FTP Commander.

- **Attack vectors**: Local attack vector. An attacker needs to place a malicious `dwmapi.dll` in a location where the application will attempt to load it from. 

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs write permissions to a directory searched by the application when loading DLLs, and needs to be able to introduce a malicious DLL. The attacker also needs to convince the user to run the vulnerable application.
