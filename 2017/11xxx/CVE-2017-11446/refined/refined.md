{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ReadPESImage` function within ImageMagick. The loop termination condition `EOFBlob(image) != EOF` can never be false, because EOFBlob(image) only returns 0 or 1 and will never be -1(EOF). The second condition to break out of the loop, `if ((x == 0xff) && (y == 0))`, will never become true with a crafted input because when `ReadBlobByte(image)` reaches the end of the input, x and y will become -1. This results in an infinite loop when processing a specially crafted image file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop",
      "Lack of proper input validation",
      "Resource exhaustion"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to infinite loop consuming resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "Processing of a maliciously crafted PES image file.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to be processed by ImageMagick. "
