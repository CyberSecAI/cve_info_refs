  "CVE-2017-11368": {
    "description": "In MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.7 and later, an authenticated attacker can cause a KDC assertion failure by sending invalid S4U2Self or S4U2Proxy requests.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) does not properly handle invalid S4U2Self or S4U2Proxy requests, leading to an assertion failure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The KDC lacks proper input validation for S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy requests."
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an assertion failure in the krb5kdc process, causing it to terminate.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted, invalid S4U2Self or S4U2Proxy requests to the KDC."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with Kerberos, but no special privileges are required"
    },
    "affected_versions": "MIT krb5 versions 1.7 and later are affected.",
    "patch_details": {
      "mitigation": "The patch assigns status values when S4U2Self padata fails to decode, when invalid KDC options are used in an S4U2Proxy request, or when an S4U2Proxy request's evidence ticket doesn't match the canonicalized server principal name. If no status is assigned, the status defaults to UNKNOWN_REASON.",
