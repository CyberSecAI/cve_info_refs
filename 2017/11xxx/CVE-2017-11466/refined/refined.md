Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11466

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `fieldName` parameter in the `AjaxFileUploadServlet` of DotCMS. This parameter is used to construct the directory path where uploaded files are stored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files to the server due to the lack of proper input validation on the `fieldName` parameter.
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `fieldName` parameter to write files to arbitrary locations within the web application's directory structure.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize the filename, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions (e.g., .jsp).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious JSP webshell, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself.
- **Full System Control:** An attacker can use the webshell to execute arbitrary commands on the server, read/modify files, and install backdoors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/servlets/ajax_file_upload` endpoint.
- **`fieldName` Parameter:** The `fieldName` parameter is used to specify the upload path, allowing for path traversal.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The file to be uploaded is sent as part of multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or have similar privileges to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable DotCMS application.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the target's directory structure to place the webshell correctly.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the `doFileUpload` method of `com.dotmarketing.servlets.AjaxFileUploadServlet.class`.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerable code snippet:

```java
File tempUserFolder = new File(APILocator.getFileAssetAPI().getRealAssetPathTmpBinary() + File.separator + userId + File.separator + fieldName);
          if (!isValidPath(tempUserFolder.getCanonicalPath())) {
            throw new IOException("Invalid fileName or Path");
          }
          if (!tempUserFolder.exists()) {
            tempUserFolder.mkdirs();
          }
          File dest = new File(tempUserFolder.getAbsolutePath() + File.separator + fileName);
          if (dest.exists()) {
            dest.delete();
          }
          fileItem.write(dest);
          fileItem.delete();
```
- The `fieldName` parameter is directly appended to the base temporary directory path.
- A check is performed on the canonical path, but this check is insufficient. Attackers can bypass it using `../` sequences.
- The uploaded file is then written to the constructed path.

**POC/EXP:**

The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:

1.  Log in as administrator
2.  Send a POST request to `/servlets/ajax_file_upload` with `fieldName=../`.
3.  Include a multipart form data with a JSP file (e.g. `test.jsp`) containing malicious code.
4. The shell is then accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/assets/tmp_upload/test.jsp` or if `fieldName` is empty `http://<host>:<port>/assets/tmp_upload/dotcms.org.1/test.jsp`

This analysis provides a complete picture of the vulnerability, its technical details, and the steps to exploit it, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
