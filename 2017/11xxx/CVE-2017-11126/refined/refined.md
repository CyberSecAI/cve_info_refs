Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `III_i_stereo` function within `layer3.c` of the mpg123 library. This overflow occurs when processing specially crafted MP3 files using intensity stereo.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The `III_i_stereo` function attempts to write data outside the bounds of a global buffer called `pow2_1`. Specifically, it reads data from before the start of the `pow2_1` array, which is located at 0x7f01025c5cc0, when the crash occurs at address 0x7f01025c5cbc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The primary observed impact is a crash of the mpg123 application when compiled with AddressSanitizer (ASan), a memory error detector.
- **Memory Corruption:** While not directly causing a crash under normal circumstances, the overflow leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes to adjacent memory locations (global variables `pow1_1` and `pow2_1`). This could potentially corrupt program state. According to the openwall discussion, it could lead to "some bad values from adjacent data being used in numerical computation."
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution (Unlikely):** While not explicitly stated or observed in the provided information, global buffer overflows can sometimes be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution if the overflow can overwrite important data like function pointers etc. However, this does not appear to be the case.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious MP3 File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP3 file.
- **Intensity Stereo Code Path:** The specific code path used for intensity stereo needs to be exercised to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Malicious MP3:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable mpg123 application with a malicious MP3 file.
- **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are required for this vulnerability to be exploited, although some level of access to the affected machine (to be able to execute the binary with a crafted file) is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an out-of-bounds read, which might not trigger a crash in normal circumstances without AddressSanitizer, but it does cause memory corruption.
- The specific MP3 files that trigger this vulnerability are difficult to generate using existing encoders and are typically generated by fuzzing.
- The patch provided shifts the access point to the array to prevent the overflow by accounting for a possible negative offset.
