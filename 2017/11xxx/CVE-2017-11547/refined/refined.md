The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in TiMidity++ version 2.14.0, including one that is relevant to CVE-2017-11547.

**Vulnerability:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `resample_gauss` function.

*   **Root Cause:** The `resample_gauss` function in `resample.c` does not properly handle crafted MIDI files, leading to an out-of-bounds write during the resampling process.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service (application crash).
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Processing a specially crafted MIDI file.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to provide the application with a malicious MIDI file.
