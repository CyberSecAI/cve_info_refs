The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11131.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application directly hashes the user password with SHA512 and uses only the first 32 bytes instead of using a key derivation function like PBKDF2 to create the password for authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure password hashing: Using SHA512 directly on the password without a key derivation function and truncating the output makes the password susceptible to attacks such as rainbow table attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Password compromise: An attacker could potentially compromise user passwords by leveraging the weak hashing function.

**Attack vectors:**
- Rainbow table attacks: An attacker could precompute hashes for common passwords and use them to crack the user passwords stored in the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the hashed password: An attacker would need access to the stored password hashes, which could be obtained from a compromised database or through other means.
