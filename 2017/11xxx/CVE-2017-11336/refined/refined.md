The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11336.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `Exiv2::Image::byteSwap4` function within the exiv2 library. This function reads 4 bytes from a buffer, and if the offset is near the end of the buffer, it can read past the end of the allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The `byteSwap4` function reads 4 bytes from a provided buffer using an offset. If the offset is set near the end of the buffer, the function will attempt to read past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap overflow results in a crash. The provided ASAN output shows a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
- It can lead to denial of service due to the crash.
- There may be potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled, however, this is not specified in the provided content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted image file that is processed by exiv2 using the command line tool `exiv2`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file (e.g., POC2 or POC32) that will be processed by exiv2. This input file likely has a specific structure that causes the `byteSwap4` to read out of bounds.
- The attacker would need the ability to execute the exiv2 binary on the target system.
