Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-11224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Acrobat and Reader handle the `loadXML` method within XFA (XML Forms Architecture) forms.
- The application fails to properly validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free: The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where the application attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This means the attacker can gain control of the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted XFA form that triggers the vulnerability.
- Malicious Web Page: An attacker can host a malicious web page that, when visited, exploits the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: The user must open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page to trigger the vulnerability.
- Remote: The attack can be initiated remotely, meaning the attacker doesn't need physical access to the victim's machine.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported anonymously through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe has released a security update to address this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-11224 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat and Reader's handling of XFA `loadXML` that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
