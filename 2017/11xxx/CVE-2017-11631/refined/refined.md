The content is related to CVE-2017-11631.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation for the `$_GET['stat']` and `$_GET['id']` variables in the `dapur/app/app_user/controller/status.php` file. These variables are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability. Malicious SQL code can be injected via the `stat` and `id` GET parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive data, modify the database, or perform other malicious actions.
- The provided examples demonstrate attackers can cause a response delay via the `sleep()` function and extract the database username, suggesting the possibility of more severe data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious GET requests to the vulnerable script with specifically crafted SQL payloads in the `stat` and `id` parameters.
- Lack of Authentication: This vulnerability does not require user authentication, allowing unauthenticated attackers to exploit it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: Attackers need network access to the vulnerable web application.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection: Attackers must understand SQL syntax to craft effective payloads.
- No user login is required to exploit the vulnerability.
