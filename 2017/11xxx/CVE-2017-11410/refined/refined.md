Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an infinite loop within the WBXML dissector of Wireshark. This occurs when processing malformed WBXML packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The WBXML dissector has a flaw that can lead to an infinite loop when handling specially crafted or malformed packets.
- **Dissection Engine Flaw:** The vulnerability lies within the libwireshark dissection engine, specifically the WBXML dissector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Excessive CPU Consumption:** Successful exploitation results in Wireshark consuming excessive CPU resources.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By forcing Wireshark into an infinite loop, an attacker can effectively cause a denial-of-service condition, making the application unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Network Packets:** An attacker can inject a malformed WBXML packet onto the network. If a user captures and analyzes that packet with Wireshark, it can trigger the infinite loop.
- **Malformed Packet Trace Files:** An attacker can create a malicious packet trace file containing a malformed WBXML packet. If a user opens the malicious capture file with Wireshark, the same vulnerability will be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access (for packet injection):** An attacker needs the ability to inject packets into the network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Ability to create/modify trace files (for malicious captures):** An attacker can create or modify a capture file containing a malicious WBXML packet.
- **User Interaction (for capture file exploitation):** The attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious capture file to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.7 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.13.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Otto Airamo and Antti Levom√§ki of Forcepoint.
- The issue is tracked in Wireshark issues #13477 and #13796.
- Fixed versions are 2.2.8 and 2.0.14 or later.
