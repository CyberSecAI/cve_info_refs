## Details

### Description

The WBXML dissector could go into an infinite loop.
Discovered by Otto Airamo and Antti Levomäki, Forcepoint.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark

consume excessive CPU resources
by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or
by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 2.2.8, 2.0.14 or later.

## Update: July 18, 2017

Updated for Wireshark 2.2.8 and 2.0.14. Added bug 13796.
