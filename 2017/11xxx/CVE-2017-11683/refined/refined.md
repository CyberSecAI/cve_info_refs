Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a reachable assertion failure in the `Exiv2::Internal::TiffReader::visitDirectory` function within `tiffvisitor.cpp`. This assertion is triggered when the `TiffCreator::create` method returns a null pointer, indicating that a required component is not configured in the TIFF structure table.
- Specifically, the code iterates through TIFF directory entries, and if an entry's tag doesn't correspond to a known component, `TiffCreator::create` fails, leading to the assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Assertion Failure:** The core weakness is that the code relies on an assertion (`assert(tc.get())`) which, when triggered, leads to a program termination (crash).
- **Unvalidated TIFF Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a crafted TIFF file that contains unknown or invalid TIFF tags that exiv2 is unable to process correctly. The application is not handling these invalid tags gracefully.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash results in a denial of service, as the application processing the crafted TIFF image will terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image file containing invalid or unknown TIFF tags that trigger the assertion failure during metadata processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed TIFF file to a vulnerable application that uses the affected `exiv2` library.
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided Red Hat Bugzilla entry and Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3852-1) both confirm that this is a denial-of-service vulnerability due to an assertion failure.
- The bug report includes a crash log and source code snippet that shows the precise location of the assertion.
- The fix was addressed in exiv2 version 0.27.0-1.el7_6 for Red Hat and in patched packages for Ubuntu as well.
- Debian LTS also released an update (DLA 3186-1) to address this and other related vulnerabilities.
- The issue is also tracked upstream: <http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1307> and <https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/57>
