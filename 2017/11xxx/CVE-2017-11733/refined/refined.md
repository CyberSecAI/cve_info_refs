Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-11733:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference exists in the `stackswap` function located in `util/decompile.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is null, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability causes the application to crash when processing a crafted file.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted SWF file to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted SWF file to an application using the vulnerable libming library.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Ming versions 0.4.8 and earlier.
- The vulnerable function is `stackswap` within the `decompile.c` file.
- The crash occurs during a read memory access at address 0x0, which is a common indication of a null pointer dereference.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when using the `swftocxx` tool in libming.
- The `libming` library is used for generating and processing Macromedia Flash files (.swf).
