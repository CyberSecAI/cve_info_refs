The provided content is a blog post detailing multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS. While it lists CVE-2017-11200, it does not provide any specific information about it. However, it does provide information on other CVEs.

The blog post outlines the following vulnerabilities:

1.  **Reflected XSS in `get_image.php`**
    *   **Root cause:** The `$_POST['id']`, `$_POST['name']`, and `$_GET['folder']` parameters in `/application/lib/ajax/get_image.php` are not validated, sanitized, or output encoded.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding, leading to reflected XSS.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint including malicious JavaScript in the mentioned parameters.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.

2.  **Arbitrary File Modification**
    *   **Root cause:** The file modification function allows modification of the filename, leading to arbitrary file modification. Vulnerable files include `/appalication/core/controller/style.php`, `/appalication/core/model/style.php`, and `/appalication/core/model/script.php`.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate file name validation allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can modify existing files, potentially gaining shell access or compromising the website.
    *  **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoints, specifying an existing file with malicious content.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the application.

3.  **Authenticated SQL Injection**
    *   **Root cause:** The `visitor_ip` parameter in `/application/core/controller/excludes.php` is inserted into the database without sanitization or output encoding. Additionally, `/stat/get_stat_data.php` executes unsanitized SQL queries.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization when inserting data into the database, allowing SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject SQL code, potentially allowing them to read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain control of the server.
    *   **Attack vector:**  The attacker must send a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious `visitor_ip` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint. Viewing the `/stat/get_stat_data.php` will execute the injected SQL query.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the application.

4.  **Stored XSS in `images.php`**
    *   **Root cause:** The filetype of uploaded images is stored without validation. When viewing image details, this filetype is output without sanitization or encoding.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of sanitization and encoding on image file type allows Stored XSS.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the image filetype, which will then be executed when other users view the image details, potentially leading to session hijacking or defacement.
    *   **Attack vector:** The attacker needs to upload an image and then modify its file type with malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to upload images and then edit them. This likely requires admin access.

5.  **Stored XSS in `visitors.php`**
    *  **Root cause:** The visited URL is stored and then output to the page without sanitization or encoding.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output sanitization and encoding allows stored XSS.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the visitor URL, which will then be executed when other users (typically admins) view the visitor logs, potentially leading to session hijacking or defacement.
    *   **Attack vector:** The attacker needs to visit the page with malicious JavaScript code in the URL.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to visit pages within the application.
