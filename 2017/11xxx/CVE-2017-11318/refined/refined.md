{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Cobian Backup 11 client does not authenticate the server it connects to, allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof the master server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of server authentication.",
      "Unencrypted communication protocol.",
       "The client blindly trusts the server it connects to, without verifying its identity.",
       "The use of pre and post backup event allows execution of arbitrary commands."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on client machines by injecting malicious backup tasks and execute them by spoofing the master server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Network traffic interception."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the network path between a Cobian Backup client and its server to perform a man-in-the-middle attack."
  },
    "additional_details": "The client sends the server password which is reversible. The client uses a simple ping-pong mechanism with the server to maintain the connection. The client receives tasks from the server, which can include commands through pre and post backup events.",
