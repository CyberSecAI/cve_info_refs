Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the "add printer" option of CyberArk Viewfinity. Specifically, the "browse" functionality when adding a network printer allows a user to navigate to and execute arbitrary files, including `cmd.exe`, instead of selecting a network printer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Input Validation/Path Traversal:** The "browse" dialog within the "add printer" functionality doesn't restrict the user to only selecting network printers, allowing the selection of arbitrary files on the local file system.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** By navigating to `C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe` using the file browser, a low-privilege user can execute a command prompt with elevated (administrator) privileges. This is because the file browser and associated processes used by Viewfinity are run with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** A standard user can gain administrative privileges on the local machine.
-   **Complete System Compromise:** Once a low privilege user has admin access, they can potentially install malware, access sensitive data, or otherwise compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where CyberArk Viewfinity is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Low Privilege User Account:** The attacker only needs a standard user account on the target system.
-   **Access to Viewfinity Control Panel:** The attacker must have the ability to interact with the Viewfinity Control Panel which is usually available to all users with the software installed.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific steps to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Affected Versions:** CyberArk Viewfinity version 5.5 (specifically 5.5.10.95) is vulnerable. It's suspected that versions prior to 6.1.1.220 may also be vulnerable but this has not been tested.
-   **Patch Information:** The vulnerability is addressed in agent version 6.1.1.220.
-   **Proof of Concept:** The provided information includes a detailed step-by-step guide of how to exploit this vulnerability.
