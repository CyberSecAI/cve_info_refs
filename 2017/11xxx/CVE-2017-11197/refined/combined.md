# Exploit Title: Privilege Escalation via CyberArk Viewfinity <= 5.5 (5.5.10.95)
# Date: Found June 2017
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.cyberark.com/
# Version: Viewfinity version 5.5 (5.5.10.95)
# Exploit Author: Eric Guillen aka geoda
# Contact: https://twitter.com/ericsguillen
# Website: https://geodasecurity.blogspot.com/
# Tested on: Windows 7 and Windows 10
# CVE: CVE-2017-11197
# Category: Privilege Escalation

1. Description

Viewfinity allows the business to "effectively minimize local administrator privileges and control applications on endpoints and servers"

This vulnerability allows a low privilege user to escalate to an administrative user via a bug within the Viewfinity "add printer" option.

2. Proof of Concept

First, verify you are a low privilege user by running the command "net session" in a CMD prompt. Net session displays information about all sessions with the local computer. The user will get Access is denied if they do not have Administrative privileges.

1. On the system tray, right click on Viewfinity and "Open Viewfinity Control Panel..."
2. Click "Add Printer"
3. Click "Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer"
4. Click "The printer that I want isn't listed"
5. Click "Select a shared printer by name"
6. Click the "Browse..." icon
7. Directly in the browser window, search for "C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe" and press <Enter>
8. This will spawn a new CMD prompt. Verify you are now Administrator by typing in "net session"

3. Solution

Vendor has been notified of this vulnerability and has been addressed in the agent v6.1.1.220. Although untested, this vulnerability could be present prior to v6.1.1.220

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

The Challenge

Local administrator accounts on Windows endpoints represent a large and frequently
exploited attack surface, but removing these administrative privileges from business users
can be a painful process, at best. As privileges are taken away, organizations are able to
reduce the attack surface, but this is often at the expense of preventing business users from
carrying out certain day-to-day tasks, resulting in lost productivity and a significant spike in
help desk calls. Complicating matters, if organizations are able to remove local
administrative privileges but neglect to control which applications may run, Windows
devices can still be vulnerable to malware that does not require privileges to execute. Once
attackers gain access to the organization through a Windows endpoint, they can then easily
use that position to jump to Windows Servers. Without complementary least privilege and
access controls for Windows administrators, organizations can be left completely
defenseless to advanced attackers.

To reduce the attack surface and mitigate the risk of a serious data breach without halting
the business or overwhelming IT teams, organizations should implement tools that
effectively enforce least privileges for business and administrative users, as well as controls
what applications are allowed to run. Without such tools in place, organizations will face
the following challenges:

 §

Lost business productivity. When
organizations eliminate all privileges from
business users, users may no longer be
able to carry out certain tasks or use
certain applications needed for their
day-to-day roles. As a result, inflexible
privilege policies can bring the business
to a halt.

 § High help desk costs. When IT policies
prevent business users from carrying out
day-to-day tasks, their first call is to the
help desk. As a result, any global policy
change that revokes necessary
permissions or access will lead to a
major influx of help desk calls, driving up
IT costs and overwhelming the support
team.

 §

Increased security risks due to
‘privilege creep.’ Without flexible
policies, organizations must either entirely
revoke privileges from business users or
provide full local administrator rights. In
this all or nothing situation, as IT teams
allow privileges for specific tasks, these
elevated privileged are often never
revoked. This ‘privilege creep’ reopens the
security loophole associated with
excessive administrator rights and makes
the organization more vulnerable to
threats.

 §

Increased risk of successful
malware-based attacks. By simply
eliminating local administrator privileges

on Windows machines, organizations
remain vulnerable to malware that does
not need privileges to run. Without
complementary tools in place to control
which applications are permitted to run,
attackers can successfully use malware-
based attacks to gain a foothold into the
organization.

The Solution

CyberArk Viewfinity enables organizations to
remove local administrator privileges and
control applications on Windows endpoints
to reduce the attack surface without halting
business user productivity or overwhelming
IT teams. The solution helps organizations
eliminate local administrator privileges while
seamlessly elevating privileges as needed for
business purposes. It also delivers application
controls that are designed to manage and
control which applications are permitted to
run to prevent malicious applications from
penetrating the environment. With CyberArk
Viewfinity, organizations are able to:

 § Automatically create policies based
on business requirements. CyberArk
Viewfinity automatically creates privilege
elevation and application control policies
based on Trusted Sources such as SCCM,
software distributors, updaters and more.

 §

Prevent malicious applications from
running in the environment. CyberArk

Effectively minimize local
administrator privileges
and control applications on
Windows endpoints.

View all privilege policies, applications and
application reputations in a single location..

Why CyberArk?

CyberArk is the trusted expert in
helping organizations stop the
most critical cyber-attacks before
they stop business.

Viewfinity

 §

 §

 §

 §

Viewfinity checks untrusted applications in
the environment against an inventory of
known malicious files, and any files deemed
malicious can be blocked from executing.

Enable unknown applications to safely
run in a restricted mode. Unknown
applications, which are neither trusted nor
known to be malicious, can be permitted to
run in ‘Restricted Mode.’ Business users may
use these applications, but the restricted
mode prevents these applications from
accessing any corporates resources,
sensitive data or the internet.

Leverage integrations with threat
detection tools to analyze unknown
applications. CyberArk Viewfinity can send
unknown applications to Check Point,
FireEye and Palo Alto Networks solutions for
automated file analysis. The threat detection
solutions return file reputation ratings, and IT
teams can use this information to decide
whether to block or permit the applications
within the environment.

Identify the all instances of malware in
the environment. Using a kernel-based
agent on each protected Windows machine,
the solution can immediately locate all
instances of a malicious application within
the environment as well the origin of each
malicious application.

Enforce granular least privilege policies
for Windows administrators. CyberArk
Viewfinity enables security teams to
granularly control which commands and
tasks each Windows Server administrator is
permit to execute based on role.

Benefits

CyberArk Viewfinity enables organizations to
reduce the Windows attack surface while
keeping business users and IT teams productive.
The solution enables organizations to:

 § Accelerate time-to-value. Minimize

time-consuming, manual IT effort by using
‘Trusted Sources’ to automate the creation of
privilege policies for over 90 percent of
applications within the organization.

 § Quickly identity and block malicious
applications. Automatically compare
unknown applications to commercially
available blacklist databases, such as
VirusTotal and NSRL, to quickly identify
known malware, and update global policies
to prevent these applications from running
in the environment.

 § Mitigate the risk of malware-based

attacks. Proactively prevent attackers from
using malware to gain a foothold into the IT
environment by controlling which
applications are permitted to run and which
resources each application is permitted to
access.

 § Keep business users productive without
compromising security. Enable business
users to run unknown applications as
needed to stay productive, but prevent those
applications from accessing corporate data
and resources to minimize any potential
damage.

 §

Leverage existing investments to quickly
and accurately detect threats. Accelerate
the analysis of unknown applications by
using Check Point, FireEye and Palo Alto
Network sandboxing tools to automatically
analyze and detect potential threats.

 § Accelerate the remediation of threats.
Quickly understand the severity of threats
and accelerate remediation efforts by
gaining clear insight into the scope and
origin of malicious applications within the IT
environment.

 § Reduce the risk of insider threats.

Prevent accidental and intentional damage
to critical Windows Servers by granularly
controlling Windows administrator privileges.

A Comprehensive Solution

CyberArk Viewfinity is part of the CyberArk
Privileged Account Security Solution, a complete
solution designed to proactively protect against
advanced attacks the exploit administrative
privileges to gain access to the heart of the
enterprise, steal sensitive data and damage
critical systems. The solution helps organizations
reduce the attack surface by eliminating
unnecessary local administrator privileges and
