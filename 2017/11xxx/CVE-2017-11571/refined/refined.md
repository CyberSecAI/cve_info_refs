Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11571:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `addnibble` function within `parsettf.c` of the FontForge software.

**Vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when writing to a buffer in the `addnibble` function, specifically within the `readcffthing` function call stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) by exploiting this buffer overflow.
- There's also a potential for arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided content, the Debian Security Advisory mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves opening a specially crafted OpenType font file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a malicious OpenType font file.
- They need to trick a user into opening the malicious font file using FontForge.

**Technical Details:**
- The crash log shows that the overflow happens when writing to address `0x7ffee637ea32` within the stack frame of `readcffthing` which calls `addnibble`.
- The overflowed buffer `buffer` is located in the stack with a size of 82 bytes, and an attempt to write a single byte past the end of the buffer triggers the error.
- The call stack shows that the vulnerability is triggered when processing a CFF (Compact Font Format) table within the TTF (TrueType Font) file. Specifically the `addnibble`, `readcffthing`, `readcfftopdict`, `readcfftopdicts`, `readcffglyphs` and finally `readttf` functions are in the stack before the `_SFReadTTF` function, this means that the `readcff*` functions are used to parse the font file before the `_SFReadTTF` function.

**Additional Information:**
- A test case (PoC) file is available at the provided URL: `<https://github.com/gnehsoah/poc/blob/master/fontforge/addnibble-in-parsettf.c-stack-buffer-overflow.otf>`
- The vulnerability was addressed in Debian by upgrading the package version: `20120731.b-5+deb8u1` for oldstable (jessie) and `1:20161005~dfsg-4+deb9u1` for stable (stretch).

This analysis provides more detail than the basic CVE description, as it includes the specific function, file, and call stack involved in the vulnerability, along with the exploit vector and impact.
