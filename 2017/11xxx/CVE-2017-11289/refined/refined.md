- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input validation vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure
- **Attack vectors**: Reflected XSS attacks
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts through input fields, which are reflected back to the user, potentially leading to information disclosure.
