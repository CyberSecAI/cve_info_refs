Changing version to '27'.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1471786#c3)  Aurelien Bompard    2017-08-17 15:29:54 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1482332](show_bug.cgi?id=1482332 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - There is a stack-overflow in parser.cpp of libsass.") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1471786#c4)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 18:28:11 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1471786#c5)  Ben Cotton    2022-07-11 19:33:47 UTC  ``` It appears this bug was missed in the EOL closure for F27 on 2018-11-30. If this bug still exists on supported versions, please reopen and update the version. If you cannot update the version, please needinfo the assignee.   ``` |  |
