- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow in the `Parser::advanceToNextToken()` function within the libsass library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The stack overflow can lead to a crash (segmentation fault) and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a crafted input to the `sassc` tool that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute the `sassc` tool with a crafted input file. The provided POC file `POC4` triggers the vulnerability.
