{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `Array.sort` function in jscript.dll uses `JsArrayStringHeapSort` or `JsArrayFunctionHeapSort` for sorting, which allocate buffers based on the number of elements. A heap overflow can occur if the number of elements increases during array population.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap Overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code within a webpage that triggers the vulnerable sort function in the jscript.dll.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript on the target system, typically by tricking a user into opening a malicious webpage."
