Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `nt!NtQueryObject` syscall handler within the Windows kernel. Specifically, when called with the `ObjectNameInformation` class and a file object associated with a local disk file, the handler discloses uninitialized pool memory if the provided output buffer is too small to hold the volume device name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Kernel Pool Memory Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of uninitialized kernel pool memory. This occurs when the provided buffer to `NtQueryObject` is too small but still larger than a minimal size.
- **Incorrect Buffer Size Handling:** The `NtQueryObject` handler doesn't properly handle cases where the provided buffer is too small to contain the required data, leading to the memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leak uninitialized kernel pool memory, which might contain sensitive data, including:
  -  Secrets stored in the kernel address space.
  -  Potentially, data related to other kernel operations.
- **Bypass of Kernel Mitigations:** By repeatedly triggering the vulnerability and leaking kernel memory addresses, attackers can potentially defeat certain exploit mitigations like Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR). This can facilitate further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally by any authenticated user.
- **System Call:** Exploitation involves making a specific `NtQueryObject` syscall with carefully crafted parameters.
  - The target object must be a file object associated with a file on a local disk.
  - The `ObjectNameInformation` information class must be used.
  - The output buffer must be smaller than the required size but larger than a minimal size (8 bytes on 32 bit, 16 bytes on 64 bit).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute code and make system calls.
- **Knowledge of Affected API:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `NtQueryObject` system call, including the proper parameters.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

The provided content gives a much more detailed account than what is typically found in a CVE description. Specifically, it describes:

-  **Specific conditions** that trigger the vulnerability.
-  The **different behaviors** of the `NtQueryObject` call based on buffer size.
-  The **exact memory regions** that are leaked.
- The range of bytes that are leaked ( between 1 and about 56 bytes).
-  The fact that repeated calls disclose new pool allocations
-  A **proof-of-concept (PoC)** code demonstrating the vulnerability.
-  Specific versions of Windows known to be affected (Windows 7 32 and 64 bit builds).

The content provides significantly more technical information than a typical CVE description would, making it valuable for understanding the vulnerability and developing mitigations.
