## Description

[![@Framartin](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1850174?u=91c5025161b242fa4d512b777339c5460eecd4a9&v=4&size=48)](/Framartin)[Framartin](https://github.com/Framartin)opened [on Mar 4, 2017](https://github.com/volca/markdown-preview/issues/60#issue-211916173)

Markdown Preview Plus makes Chrome/Chromium vulnerable to XSS attacks on files that are not designed to be interpreted by web applications.

## How to reproduce

1. An malicious user creates a txt file (or another format supported by Markdown Preview Plus) with the following content: `<script>alert(0)</script>`
2. He uploads it on a remove server using a web application
3. If the web application allows the opening of txt files in the browser, Markdown Preview Plus is a vector for XSS attacks, because the JS payload will be executed

This behavior makes all users of Markdown Preview Plus vulnerable to XSS attacks in a lot of web sites, because these websites are not designed to escape or force the download of txt files.

## How to fix

Markdown Preview Plus should sanitize the content in order to avoid XSS.
