The provided content relates to CVE-2017-11593.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Markdown Preview Plus Chrome/Chromium extension was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks because it did not sanitize the content of files before rendering them as HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of sanitization of user-provided content.
- Improper handling of files not intended to be interpreted as web content (e.g. txt files).
- Execution of Javascript code embedded within markdown content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the web application where the Markdown Preview Plus is used.
- Potential for malicious actions like data theft, session hijacking, and defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user creates a file (e.g., a text file) containing a JavaScript payload (e.g., `<script>alert(0)</script>`).
- The malicious user uploads the file to a server accessible through a web application.
- If the web application allows opening the uploaded file directly in the browser, the Markdown Preview Plus extension would render the file, and execute the JavaScript payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and upload files to a web server.
- The web application needs to open the uploaded file directly in the browser using the markdown-preview extension.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #60 of the `volca/markdown-preview` repository.
- The fix for the vulnerability was implemented by enabling sanitization in the markdown parsing process. The commit `1181f044a5457d5e1ac35804ecd84e05977f1920` introduced the fix by setting the `sanitize` option to `true` in the markdown parsing configuration and disabling it only when MathJax typesetting is enabled.
