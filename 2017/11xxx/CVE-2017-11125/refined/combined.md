| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1470073#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-07-12 11:27:59 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1470073#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-07-12 11:28:04 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1470070  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1470073#c2)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:20:02 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '25'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 25 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1470073#c3)  Jan Kurik    2018-05-31 07:44:14 UTC  ``` This bug has been reported against a Fedora version which is already unsuported. In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.  [1] <https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1736>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1470073#c4)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 15:22:40 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.

Version : 1.8.0.417.1
Release : 1.fc30

Summary : The eXtensible ARchiver
Description :
The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format. Important
design decisions include an easily extensible XML table of contents for random
access to archived files, storing the toc at the beginning of the archive to
allow for efficient handling of streamed archives, the ability to handle files
of arbitrarily large sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings for
individual files in the archive, the ability to store checksums for individual
files in both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query the
table of content's rich meta-data.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=654486#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-17 23:46:13 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected Fedora versions.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When creating a Bodhi update request, please include the bug IDs of the respective parent bugs filed against the "Security Response" product. Please mention CVE ids in the RPM changelog when available.  Bodhi update submission link: <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/new/?type_=security&bugs=654485>  Please note: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. Only one tracking bug has been filed; please only close it when all affected versions are fixed.   [bug automatically created by: add-tracking-bugs]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=654486#c1)  Fedora End Of Life    2012-08-16 16:49:12 UTC  ``` This message is a notice that Fedora 14 is now at end of life. Fedora  has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 14. It is  Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no  longer maintained.  At this time, all open bugs with a Fedora 'version' of '14' have been closed as WONTFIX.  (Please note: Our normal process is to give advanced warning of this  occurring, but we forgot to do that. A thousand apologies.)  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, feel free to reopen  this bug and simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we were unable to fix it before Fedora 14 reached end of life. If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on  "Clone This Bug" (top right of this page) and open it against that  version of Fedora.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=654486#c2)  Mosaab Alzoubi    2020-01-25 03:45:50 UTC  ``` Fixing:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-edf53cd770> <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-bbd24dd0cf>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=654486#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-01-26 01:52:05 UTC  ``` xar-1.8.0.417.1-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.

Name : xar
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.8.0.417.1
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <https://opensource.apple.com/source/xar>
Summary : The eXtensible ARchiver
Description :
The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format. Important
design decisions include an easily extensible XML table of contents for random
access to archived files, storing the toc at the beginning of the archive to
allow for efficient handling of streamed archives, the ability to handle files
of arbitrarily large sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings for
individual files in the archive, the ability to store checksums for individual
files in both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query the
table of content's rich meta-data.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1629651#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-09-17 09:08:59 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1629651#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-09-17 09:09:02 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1629650,1629651  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1629651#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 20:55:28 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1629651#c3)  Mosaab Alzoubi    2020-01-25 03:46:01 UTC  ``` Fixing:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-edf53cd770> <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-bbd24dd0cf>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1629651#c4)  Fedora Update System    2020-01-26 01:52:07 UTC  ``` xar-1.8.0.417.1-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.
