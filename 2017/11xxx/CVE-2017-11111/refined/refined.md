Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11111:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `preproc.c` file of the NASM assembler tool. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs at line 3849 of the `preproc.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to an incorrect calculation or handling of buffer size when concatenating token texts.
- The `strcpy` function is used to copy token text into a buffer without proper bounds checking. The size of allocated buffer is determined by strlen, which does not take into account subsequent token strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted source file can trigger the vulnerability when processed by the NASM assembler.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a user or automated system into processing a malicious source file with NASM.

**More Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `strcpy` operation in the `while` loop at line 3849 of `preproc.c`. The allocated buffer size (`len + 1`) is calculated based on the initial token's text length and does not account for the length of subsequent tokens' text within the loop. This causes the `strcpy` operation to write past the allocated memory boundary, resulting in a heap buffer overflow when copying the text of subsequent tokens.
- The vulnerability was detected using a custom fuzzer called collAFL.
- A patch has been created to address this issue and is available in the bugzilla report.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201903-19) and Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3694-1) both reference CVE-2017-11111.

In summary, a heap buffer overflow in NASM's preprocessor allows a malicious attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. This is achieved by feeding NASM a crafted source file.
