# NASM: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201903-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in NASM, the worst of
which could result in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/nasm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.14.02** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.14.02** |

### Background

NASM is a 80x86 assembler that has been created for portability and

CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service condition or execute
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

# USN-3694-1: NASM vulnerabilities

28 June 2018

NASM could be made to crash or run programs if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [nasm](/security/cves?package=nasm) - General-purpose x86 assembler

## Details

It was discovered that NASM incorrectly handled certain source files. If a

user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted

source file, a remote attacker could use these issues to cause NASM to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [nasm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nasm)
  -
  [2.10.09-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nasm/2.10.09-1ubuntu0.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
