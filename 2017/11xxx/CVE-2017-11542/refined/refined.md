      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in tcpdump, a command-line network traffic analyzer. These vulnerabilities might result in denial of service or, potentially, execution of arbitrary code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Denial of Service (DoS)",
         "Arbitrary Code Execution"

      "impact": "A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Processing a malformed network packet."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a vulnerable system running tcpdump or a library using it. "
