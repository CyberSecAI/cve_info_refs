- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users.
- **Attack vectors**: URL fields
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that, when accessed by a Kibana user, will execute the malicious script.
