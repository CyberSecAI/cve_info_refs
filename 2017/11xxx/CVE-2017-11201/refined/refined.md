The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11201.

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root cause:**
The `$_POST['id']`, `$_POST['name']` and `$_GET['folder']` parameters in `/application/lib/ajax/get_image.php` are not validated, sanitized, or output encoded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or stealing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted URL that includes the malicious script in the `folder`, `id`, and `name` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code and trick the user to access it.
