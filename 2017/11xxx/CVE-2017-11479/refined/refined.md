  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Timelion component of Kibana.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through the Timelion component of Kibana. An attacker could exploit this XSS vulnerability by crafting a malicious input that, when processed by Timelion, leads to the execution of attacker-controlled code within the context of another Kibana user's session.",
         "This can be achieved by tricking users into visiting a crafted URL, or interacting with modified Kibana objects, where the Timelion component loads the malicious script."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious input that can be processed by Timelion. The attacker would need knowledge of how to inject scripts into Timelion. The attacker would also need to trick users into interacting with the malicous input, often through a URL."
