The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS, and CVE-2017-11202 is mentioned in the list of CVE IDs at the beginning, but it's not specifically detailed. However, the content provides a detailed explanation for a Reflected XSS vulnerability in get\_image.php. This vulnerability is likely the one assigned to CVE-2017-11202.

**Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS in `get_image.php`

*   **Root Cause:** The script `/application/lib/ajax/get_image.php` uses `$_POST['id']`, `$_POST['name']`, and `$_GET['folder']` without any sanitization, validation, or output encoding.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and output encoding, which allows injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code in the `folder` parameter as well as the `id` and `name` POST parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click a malicious link, or to craft a malicious request that includes the malicious payload, and trick the user into sending that request to the server.

**Proof of Concept:**
`http://your_finecms/application/lib/ajax/get_image.php?folder=1`
`POST: id=1"><script>alert(1)</script>&name=1`
