Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-11507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Check_MK Multisite web interface's internal server error handler displays unescaped information directly from the web server's error log.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the Apache error log, which will then be displayed to other users when they trigger an internal server error.
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `output_format` parameter is vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when the user views the internal server error page. This could be used for:
    - Stealing cookies/session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the web interface
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`output_format` Parameter:** An attacker can inject malicious code via the `output_format` parameter in the URL which leads to a stored XSS condition.
- **Failed HTTP Basic Authentication Attempts:** An attacker can include HTML/JavaScript in the username field during a failed login attempt which leads to a stored XSS condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated remote attacker.
- Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the affected Check_MK instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an internal server error occurs, which is typically caused by providing an unexpected format to the `output_format` parameter.
- The injected code is stored in the Apache error log and will be displayed to any user that views the error page, causing a stored XSS.
- The vendor addressed the issue by properly escaping output from the error log in Check_MK versions 1.2.8p25 and 1.4.0p9.
