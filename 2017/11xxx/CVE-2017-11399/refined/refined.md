Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the APE (Monkey's Audio) decoder within FFmpeg.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability occurs in the `ape_decode_frame` function in `libavcodec/apedec.c` when allocating memory for the decoded audio samples.
- Specifically, the size calculation `2 * FFALIGN(blockstodecode, 8) * sizeof(*s->decoded_buffer)` can overflow if `blockstodecode` (number of audio blocks to decode) is sufficiently large. This leads to allocating less memory than required, causing a heap buffer overflow when writing the decoded samples to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Out of array access or a heap buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Potential denial of service through a crash or other abnormal behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A crafted APE file can trigger the vulnerability when processed by FFmpeg's APE decoder.
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious APE file containing a crafted blockstodecode value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious APE file to an application using the vulnerable version of FFmpeg.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, just the ability to have the file processed by FFmpeg.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves adding a check to ensure the calculated size for memory allocation doesn't overflow, using `INT_MAX / 2 / sizeof(*s->decoded_buffer) - 8` and using a dedicated variable for decoded buffer size: `decoded_buffer_size = 2LL * FFALIGN(blockstodecode, 8) * sizeof(*s->decoded_buffer);`, as well as asserting the size is within bounds using `av_assert0(decoded_buffer_size <= INT_MAX);` .
- The vulnerability was found by Liu Bingchang of IIE.
- The fix is implemented in commit `ba4beaf6149f7241c8bd85fe853318c2f6837ad0` and cherry-picked in `96349da5ec8eda9f0368446e557fe0c8ba0e66b7`.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3957-1 addresses this vulnerability, along with others, in FFmpeg, specifying the fixed version as `7:3.2.7-1~deb9u1` for the stable distribution (stretch).
