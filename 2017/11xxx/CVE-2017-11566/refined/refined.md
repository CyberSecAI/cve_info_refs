{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Shell command injection via a proxy field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not properly sanitize user input in the proxy setting IP field, leading to command injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE) with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could perform command injection in the Appuse proxy setting IP field. The vulnerable code is executed as root on Linux systems.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same machine as the vulnerable application."
