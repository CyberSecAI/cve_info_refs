The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the FiyoCMS application. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause across all listed vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization and filtering of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries. The application directly incorporates data from `$_POST` and `$_GET` parameters into SQL statements without any validation or escaping. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs due to the lack of input sanitization.  The usage of PDO does not prevent SQL injection if the input is not properly handled.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper filters or sanitization routines on parameters taken from `$_POST` and `$_GET` arrays. Specifically, the following parameters are mentioned as being vulnerable:
    *   `$_POST['id']`, `$_POST['art_title']` in `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php`
    *   `$_POST['name']`, `$_POST['email']`, `$_POST['url']`, `$_POST['text']` in `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php`
    *   `$_GET[cat]`, `$_GET[user]`, `$_GET[level]`, `$_GET['iSortCol*'.$i]` in `dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php`
    *   `$_GET['id']` in `dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php`
    *   `$_GET['id']` in `dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php`
    *   `$_POST[parent_id]`, `$_POST[desc]`, `$_POST[keys]`, `$_POST[level]` in `dapur/apps/app_article/sys_article.php`
    *   `$_GET['id']` in `dapur/apps/app_comment/controller/comment_status.php`
    *   `$_POST[comment]`, `$_POST[name]`, `$_POST[web]`, `$_POST[email]`, `$_POST[status]`, `$_POST[id]`, `$_REQUEST['id']` in `dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data, including user information, credentials, and other confidential data.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative control over the database server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Executing queries that can overload or crash the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** Attacker crafts malicious POST requests to vulnerable endpoints, embedding SQL injection payloads within parameters such as `id`, `art_title`, `name`, `email`, `url`, `text` and others.
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers use GET requests with malicious payloads within parameters like `cat`, `user`, `level`, `iSortCol*`, and `id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL is required to craft effective SQL injection payloads.
*   **Targeted endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the URL endpoints of the vulnerable scripts and the specific parameters that are vulnerable.

**Specific examples from the content:**
The content provides concrete examples of how to exploit the SQLi vulnerabilities:

*   **Example 1:** Injecting `id=" and sleep(10)&art_title=123\` into `/apps/app_article/controller/editor.php`
*   **Example 2:** Injecting `send=true&name=1" or sleep(10) or "1&email=aaa@qq.com&url=11&text=11111&captcha=undefined&link=%3Fapp%3Darticle%26view%3Ditem%26id%3D184` into `/apps/app_comment/controller/insert.php`
*   **Example 3:** Injecting `cat='%20orsleep(10)%20or%20'1` into `/fiyo/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_list.php`
*   **Example 4:** Injecting `id=1'or'1` into `/fiyo/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/article_status.php`
*   **Example 5:** Injecting `id=1'or'1` into `/fiyo/dapur/apps/app_article/controller/comment_status.php`
*   **Example 6:** Injecting payloads in parameters such as `parent_id`, `desc`, `keys`, and `level` within the category and article handling functionality of `dapur/apps/app_article/sys_article.php`.
*   **Example 7:** Injecting `id=1'or'1` into `/fiyo/dapur/apps/app_comment/controller/comment_status.php`
*   **Example 8:** Injecting payloads in parameters such as `comment`, `name`, `web`, `email`, `status`, `id`, and also using `id` in `dapur/apps/app_comment/sys_comment.php`.

**Summary:**
The content provides detailed information about multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in FiyoCMS. The vulnerabilities are due to a widespread lack of input sanitization, which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries and perform a variety of malicious actions on the database. The content provides multiple attack vectors and specific vulnerable parameters within the application.
