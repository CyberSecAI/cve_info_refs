The provided content details two distinct crashes (read and write access violations) in Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner 8's `Reporter.exe` when processing a malformed `.pre` file.  The blog post indicates that the write access violation is likely exploitable. The post also mentions that this issue was described as CVE-2017-11674, which is a different CVE, making it UNRELATED to CVE-2017-11673.

**Case #01 - Write Access Violation:**

*   **Root cause:** A malformed `.pre` file leads to an access violation during a write operation in `reporter.exe`.
*   **Vulnerability:** Write access violation due to an out-of-bounds write
*   **Impact:**  The write AV is classified as "EXPLOITABLE" which suggests that it could be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the target system
*   **Attack vector:** Malformed `.pre` file, processed by the `Reporter.exe` application.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.pre` file to the `Reporter.exe`. This could involve tricking a user into opening the file, or by leveraging another vulnerability that allows writing to the filesystem.

**Case #02 - Read Access Violation:**

*   **Root cause:** A malformed `.pre` file leads to an access violation during a read operation in `reporter.exe`.
*   **Vulnerability:** Read access violation due to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:**  The read AV is classified as "UNKNOWN" in terms of exploitability, meaning the severity of the vulnerability is not known, but may still lead to a crash and a potential denial of service.
*   **Attack vector:** Malformed `.pre` file, processed by the `Reporter.exe` application.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.pre` file to the `Reporter.exe`. This could involve tricking a user into opening the file, or by leveraging another vulnerability that allows writing to the filesystem.
