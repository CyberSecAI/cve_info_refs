The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities in the `networkmap` service of Asus wireless routers, specifically within the `store_description` function. These are separate from CVE-2017-6548.

**1. Global Buffer Overflow:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `store_description` function parses a device description XML. It increments a counter `s_num` when handling service URLs, without any bounds check, leading to an out-of-bounds write when copying the URL into the `description.service[s_num].url` field. This overflow happens because the loop iterating through services doesn't validate if `s_num` exceeds the allocated size in the `device_info` struct.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of bounds checking on `s_num` when writing to the global `device_info` struct.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can overwrite heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a crafted SSDP response to trigger the router to download and parse a malicious device description XML file containing multiple service URLs. This can cause the overflow when the `networkmap` service processes the crafted XML.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or be able to send the crafted SSDP response to the vulnerable device.

**2. Stack Buffer Overflow:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `store_description` function contains a `case 6` that parses service type strings. It iterates through the string looking for colons (':'). If fewer than 4 colons are present, the code continues to read and copy data into a stack buffer `tmp` beyond its bounds, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper bounds checking during string parsing within the `case 6` block in `store_description`, leading to writing past the allocated buffer `tmp` on the stack.
*   **Impact:** By overflowing the `tmp` buffer on the stack, the attacker can overwrite the return address (`$ra`), leading to control of program execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a crafted SSDP response to trigger the router to download and parse a malicious device description XML file containing a crafted `serviceType` element that lacks sufficient colons.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or be able to send the crafted SSDP response to the vulnerable device.

**Combined Exploitation:**

The report indicates that the stack buffer overflow can be used in conjunction with the heap overflow. The heap overflow can be used to write shellcode into a known memory location, while the stack overflow can redirect program execution to that location. This allows for remote code execution.
