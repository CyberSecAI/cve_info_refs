Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-11391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the `modTMCSS Proxy` functionality of Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security.
*   The software fails to properly validate a user-supplied string in the "t" parameter before using it to execute a system call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of proper validation of the "t" parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   The code is executed under the context of the `imss` user, which could lead to further privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Specifically the "t" Parameter:** The malicious commands are injected via the "t" parameter of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Access:** An attacker needs to first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This is a key requirement for successful exploitation, suggesting it's not an unauthenticated remote code execution but requires initial access of some kind.
