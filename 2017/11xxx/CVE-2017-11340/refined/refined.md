Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11340:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A segmentation fault occurs in the `Exiv2::XmpParser::terminate()` function of the exiv2 library. This occurs when processing a crafted, malformed image file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The exiv2 library has a flaw in how it handles malformed image files, specifically related to parsing XMP metadata and ORF image files.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the termination phase of the XmpParser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the application to crash. This can be used for denial of service, and may have other impacts if the application is part of a bigger system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted image file (specifically an Olympus ORF file), that can be processed using the exiv2 library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted image file as input to a program that uses the vulnerable exiv2 library. This could be through a file upload, or any other means of providing file inputs.
- No special capabilities or privileges are needed to trigger the crash.

**Additional details:**
- The provided bug report includes a proof-of-concept (POC) file named "POC6", triggering the crash.
- The crash occurs after the program has finished its main logic, while exiting the application.
- The issue was fixed in `exiv2-0.27.0-1.el7_6`.
- The bug is marked as a security issue in the keywords.
- Red Hat has released a security advisory (RHSA-2019:2101) addressing this vulnerability.
