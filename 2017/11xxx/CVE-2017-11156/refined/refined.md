- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from weak permissions (0777) assigned to the `ui/dlm/btsearch` directory within Synology Download Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Insecure file system permissions (0777) on a critical directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote authenticated attacker can upload an executable to the vulnerable directory and execute it, gaining the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the NAS.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading an executable file to the insecurely permissioned directory. The method to perform the upload is unspecified.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Synology NAS.
