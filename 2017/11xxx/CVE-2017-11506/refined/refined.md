Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of TLS certificate verification by Nessus scanners or agents when establishing the initial outgoing connection to a manager (like Tenable.io). Specifically, Nessus versions 6.x before 6.11 did not validate the TLS certificate of the manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the missing TLS certificate verification. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to intercept and potentially modify communications between the Nessus scanner/agent and the manager.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
- Intercept sensitive data transmitted during the initial connection.
- Potentially inject malicious data or commands, leading to unauthorized access or control over the Nessus scanner or agent.
- Disrupt the functionality of the scanner or agent by altering communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack: An attacker positioned between the Nessus scanner/agent and the manager can intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the Nessus scanner/agent and its manager.
- The attacker must be capable of intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic (MitM capability).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Nessus versions 6.x before 6.11.
*   Tenable recommends installing Nessus on a subnet that is not Internet-addressable.
*   The fix involves updating the Nessus link command to verify the certificate for `*.tenable.com` when linking to Tenable.io.
*   CVSS v2: 5.8 (Medium), Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N
