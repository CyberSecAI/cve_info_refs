Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-11407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The MQ dissector in Wireshark contains a flaw that can lead to a crash. Specifically, the issue is related to how the dissector handles malformed packets, which can trigger a crash. The specific nature of the flaw (e.g., a buffer overflow, out-of-bounds read) is not described in detail but the Debian Security Advisory references "issues with length checks or invalid memory access in different dissectors".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness is an error in the MQ dissector's packet processing logic. This lack of proper input validation or memory handling allows a malformed packet to cause a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash. This could be used to deny service or disrupt network analysis activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network injection:** An attacker can craft a malformed MQ packet and inject it onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious pcap file:** An attacker could create a malformed packet trace file (pcap) containing a malicious MQ packet and trick a user into opening it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either inject packets into the network that Wireshark is monitoring or deliver a malicious packet capture file. No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to send or receive network traffic or to have the user open a file.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.7 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.13.
- Fixed versions are 2.2.8 and 2.0.14, or later.
- The issue was found by a buildbot during fuzzing tests.
- The Debian LTS advisory lists this CVE along with many others, indicating multiple dissectors had similar issues relating to length checks or invalid memory access.
