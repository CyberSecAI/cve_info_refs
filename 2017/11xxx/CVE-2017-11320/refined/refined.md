Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the SSID (Service Set Identifier) input field in the Technicolor TC7337 router's web interface. Specifically, when the router scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks, the SSID values are not properly encoded before being displayed in the `wlscanresults.html` page. This allows an attacker-controlled SSID to inject malicious script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the router's web interface and executed each time a user accesses the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the router's web interface within the user's browser. This enables a range of malicious actions, including:
    *   **Credentials Theft:** The attacker can steal the administrator's login credentials and Wi-Fi passwords by sending requests to the `/backupsettings.cmd` page and exfiltrating the data to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Router Reboot:** The attacker can force the router to reboot by exploiting a CSRF vulnerability to make a request to the `/rebootinfo.cgi` page.
    *  **DNS Poisoning:** The attacker can change the router's DNS settings by exploiting another CSRF vulnerability and sending requests to the `/rede-dnsv4.cgi` page, redirecting traffic through a malicious DNS server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves an attacker creating a Wi-Fi network with a malicious SSID crafted to include a JavaScript payload.
*   When a user's Technicolor TC7337 router scans for available networks, it will encounter the malicious SSID.
*   The malicious SSID, when rendered in the router's web interface on the `wlscanresults.html` page, will execute the attacker's JavaScript code when the user accesses the page.
*   The malicious JavaScript can then be used to perform the malicious actions specified by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to set up a rogue Wi-Fi network with a specially crafted SSID.
*   The attacker does not need to be directly connected to the target network or know the router's credentials initially.
*   The attacker needs a server to host the malicious JavaScript payload.

**Additional Information:**
*   The attacker is limited to a 32-byte payload for the SSID.
*   The attacker utilized a 5-character domain name (url.co) and omitted quotes around src attribute to save space and bypass limitations.
*   The exploit code provided in the disclosure demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using Javascript to exfiltrate credentials, reboot the router and poison DNS settings.
