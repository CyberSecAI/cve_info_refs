The content is related to CVE-2017-11339.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function within `image.cpp` of the exiv2 library. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs at line 404 where `std::memcpy` is used.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability is present in the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function. The `memcpy` operation copies data beyond the allocated buffer size.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash due to memory corruption, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution. In this instance, it caused a crash of the exiv2 utility.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted image file to exiv2. Specifically, a malicious crafted image which is parsed by the `printIFDStructure` function using the `memcpy`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious image file which is processed by the vulnerable exiv2 library/utility. This can be done by command-line execution of the `exiv2` binary using the crafted image, as described in the reproducer steps.
