Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-11569:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `readttfcopyrights` function within `parsettf.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code reads beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- Specifically, the overflow occurs during a read operation in `readttfcopyrights`, which is triggered when processing a specially crafted TrueType font file. The read occurs at `parsettf.c:1772`. The overflow occurs because the `strdup` (triggered by the `copy` function) allocates memory based on size read from the file, but a subsequent read operation attempts to read beyond this allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The heap buffer overflow causes a crash of the FontForge application, leading to a denial-of-service.
- Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution: Although not explicitly stated, heap overflows can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution under certain conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted TrueType font file: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted .otf font file.
- The vulnerable code is present in the `readttfcopyrights` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .otf file to a user who then opens this file with the vulnerable version of FontForge.
- The user needs to be convinced to open the malicious file.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the system.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The issue was found using AddressSanitizer, indicating that the vulnerability could be detected through automated testing.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3958-1) mentions this CVE along with other related vulnerabilities in FontForge.
- The Debian Security FAQ emphasizes that security fixes are backported to older versions of packages rather than upgrading to new major versions.
- The github issue page contains a crash report, including the full stack trace showing the vulnerable function `readttfcopyrights` at `parsettf.c:1772`
- A link to a proof-of-concept (POC) .otf file is available.
