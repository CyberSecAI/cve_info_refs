Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-11112:

**Root Cause:**
- An illegal memory access occurs within the `append_acs` function of the ncurses library. Specifically, the issue arises when a crafted input leads to an out-of-bounds memory write due to an invalid address (0xffffffffffffffff) being used as a source address. This invalid address is derived from a previously written value to `tp->Strings[409]`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to an invalid memory address being accessed in the `append_acs` function, leading to a crash. The root cause is an earlier write to a string array of the terminal capabilities (tp->Strings) with an invalid value.
- **Lack of input validation:** The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of the terminal capability data being processed by `ncurses`, allowing crafted data to cause a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Exploitation leads to a crash of applications using the ncurses library, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the Gentoo Security Advisory suggests that, in general, similar ncurses vulnerabilities can allow arbitrary code execution. Therefore, it can be inferred that this vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution under specific circumstances due to the invalid memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted terminfo data:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing malicious terminfo data through the `captoinfo` tool, which utilizes the ncurses library.
- **Processing untrusted data:** The Gentoo advisory states that a remote attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to process untrusted terminfo or other related data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted terminfo data or other malicious data to an application that uses the vulnerable ncurses library.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same machine as the vulnerable application. The data could be sent over a network or through other means, as stated by the Gentoo advisory's "remote attacker" assertion.

**Additional Details:**
- The Red Hat bug report indicates that the issue was found with ncurses version <= 6.0.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory provides a more general description of multiple vulnerabilities within ncurses, suggesting that CVE-2017-11112 is one of many.
- The vulnerability was detected using a custom fuzzer named AFL by the team OWL337.
- A fix for this was released with ncurses version 6.1 and above.
- Bug 1464686 was marked as a duplicate of bug 1473306 which was assigned the CVE-2017-11112.
