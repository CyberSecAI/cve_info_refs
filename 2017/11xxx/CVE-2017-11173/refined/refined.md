Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing end-of-string anchor (`$`) in the regular expressions generated by the `rack-cors` gem when configuring allowed origins using string parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Regular Expression Generation:** The `rack-cors` gem, specifically before version 0.4.1, incorrectly generates regular expressions for origin validation. When a string is used to define an allowed origin (e.g., 'example.com'), the generated regex lacked the end-of-string anchor (`$`). This resulted in the regex matching not just 'example.com' but also strings like 'example.com.example.net' or 'example.com-example.net'.
*   **Bypass of CORS Restrictions:** This missing anchor allowed malicious third-party sites to bypass the intended CORS restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Origin Request Forgery:** A malicious site can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user of the vulnerable domain by crafting a URL that appears similar to the legitimate one. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources or actions.
*   **Data theft or modification:** By performing unauthorized requests, the attacker can potentially steal sensitive data or modify user profiles.
*   **Compromise of user sessions:** The attacker can potentially gain control of a user's session or perform administrative actions if the user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage on a different domain (e.g., `example.com.example.net`) designed to perform CORS requests against the vulnerable domain (e.g., `example.com`).
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can use phishing techniques, employing URL shorteners to disguise the malicious domain and trick users into visiting them. For example:
    *   A user may think the url `http://t.co/xyz` links to the trusted example.com, but when expanded redirects to `example.com.example.net`.
*   **Social Engineering:** By using social engineering, attackers could convince users to click on these malicious links or visit the malicious domain directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or control the content of a website that a victim might visit.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker must have basic knowledge of web requests and CORS to create a functional exploit.
*   **Social engineering skills:** To entice users to visit the malicious URLs, they would need social engineering tactics.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `rack-cors` gem versions prior to 0.4.1.
*   The fix involves adding the end-of-string anchor `$` to the generated regular expressions.
*   Many websites were potentially affected by this issue due to the popularity of the `rack-cors` gem, according to the information from the security researcher.
*   A tool called `CORStest` was created to check for vulnerable CORS configurations at `https://github.com/RUB-NDS/CORStest`.
