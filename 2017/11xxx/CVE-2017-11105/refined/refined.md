- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OnePlus 2 device fails to properly validate the digital signature of the Secondary Bootloader (sbl1) partition during boot process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary bootloader (PBL) does not validate the sbl1 partition, allowing for a modified sbl1 to be loaded. This failure of signature validation allows for the complete subversion of the secure boot process by allowing the loading of tampered versions of other bootloader components (ABOOT, TrustZone etc).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can disable signature validation of the rest of the bootloader chain and other SBL-validated partitions, such as TrustZone and ABOOT, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code in the bootloader. This can lead to a complete compromise of the device, allowing for arbitrary code execution at the highest privilege level.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can modify the `sbl1` partition with a crafted version that disables the signature check for subsequent bootloader components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the `sbl1` partition. This likely requires physical access to the device or the ability to exploit a separate vulnerability allowing for partition modification.
