Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2017-11752:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content discusses a memory leak in ImageMagick, specifically within the `AcquireMagickMemory` function. While a memory leak may exist, it is difficult to determine if this issue is the same as CVE-2017-11752 without the official CVE description. However, there is a strong chance that it could be, given the timeframe.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a memory leak in the `AcquireMagickMemory` function within `MagickCore/memory.c`, specifically at line 464. This is evident from the `LeakSanitizer` output.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Memory Leak:** The code allocates memory using `malloc` but fails to free it properly, leading to a memory leak. Specifically, this occurs during the processing of MAGICK image files, particularly in the `ReadMAGICKImage` function.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability can exhaust available memory, eventually causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Maliciously Crafted Image File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted MAGICK image file that triggers the memory leak when processed by ImageMagick.
   - **Command Line:** As demonstrated in the provided code, the vulnerability can be triggered using the `magick convert` command with the malicious image as an input.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to be processed by ImageMagick. This could be through:
     - Uploading a file to a web server that uses ImageMagick for image processing.
     - Directly using the command line tool with a malformed image.

**Technical Details:**
   - The provided stack trace clearly identifies the sequence of function calls leading to the memory leak:
     - `malloc` (allocation)
     - `AcquireMagickMemory` (in `MagickCore/memory.c:464`)
     - `AcquireImageInfo`
     - `CloneImageInfo`
     - `ReadMAGICKImage` (in `coders/magick.c:13053`)
     - `ReadImage`
     - `ReadImages`
     - `ConvertImageCommand`
     - `MagickCommandGenesis`
     - `MagickMain`
     - `main`

**Additional Notes:**
   - The provided PoC link `https://github.com/zhouat/poc_IM/blob/master/e6aa0c45a13dd7fc94f7b5451bd89bf4.gif_output-24.magick` contains a sample image that triggers the vulnerability.
   - The issue is reported in the context of `magick convert` command.
   - The `LeakSanitizer` output shows a direct leak of 13024 bytes.

**Summary:**

The content details a memory leak vulnerability in ImageMagick's `AcquireMagickMemory` function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted MAGICK image file, causing a denial-of-service by exhausting system memory. The provided stack trace and PoC image offer insight into the technical details and attack vectors.
