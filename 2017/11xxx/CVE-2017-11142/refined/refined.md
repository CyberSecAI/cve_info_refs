  "CVE-2017-11142": {
    "Description": "In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.17, and 7.1.x before 7.1.3, remote attackers could cause a CPU consumption denial of service attack by injecting long form variables, related to main/php_variables.c.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to inefficient handling of long form variables within the php_variables.c file. When POST data with form-urlencoded key-value pairs significantly larger than the stream buffer size are sent, the implementation keeps appending to the buffer and rescanning it entirely every time, leading to quadratic time complexity.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient algorithm",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "CPU consumption"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by injecting long form variables, leading to excessive CPU consumption.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attack via HTTP POST requests"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests with large amounts of data to the vulnerable server. No authentication or specific capabilities are required."
  },
  "CVE-2017-11143": {
    "Description": "In PHP before 5.6.31, an invalid free in the WDDX deserialization of boolean parameters could be used by attackers able to inject XML for deserialization to crash the PHP interpreter, related to an invalid free for an empty boolean element in ext/wddx/wddx.c.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an invalid `free()` operation in the WDDX deserialization process when handling boolean parameters, specifically in ext/wddx/wddx.c. An empty boolean element during deserialization leads to an attempt to free memory that is not valid.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Invalid memory management",
      "Improper resource handling",
	  "Inadequate input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, by injecting malicious XML to be deserialized via WDDX, could crash the PHP interpreter, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via injection of specially crafted XML"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to inject XML for deserialization. This could be achieved if an application using PHP processes untrusted XML input using WDDX."
  },
  "CVE-2017-11144": {
    "Description": "In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises because the PEM sealing code in the openssl extension of PHP does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL sealing function. This lack of error checking, combined with a conflicting interpretation of a negative number in `ext/openssl/openssl.c` and an omission in OpenSSL documentation, can cause a crash in the PHP interpreter.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing error handling",
      "Integer interpretation conflict",
	    "Documentation omission"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by injecting data that triggers the vulnerable OpenSSL sealing function in the PHP openssl extension to crash the PHP interpreter.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via data injection to the vulnerable openssl extension functions"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply input that is processed by the vulnerable PHP openssl extension using PEM sealing. This could be done via data sent in a POST request to a web application using vulnerable PHP version."
  },
  "CVE-2017-11145": {
    "Description": "In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, lack of a bounds check in the date extension's timelib_meridian parsing code could be used by attackers able to supply date strings to leak information from the interpreter, related to an ext/date/lib/parse_date.c out-of-bounds read affecting the php_parse_date function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `timelib_meridian` parsing code within the PHP date extension. Specifically, the code does not perform a necessary bounds check while parsing date strings, which allows out-of-bounds reads in the `php_parse_date` function of `ext/date/lib/parse_date.c`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing bounds check",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
	    "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who can supply specially crafted date strings could potentially leak sensitive information from the PHP interpreter due to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via date string injection into vulnerable PHP date extension"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply date strings that are processed by the `php_parse_date` function in a vulnerable version of PHP. This could be achieved through web application input fields that utilize this functionality."
