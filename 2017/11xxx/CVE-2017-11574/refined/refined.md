{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `readcffset` function within the `parsettf.c` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing a crafted OpenType font file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service via application crash or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the heap buffer overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is by tricking a user into opening a maliciously crafted OpenType font file using FontForge.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious OpenType font file. The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the crafted file using FontForge."
