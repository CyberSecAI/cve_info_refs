The provided content relates to CVE-2017-11188.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ReadDPXImage` function within the `dpx.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, a crafted DPX image file can manipulate the `dpx.file.image_offset` value, which is an unsigned integer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `dpx.file.image_offset` value, being an unsigned integer, can be set to a large value (up to 4294967295). The code then enters a loop which iterates from the current offset until the `dpx.file.image_offset` performing `ReadBlobByte(image)` operations. When `dpx.file.image_offset` is set to a large value, this results in excessive looping and CPU usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can create a specially crafted DPX image file to cause a denial-of-service condition by exhausting the CPU resources of the system processing the image with ImageMagick. This can lead to a slowdown or complete unresponsiveness of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted DPX image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to supply the specially crafted DPX image file to the ImageMagick software.
