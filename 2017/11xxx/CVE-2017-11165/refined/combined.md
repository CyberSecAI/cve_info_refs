##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

  Threat Zone 2024 Report on #CyberThreats in the #MiddleEast !🤖🚨
  I’ve just come across BI.ZONE's comprehensive Threat Zone 2024 report, diving into the evolving cyber threat landscape in the Middle East, focusing on Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE. It examines 10 major threat clusters active between 2023 and mid-2024, grouped by their motives: hacktivism (Hyenas), financial gain (Wolves), and espionage (Werewolves).
  What’s inside?
  The report provides a detailed look at how these threat actors operate and the risks they pose to the region's digital system.
  A must-read for anyone looking to stay informed about cyber threats in the region!

  “The router in Lebanon is down.”
  Me, at 22:30 on my first on-call shift: “Wait… we have a router in Lebanon???”
  This was my baptism by fire in the world of cybersecurity. Fresh out of university, just a few weeks into my first job, I found myself troubleshooting a critical issue in a location I didn’t even know we had operations. What followed was a 36-hour odyssey of confusion, troubleshooting, and a crash course in global networks, cascading failures, and the sweet reward of eventual resolution. Oh, how I appreciated sleep after that.
  Looking back, those moments were formative. They taught me how to think under pressure, ask better questions, and learn by doing (sometimes painfully). By the end of that ordeal, I understood our network a lot better—and myself too.
  That job taught me a lot.
  • Writing cron jobs to reboot Symantec Velociraptor firewalls, sidestepping a quiet fail in the ping daemon (planned 2-minute outages > surprise 20-minute outages).
  • Witnessing the unpredictability of workplace dynamics, like the teammate who ghosted the job, leaving us all scrambling the next day.
  • And most importantly, benefitting from incredible mentorship—those nuggets of wisdom and hands-on shadowing moments that shape careers.
  I still carry those lessons with me, even now as a CISO. That first job wasn’t just my introduction to security—it was my launchpad into understanding networks, resilience, and the value of great mentors.
  So, to my fellow security professionals:
  What was your “router in Lebanon” moment?
  What made you laugh, cringe, or grow in those early days? Share your stories—I’d love to hear them.

  3 take aways from the ecrime and cybersecurity congress at Abu Dhabi.
  1. CISO-board communication is getting increasingly critical:
  The CISO panel discussion focused on CISO-board communication more than any other topic!
  2. Patch management and vulnerability mitigation are still the pain points:
  The breakout sessions focusing on this topics were a full house!
  3. The debate on AI within cybersecurity rages on!
  Is it a blessing or a curse? Is it an attackers dream or a defenders best friend?You are likely to get conflicting opinions based on whom you ask. The discussions on this topic were hot and intense.

  The Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) are at it again… 😎
  The DCU has seized 240 fraudulent websites associated with an #Egypt-based cybercrime facilitator.
  Abanoub Nady (known online as “#MRxC0DER”) developed and sold “do it yourself” phish kits and fraudulently used the brand name “#ONNX” to sell these services.
  Numerous threat actors purchased these kits and used them in widespread phishing campaigns to bypass additional security measures and break into Microsoft customer accounts.
  The fraudulent ONNX operation offers a subscription model, offering Basic, Professional, and Enterprise subscriptions, each for different tiers of access and support.
  Enterprise users can purchase ‘Unlimited VIP Support’ providing step-by-step instructions on how to successfully use the phishing kits to commit cybercrime.
  This action builds on the DCU’s strategy of disrupting the broader cybercriminal ecosystem and targeting the tools cybercriminals use to launch their attacks.
  Our goal is to protect customers by severing bad actors from the infrastructure required to operate and to deter future cybercriminal behaviour, by raising their costs.

  👉🏼APTs are specifically aimed at high-value targets, such as government entities, financial institutions, and large corporations.
  👉🏼APTs involve multiple stages, including initial intrusion, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
  👉🏼Attackers maintain long-term access to the compromised network.
  Stages of an APT Attack
  👉🏼Reconnaissance: Attackers gather information about the target to identify vulnerabilities.
  👉🏼Initial Compromise: Gaining initial access to the target network.
  👉🏼Establishing a Foothold: Installing backdoors and malware to ensure persistent access.
  👉🏼Lateral Movement: Use stolen credentials and exploit internal vulnerabilities.
  👉🏼Data Exfiltration: Extracting sensitive information from the target network.
  👉🏼Maintaining Persistence: Ensuring long-term access to the network.
  Strategies For Defending Against APTs
  👉🏼Implementing tools and techniques to detect sophisticated threats.
  👉🏼Dividing the network into segments to limit lateral movement.
  👉🏼Conducting regular audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
  👉🏼Educating employees on recognizing and responding to phishing attempts and social engineering.
  Challenges in Defending Against APTs
  👉🏼APTs use advanced techniques that can bypass traditional security measures.
  👉🏼APTs can remain undetected for long periods.
  Benefits of Effective APT Defense
  👉🏼Prevents unauthorized access and data theft.
  👉🏼Strengthens overall network security.
  👉🏼Builds trust with customers and stakeholders by demonstrating strong security practices.
  👉🏼Helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
