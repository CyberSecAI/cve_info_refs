The provided content is related to CVE-2017-11534.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory leak in the `lite_font_map` function within the `coders/wmf.c` file of ImageMagick. This function fails to free allocated memory when processing a malformed WMF (Windows Metafile) file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The `lite_font_map` function allocates memory using `AcquireString` and `CloneString` (which eventually call `malloc`), but it doesn't release this memory when an error occurs during processing the WMF file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Repeated processing of crafted WMF files with this memory leak could lead to memory exhaustion, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious file: An attacker can create a malformed WMF file which, when processed by ImageMagick, will trigger the memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted WMF file to the ImageMagick application, either directly or indirectly through a service using ImageMagick.
