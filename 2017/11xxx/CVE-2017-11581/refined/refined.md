Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in relation to CVE-2017-11581:

**CVE-2017-11581 is associated with a URL Redirector Abuse vulnerability in FineCMS before v5.0.9.**

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/Weixin.php` file, within the `sync` function.
- This function lacks proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `url` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted URL Redirection:** The `sync` function directly uses the provided `url` parameter in a redirect operation without any checks or limitations. This allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when clicked, redirect users to fake login pages or other phishing websites, attempting to steal credentials or sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** Users could be redirected to websites hosting malware, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request to the `index.php` file using the `c=weixin&m=sync&url=` parameters.
- The attacker needs to supply an arbitrary URL as value of the `url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges are required. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
- The attacker needs to entice victims to click the malicious link.

**Technical Details:**

The blog post provides the following Proof of Concept (PoC):

```
http://finecms.com/index.php?c=weixin&m=sync&url=http://www.baidu.com
```

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can redirect a user to `http://www.baidu.com` by manipulating the `url` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post details multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS before v5.0.9, including SQL injections, reflected XSS, and remote code execution. However, only the URL redirection vulnerability is specifically linked to CVE-2017-11581.
