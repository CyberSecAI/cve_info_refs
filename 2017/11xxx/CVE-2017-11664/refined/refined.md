  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2017-11664": [
      {
        "Root cause": "The `_WM_SetupMidiEvent` function in `internal_midi.c:2122` allocates memory using `malloc` with `tmp_length + 1`, then copies `tmp_length` bytes from `event_data` using `memcpy`, without verifying if `tmp_length` is within the bounds of `event_data`.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Out-of-bounds read",
          "Incorrect memory handling",
		      "Use of unvalidated size"
        ],
        "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) due to invalid memory read.",
        "Attack vectors": "Crafted MIDI file",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted MIDI file to the vulnerable application."
