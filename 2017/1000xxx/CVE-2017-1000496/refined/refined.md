- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application processes XML files within a ZIP archive without disabling entity loading, making it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, specifically the "billion laughs" attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XXE vulnerability due to improper handling of XML entities during configuration import, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service (DoS) scenario is created by exhausting system resources when processing the malicious XML payload.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker uploads a ZIP archive containing malicious XML files that exploit the XXE vulnerability through a "billion laughs" attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to upload ZIP files containing XML files to the application.
