The content discusses two vulnerabilities in the Plug library for Elixir:

**1. Null Byte Injection in Plug.Static**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Plug.Static` module, used for serving static assets, is vulnerable to null byte injection due to how file paths are handled. Specifically, the content type is determined by file extension using `Mime.from_path` but the file system access will not be affected by the null byte.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability arises from the fact that the underlying file system operations are affected by null bytes while the application's logic is not, which can lead to discrepancies. The application logic relies on the file extension for content type detection, while the file system may interpret a file path with a null byte differently.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass file type restrictions. For example, if the application expects an image but the request contains a null byte after the expected file extension (e.g., "image.png%00.html"), the server could serve a file with a different content type.  This could allow an attacker to upload a file with a malicious extension but disguise it as a safe file type, or download a sensitive file by crafting a null byte injection attack.
*   **Attack Vector:** By inserting a null byte (`%00`) into the requested file path. For example `/assets/secret.db%00%favicon.ico`
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server, and know the directory structure for static files.

**2. Arbitrary Code Execution in Cookie Serialization**

*   **Root Cause:** The default serialization mechanism used by `Plug.Session` is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution under certain circumstances.
*   **Weakness:** The default serializer for Plug session cookies can be exploited to execute arbitrary code if an attacker can craft a malicious serialized payload. 
*   **Impact:** An attacker, if they obtain the application's secret key and signing/encryption salts, could craft a malicious session cookie. Although the cookie is signed and encrypted this can still be an issue if secrets are leaked.
*  **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker must obtain the secret key and signing/encryption salts, create a malicious cookie and send it to the application. 
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to obtain the secret key and salts used by the application, which are typically stored on the server.

The content also provides temporary fixes for both vulnerabilities and notes that the vulnerabilities were reported by the NCC Group.
The fix for the first issue was to add a check using the `Enum.any?` function in `safe_plug_static` to ensure that there are no null bytes present in the path and raise an error if found.
The fix for the second issue is to switch to a custom serializer that uses `erlang.term_to_binary` for encoding and `erlang.binary_to_term` for decoding and that will validate for certain types.
