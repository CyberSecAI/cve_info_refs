    "root_cause": "An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the remoting-based Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blocklist-based protection mechanism.",

      "Transferring a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the remoting-based Jenkins CLI",
      "Exploiting a bidirectional communication channel over HTTP"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a serialized payload with the command to execute. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending two HTTP requests; the first initiates a session for the bi-directional channel and is used for downloading data from the server and the second request sends the malicious serialized payload. No authentication is required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability resides in the remoting-based Jenkins CLI protocol. The vulnerable code handles a bi-directional communication channel (over HTTP) that accepts commands. The HTTP header “Session” is the identifier for the channel and the HTTP header “Side” specifies the “downloading/uploading” direction. The second request is the sending component of the bidirectional channel and the first requests is blocked until the second request is sent."
