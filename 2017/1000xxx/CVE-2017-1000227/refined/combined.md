## Advisory:

# Stored XSS in Salutation Responsive WordPress + BuddyPress Theme could allow logged-in users to do almost anything an admin can

## Vulnerability

Last revised: July 31, 2017

The theme contains JavaScript (`assets/js/onLoad.js`) which iterates through `.section-tabs a` and puts every `href` value it finds into `jQuery()`. `jQuery()` doesn’t just search for elements which match a selector (i.e. `jQuery('.section-tabs')`), it also creates elements (i.e. `jQuery('<div>')`).

```
$('.section-tabs').simpleSlideTop();

// ...

$.fn.simpleSlideTop = function(opts) {

    // ...

    contentID = $(this).attr('href');

    $(contentID).hide();
```

An attacker without the `unfiltered_html` capability would be able to inject arbitrary HTML as if they had the `unfiltered_html` capability. With the ability to inject arbitrary HTML, the attacker is able add JavaScript which causes a logged-in administrator user to do almost anything – including creating new user accounts, deleting posts, and more.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 4.9 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | Single |
| Confidentiality | Partial |
| Integrity | Partial |
| Availability | None |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

1. Click the activate button on the theme
2. Install and activate Revolution Slider plugin
3. Create a new user with role of Author (by default, Authors do not possess the `unfiltered_html` capability)
4. Log in as that user
5. Visit “Add New Post” screen
6. Switch the editor to “Text” mode
7. Enter the following: `<div class="section-tabs"><a href="&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;">a</a></div>`
8. Press “Publish”
9. Press “View post”
10. You will see an alertbox appear showing the value “1”

For comparison, if the same user account enters `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` or `<script>alert(1)</script>`, it will be blocked by WordPress.
