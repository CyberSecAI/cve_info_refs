The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000227.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Salutation Responsive WordPress + BuddyPress Theme contains JavaScript code (`assets/js/onLoad.js`) that iterates through elements with the class `.section-tabs a`. It extracts the `href` attribute value from each of these elements and passes it to the jQuery function `jQuery()`. Because the `jQuery()` function can not only search for elements based on a selector but also create new elements from HTML strings, this behavior can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML into the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The theme's JavaScript code does not properly sanitize or validate the `href` values before passing them to the `jQuery()` function, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript.
- The vulnerability circumvents WordPress's `unfiltered_html` capability check, effectively granting an attacker with limited privileges the ability to inject arbitrary HTML as if they possessed the `unfiltered_html` capability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
- The injected JavaScript can be executed in the context of a logged-in administrator's session, granting the attacker the ability to perform actions on behalf of the administrator, such as creating new user accounts, deleting posts, or taking complete control of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with limited user privileges (e.g., Author role) can inject malicious HTML through a post. The vulnerable code processes the post content and renders the injected HTML and JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A user account with the ability to create/edit posts (e.g., Author role)
- The attacker does not need the `unfiltered_html` capability to exploit this vulnerability
