      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability is a stack clash which occurs when the stack pointer moves into another memory region without triggering a page fault. This happens due to an insufficient stack guard page, which is intended to prevent such clashes by raising a page fault before the stack pointer can move out of the stack's designated memory region. A small guard page allows the stack pointer to 'jump' over it and enter an adjacent memory region.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient stack guard-page size.",
          "Implicit and fragile stack expansion mechanism relying on page-fault exceptions.",
		  "Lack of checks to prevent the stack-pointer from moving into another memory region without accessing the stack guard-page"
        ],
        "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to: Overwriting the stack with the other memory region, or overwriting the other memory region with stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is also used to bypass protections such as NX, ASLR and SSP.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Clashing the stack with other memory regions by allocating memory until the stack reaches another memory region, or another memory region reaches the stack.",
          "Jumping over the stack guard-page by moving the stack pointer from the stack into another memory region without accessing the guard page.",
          "Smashing the stack or another memory region by overwriting one with the other."
        ],
        "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the vulnerable system. Additionally, the attacker needs to be able to allocate sufficient stack and heap memory to cause the clash, and to control the memory regions to be smashed."

      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The libffi library was enforcing an executable stack on the i386 architecture. This allows code to be executed on the stack which is not ideal.",

          "Executable stack on i386 architecture."
        ],
        "impact": "This can be leveraged when exploiting other vulnerabilities, like the \"stack clash\" class of vulnerabilities.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "This weakness makes it easier to exploit stack clash vulnerabilities."
        ],
