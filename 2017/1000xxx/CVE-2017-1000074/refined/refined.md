The content provided describes a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `string_repeat()` function of the Gravity programming language, as identified in issue #131 on the project's GitHub repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `string_repeat()` function in `gravity_core.c` does not properly validate the input size of the string to be repeated, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. The `strcpy` and `strcat` functions used for string manipulation within this function are susceptible to this vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing bounds checks when copying strings.
- Integer overflow in the calculation of the repeated string size, which can lead to smaller buffer allocations that can then be overflowed.
- Use of `strcpy` and `strcat` without length checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The attacker can gain complete control of the program's memory by overflowing the integers involved in the `.repeat()` function and using the overflow to overwrite return addresses.
- The vulnerability results in crashes, as demonstrated by Valgrind, ASAN and GDB outputs.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a Gravity program with a string and a large repetition count passed to the `.repeat()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute or provide a malicious Gravity program to the vulnerable interpreter. The provided testcase illustrates this attack by creating a string and calling the `repeat()` method on it with a large input value.
