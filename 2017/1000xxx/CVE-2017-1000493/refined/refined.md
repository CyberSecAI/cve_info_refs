Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NoSQL injection in the Rocket.Chat API, specifically within the `query` and `fields` parameters used to retrieve user data. The API does not properly sanitize user input when constructing database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NoSQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into database queries, enabling attackers to manipulate the query structure.
- Lack of Input Validation: The API does not validate or sanitize the `query` and `fields` parameters, allowing malicious users to inject arbitrary NoSQL queries.
- Information Disclosure: Exploitation of the NoSQL injection leads to the disclosure of sensitive user data, including usernames, email addresses, login tokens, password hashes, and password reset tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive user data, including administrator credentials.
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers can use password hashes to attempt to crack passwords, or use password reset tokens to directly take over user accounts, including admin accounts. This provides full access to chat conversations and system configurations.
- **System Compromise:** Gaining admin access can lead to further compromise of the Rocket.Chat application and possibly the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious API Requests: The attacker crafts malicious API requests containing injected NoSQL queries in the `query` and `fields` parameters.
- Exploitation of `/api/v1/users.list` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Regular User Account:** A regular user account on the Rocket.Chat instance is required to make requests to the API.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Rocket.Chat instance.
- **Knowledge of the API**: Basic understanding of how to interact with the Rocket.Chat API and the structure of NoSQL queries.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Rocket.Chat versions 0.57.3, 0.58.3, and prior, as well as in the development branch at the time of reporting.
- The fix for this vulnerability was deployed on October 5, 2017, in [pull request #8408](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/8408).
- The blog post provides proof-of-concept attack steps for both extracting password hashes and performing account takeover via password reset.
