- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `import.php` script, specifically at line 200, where user-provided data during skin imports is unserialized without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the use of `unserialize()` on untrusted data. This allows for the potential execution of arbitrary PHP code if a malicious user crafts a specially crafted serialized object within the skin import file (XML).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting a malicious serialized object. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including but not limited to: data breaches, modification or deletion of data, denial of service, or complete system compromise. The provided error message "Object of class \_\_PHP\_Incomplete\_Class could not be converted to string" suggests that the unserialization is creating an incomplete object that cannot be processed correctly by the `clean_css` function.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the skin import function, where a user uploads a custom skin file (myskin.xml) containing a malicious serialized object within the XML structure.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to upload a skin via the skin import functionality.  It is not explicitly specified in the provided context the required user level to perform this operation, however, it's unlikely that such capability would be available to unauthenticated users.
