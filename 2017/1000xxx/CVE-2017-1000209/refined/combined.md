### @blunden **[blunden](/blunden)** commented [Apr 22, 2017](#issue-223598794)

Without this change, the WebSocket library will accept

a trusted certificate issued for domain A when connecting

to domain B. This could be exploited for Man-in-the-middle

attacks.

The underlying issue is that Java considers hostname

verification to be a part of HTTPS and as such, will

not perform it by default.

This change adds the default HostnameVerifier used

by Android, which in recent versions is derived from

OkHttp. Minor changes were made to make it build for

Java 1.6.

Tested with and without a proxy configured.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@TakahikoKawasaki](https://github.com/TakahikoKawasaki) A public test server that can be used to reliably reproduce this issue is available to you upon request.  **Status with this change:**   * **No proxy:** Working * **Standard HTTP proxy:** Working (verifies that hostname of the wss:// request matches certificate of the endpoint server) * **HTTPS proxy:** Untested (likely not working but I was unable to find a suitable proxy to test this with) |

| [@blunden](https://github.com/blunden) Released nv-websocket-client version 2.2. `WebSocket.connect()` method throws `HostnameUnverifiedException` (a subclass of `WebSocketException`) when the certificate of the peer does not match the expected hostname. Thank you for your contribution. |

| [@TakahikoKawasaki](https://github.com/TakahikoKawasaki) Thanks for merging it.  You will likely need to add hostname verification of the proxy's certificate if it's an HTTPS proxy. Like I said above, I don't have any of those to test with so currently it won't verify the hostname of the proxy, which it really should. It would probably be a simple fix but the ProxyHandshaker or Address would have to be able to return whether the user specified an http or https proxy address. You could then just add an if-statement based on that and a similar hostname verification of mAddress.getHostname() (which I think will be the proxy hostname) inside it. It did not do it myself because I couldn't test it and didn't want to risk breaking it. |
