- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jenkins remote API at `/computer/(agent-name)/api` was disclosing information about tasks (typically builds) currently running on that agent, including tasks that the user did not have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient access control checks in the remote API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions could view information about builds running on an agent, even if they do not have the necessary Job/Read permissions to access those builds. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the build process.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted request to the `/computer/(agent-name)/api` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions. They do not need any specific Job/Read permissions.
