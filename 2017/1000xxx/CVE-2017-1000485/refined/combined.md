## Description

[![@l2dy](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14329097?u=33d0fb7c4ff9c80edb8606a21e3e6c8fe3b83734&v=4&size=48)](/l2dy)[l2dy](https://github.com/l2dy)opened [on Nov 29, 2017](https://github.com/nylas-mail-lives/nylas-mail/issues/181#issue-277632327)

On macOS, by default the `$HOME/.nylas-mail` directory has 755 permission, so other users can use `sqlite3 ~victim/.nylas-mail/shared.sqlite` and `select * from accounts;` to retrieve my credentials.

A CVE was assigned for [a similar vulnerability](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/commit/07106897a606ab290f5cf2fbaf52bbfa448a9d6b) in Telegram Desktop, should I request a CVE for this issue?
