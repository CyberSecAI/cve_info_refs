- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Script Security Plugin did not properly restrict access to certain Groovy language features within its sandbox environment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin failed to apply sandbox restrictions to type coercion, method references, positional constructor arguments lists and super constructor calls. This allowed for arbitrary method and constructor invocations, effectively bypassing sandbox protections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could bypass the sandbox restrictions, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins environment, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the use of these Groovy features in sandboxed scripts, such as Jenkins pipelines.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have the ability to run sandboxed Groovy scripts (such as having the ability to define or modify a pipeline), and know how to use the identified vulnerable language features.
