- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The filebrowser Pieform element performs file upload processing and returns a result message within the `pieform->get_value()` stage, bypassing the form validation stage where the session key (`sesskey`) is normally checked.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Due to the lack of session key validation during file uploads, an attacker can craft a malicious form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, can upload files to Mahara without the user's knowledge or consent.
    - Insecure File Upload: The vulnerability allows arbitrary file uploads, including potentially malicious files.
    - Bypassed Security Check: The intended `sesskey` check, designed to protect against CSRF, is bypassed during the file upload process using the filebrowser Pieform element.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary File Upload: Attackers can upload files of their choosing, which can include malicious scripts or other harmful content.
    - Unauthorized Access: Files can be uploaded to various areas, including group files, individual files, institution files, and site files (including public areas accessible by logged-out users).
    - Potential for further attacks: Uploaded malicious files may allow attackers to further compromise the system or its users.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - CSRF: The attacker creates a malicious HTML form that mimics the Mahara file upload process. This form is hosted on a site controlled by the attacker.
    - Social Engineering: The attacker tricks a logged-in Mahara user into visiting the malicious page with the crafted form, leading to an unintentional file upload when the user unknowingly submits the form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to host a malicious website or control content on a website visited by the targeted Mahara user.
    - The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML forms and HTTP requests to construct the malicious form.
    - The attacker does not need to have any Mahara account or prior access to the platform.
    - The attacker must target a logged-in Mahara user who would unintentionally submit the attacker's form.
