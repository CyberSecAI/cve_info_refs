Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000027:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the 'back' parameter in the user login function of Koozali SME Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open URL Redirect: The server does not validate the URL provided in the 'back' parameter, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary redirect URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account Hijacking: If a user successfully logs in after clicking the malicious link, the server redirects them to the attacker-controlled URL. Critically, the server appends the user's session cookie/authentication token as a parameter to the redirect URL, which can then be captured by the attacker. The attacker can then use the stolen cookie to gain access to the user's SME Server account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious link to the SME Server login page. The link includes the 'back' parameter with a URL controlled by the attacker.
- The attacker then convinces a user to click on this malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL for the SME Server login page and host a webserver to receive the redirected requests.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click the malicious link. No prior authentication is needed.
