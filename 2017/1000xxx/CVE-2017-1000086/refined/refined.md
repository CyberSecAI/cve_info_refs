The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000086.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Periodic Backup Plugin did not perform any permission checks on its API endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission checks allowed any user with Overall/Read access to change its settings, trigger backups, restore backups, and delete all previous backups via log rotation.
- The plugin was not requiring POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could:
- Change backup settings.
- Trigger backups.
- Restore backups.
- Delete all previous backups via log rotation.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A user with Overall/Read access could directly access the plugin's API endpoints.
- A remote attacker could exploit the lack of CSRF protection via a crafted request from a different origin to trigger the malicious actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- For the CSRF attack vector the attacker needs to entice a user with Overall/Read permissions to trigger the malicious actions.
