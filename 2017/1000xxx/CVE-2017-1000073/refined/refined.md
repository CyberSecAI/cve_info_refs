The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1000073.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap overflow or corruption vulnerability in the `gravity` programming language. The issue seems to stem from incorrect memory management during the `realloc` function, likely due to an invalid size being passed to it, leading to heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow/corruption: The vulnerability involves overwriting heap metadata or adjacent heap blocks.
- Invalid `realloc` size: The crash log indicates that `realloc` is called with an invalid size, which suggests a flaw in how memory is managed during runtime.
- Invalid memory writes and reads: The Valgrind output shows invalid memory writes and reads in `gravity_vm_exec` function, indicating a buffer overflow. The code is writing past the allocated memory which results in memory corruption and subsequent issues such as invalid reads

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The immediate impact is a program crash due to heap corruption, indicated by the "Aborted (core dumped)" message.
- Arbitrary code execution (potential): Although not explicitly stated, heap overflows can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully control the overwritten data.
- Denial of Service: By causing the program to crash, attackers can cause a denial of service.
- Information disclosure: Memory corruption issues can potentially be exploited to leak sensitive information in memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Input to the program: The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input file, as shown in the Valgrind command line. This suggests that the input data is causing an incorrect size calculation that results in the heap overflow.
- File parsing/processing: Specifically, the issue seems to be triggered during a `gravity_vm_exec` routine, indicating a parsing/processing flaw of input data within the `gravity` virtual machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input to the program: An attacker needs to be able to supply a specifically crafted input file to trigger the vulnerability.
- Understanding of input processing: Some level of understanding of the input format for `gravity` would be needed to craft the input file to exploit the overflow.

**Additional details:**
The issue was discovered and reported by `blindfuzzy`.
The provided information includes:
- Crash log with backtrace.
- Valgrind output showing invalid memory writes and reads, and a heap metadata corruption.
- The issue was found while fuzzing the application using a malformed input file
