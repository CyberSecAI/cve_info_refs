Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-1000457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within the help dialog of mojoPortal. Specifically, the `helpText` variable, which appears to contain HTML, was being directly rendered without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. By injecting malicious HTML into the `helpText` variable, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts, which can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information such as user credentials.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    - **Website Defacement:** Altering the content of the affected web page.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content to steal user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `helpText` variable in the `Help.aspx.cs` file. An attacker could inject malicious HTML into a field that populates this variable, then view the help dialog, causing the malicious script to execute in the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to influence the content of the `helpText` variable. This could potentially involve modifying a help text file, database record, or injecting data via a form field that ends up in the help system.

**Technical Details:**
The fix applied in the commit addresses the vulnerability by modifying the following line:
```csharp
litHelp.Text = helpText;
```
to:
```csharp
litHelp.Text = HttpUtility.HtmlDecode(SecurityHelper.RemoveMarkup(helpText));
```
This change first uses `SecurityHelper.RemoveMarkup` to remove potentially dangerous HTML tags, then `HttpUtility.HtmlDecode` to decode any HTML entities within the string, which would prevent double encoding.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "Fix possible XSS bug in help dialog" explicitly identifies the type of vulnerability.
- The code diff shows that the fix is applied in the `Web/Help.aspx.cs` file.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jarrod Farncomb of TSS.
