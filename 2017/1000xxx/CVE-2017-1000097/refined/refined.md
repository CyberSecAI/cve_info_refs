Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `crypto/x509` package in Go not properly honoring user-defined trust settings for root certificates on macOS (Darwin). Specifically, if a user had marked a root certificate as untrusted in their Keychain, Go programs would still incorrectly trust and use it to verify connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Failure to respect user's explicit certificate trust settings.
- Improper handling of certificate verification process on macOS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor could potentially exploit this flaw by presenting a certificate chain that includes a root certificate which the user has explicitly distrusted in their keychain. Go applications would erroneously trust this chain leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
- This could allow an attacker to intercept and modify encrypted network traffic, perform phishing attacks, and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network connections that require TLS/SSL certificate verification.
- An attacker could present a forged certificate chain during a connection attempt that includes a root certificate that a user has distrusted.
- This could occur during normal internet browsing or while using applications that rely on Go's crypto/x509 package for secure communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate network traffic between the vulnerable Go application and the server it's trying to communicate with.
- The attacker would need to have control over the certificate chain being presented to the Go application during the TLS handshake process, specifically to include a root certificate distrusted by the user.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the macOS operating system due to the way it handles certificate trust settings.
- The issue was identified and reported by Xy Ziemba, according to the report.
- The issue was marked as `Security` and assigned a milestone of `Go1.7.4`.
