## Description

[![@quentinmit](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115761?v=4&size=48)](/quentinmit)[quentinmit](https://github.com/quentinmit)opened [on Dec 1, 2016](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18141#issue-192897796)

On Darwin, user's trust preferences for root certificates were not honored. If the user had a root certificate loaded in their Keychain that was explicitly not trusted, a Go program would still verify a connection using that root certificate.

Thanks to Xy Ziemba for identifying and reporting this issue.
