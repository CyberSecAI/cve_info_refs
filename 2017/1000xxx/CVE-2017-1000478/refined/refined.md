- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when saving experiment information, allowing the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript. Specifically, the TinyMCE editor is bypassed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Input sanitization is not sufficient.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the application. An attacker can execute malicious scripts on the browser of other users who view the compromised experiment.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with the ability to edit an experiment can inject malicious code by intercepting the save request and modifying the 'infos' section to include malicious HTML tags.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to edit an experiment within the application. Additionally, a web interception proxy like Burp Suite is needed to modify the request.
