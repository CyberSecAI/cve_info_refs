- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mahara application did not require a password confirmation when a user changed their username. This was also an issue for changing the primary email address and deleting the account, but those are handled differently as described below.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper authentication/authorization checks when changing a user's username.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to a logged-in user's session could change the username of the victim, potentially causing confusion or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to have access to a logged-in user's session, whether by being physically present at the computer, or by somehow gaining access to the session via malware, etc.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access an active Mahara user session.

The provided content also mentions the following mitigations/additional information:
    - The issue of changing the primary email has been mitigated by sending a 'heads up' message to the existing email addresses when a new one is added.
    - The issue of deleting an account has been mitigated by the option to set a site setting that requires admin approval before an account deletion is finalized.
    - The fix for changing the username requires the user to enter their password before the username can be changed.
    - The fix for the vulnerability was released in versions 18.04.0 and 18.10.0
    - The fix was made only for auth methods that allow username changes.
