Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `config` and `migrate` parameters in AWStats, which allows for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path traversal: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `config` and `migrate` parameters, allowing attackers to manipulate file paths.
- Arbitrary code execution: By exploiting the path traversal, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by providing malicious input, potentially gaining full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET/POST request: By crafting malicious URLs with the `config` or `migrate` parameters.
- Command-line arguments: By providing malicious input via command-line parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker. The attacker does not need to be logged in.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `awstats.pl` file. Specifically:

- The `config` parameter is used to specify the configuration file to load.
- The `migrate` parameter is used for data migration.

In both cases, the application uses a sanitization function, `Sanitize()`, which was not initially sufficient.

The fixes involve:

-   Sanitizing the `LoadPlugin` parameter to prevent arbitrary code execution through `eval()`.
-   Preventing directory traversal using `s/\.\.//g` to remove `../` sequences from the `SiteConfig` variable derived from the `config` and `migrate` parameters.
-   Additional sanitization for `migrate` parameter was added to remove `.` at the beginning of string: `$SiteConfig =~ s/^\.//;`

The vulnerable code snippets are like:
```perl
if ( $QueryString =~ /config=([^&]+)/i ) {
  $SiteConfig = &Sanitize("$1");
}
```
```perl
if ( $QueryString =~ /(^|-|&|&amp;)migrate=([^&]+)/i ) {
  $MigrateStats = &Sanitize("$2");
  $MigrateStats =~ /^(.\*)$PROG(\d{0,2})(\d\d)(\d\d\d\d)(.\*)\.txt$/;
  $SiteConfig = $5 ? $5 : 'xxx';
}
```

The fix included additional sanitization and validation:
```perl
if ( $QueryString =~ /config=([^&]+)/i ) {
  $SiteConfig = &Sanitize("$1");
  $SiteConfig =~ s/\.\.//g; # Avoid directory transversal
}
```
```perl
if ( $QueryString =~ /(^|-|&|&amp;)migrate=([^&]+)/i ) {
 $MigrateStats = &Sanitize("$2");
 $MigrateStats =~ /^(.\*)$PROG(\d{0,2})(\d\d)(\d\d\d\d)(.\*)\.txt$/;
 $SiteConfig = $5 ? $5 : 'xxx';
 $SiteConfig = &Sanitize($5 ? $5 : 'xxx');
 $SiteConfig =~ s/^\.//; # SiteConfig is used to find config file
}
```
