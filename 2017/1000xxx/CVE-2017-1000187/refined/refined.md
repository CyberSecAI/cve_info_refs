The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000187.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an invalid address access (segmentation fault) within the `pdf2swf` tool, specifically when processing a crafted PDF file with specific TrueType fonts. The crash occurs during the `FoFiTrueType__writeTTF` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Invalid memory access leading to a segmentation fault. This indicates a potential use-after-free, out-of-bounds access, or dereference of a null pointer.
- Vulnerability lies within the TrueType font processing logic of `pdf2swf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The immediate impact is a crash of the `pdf2swf` tool. An attacker can potentially cause a denial of service by providing specially crafted PDF files to be processed by the tool.
- Potential for other vulnerabilities: The memory corruption may potentially lead to other vulnerabilities like arbitrary code execution, but this is not described here.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specifically crafted PDF file.
- The user needs to use `pdf2swf` to convert the crafted pdf file using the command-line options specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the vulnerable `pdf2swf` tool.
- The attacker has to be able to execute the `pdf2swf` command with crafted pdf file as input.
