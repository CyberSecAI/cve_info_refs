Replace marshalling with pluggable serializers

[Browse files](/redis-store/redis-store/tree/e0c1398d54a9661c8c70267c3a925ba6b192142e)

```
This is in response to a vulnerability warning we received on Friday,
August 11th, 2017. While most users will not be affected by this
change, we recommend that developers of new applications use a different
serializer other than `Marshal`. This, along with the removal of the
`:marshalling` option, will enforce "sane defaults" in terms of securely
serializing/de-serializing data.

- Add `:serializer` option and deprecate `:marshalling`. Although you
  will still be able to enable/disable serialization with Marshal using
  `:marshalling` in the 1.x series, this will be removed by 2.0.

- Rename `Redis::Store::Marshalling` to `Redis::Store::Serialization` to
  reflect its new purpose.

Fixes [#289](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/issues/289)
