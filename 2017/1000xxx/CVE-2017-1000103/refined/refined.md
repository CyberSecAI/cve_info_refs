- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Details" view of the DRY Plugin did not sanitize HTML in messages, allowing for a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Persistent XSS. The plugin displayed issue descriptions verbatim without sanitizing or escaping them.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious users could inject arbitrary HTML into the "Details" view, potentially leading to arbitrary script execution within the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to account compromise or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user can insert arbitrary HTML by influencing the input to the plugin (e.g., console output).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the DRY plugin.
