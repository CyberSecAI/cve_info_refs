Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-1000363:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `lp_setup()` function within the Linux kernel's lp (line printer) driver. Specifically, when processing the "lp=none" kernel command-line argument, the code increments the `parport_ptr` without verifying if it remains within the bounds of the `parport_nr` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write to the `parport_nr` array. When the number of `lp=none` arguments exceeds `LP_NO`, the `parport_ptr` variable will increment past the allocated size, leading to memory corruption when writing to `parport_nr[parport_ptr++]`.
- **Integer overflow:** Though not the primary vulnerability, the lack of a bounds check facilitates the integer overflow of `parport_ptr`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The out-of-bounds write can lead to memory corruption. With sufficient control over the written data and target address, an attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** Memory corruption can also cause the kernel to crash leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Kernel command-line argument:** The primary attack vector is by manipulating the kernel command-line arguments, specifically by including many instances of `lp=none`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Kernel command-line write access:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the kernel command-line parameters. This can be achieved through a bootloader vulnerability, physical access to the device, or other means.
- **Local access:** The vulnerability is local, thus the attacker requires access to the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Linux kernel.
- The patch adds a bounds check to ensure that `parport_ptr` is within the valid range of `LP_NO` before writing to the `parport_nr` array.
- The vulnerability was reported by Roee Hay from Aleph Research.
