Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-1000025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the password manager's flawed logic in associating saved passwords with websites. Specifically, the password manager was using the host (domain) of the website as the identifier for stored credentials instead of the security origin (protocol + host + port). This allowed HTTP websites to access passwords that were saved for the corresponding HTTPS version of the same site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Password Storage Association:**  The password manager was incorrectly using only the hostname, not the full security origin (protocol, host, and port) to associate saved passwords.
*   **Lack of HSTS Support:** Epiphany did not support HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which could have prevented users from being redirected to attacker-controlled pages.
*   **Automatic Password Autofill:** The password manager automatically filled in passwords, without user interaction, which could be triggered by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Theft:** A remote network attacker could extract multiple passwords from the user's password manager without any user interaction.
*   **Enumeration of Passwords:**  An attacker could enumerate passwords for an arbitrary set of websites by using simple redirections from HTTP to a controlled site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**  An attacker intercepts the connection between the user and the intended website and redirects the user to an HTTP version of the site.
*   **JavaScript Injection:** The attacker uses JavaScript on the HTTP site to trigger the password autofill function of the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the intended website.
*   **Control of a Malicious HTTP Site:** The attacker needs to control a website on the HTTP version of a website to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Additional Details from the Bug Report:**

*   The bug report mentions that the issue was fixed by:
    *   Storing passwords based on the security origin, not just the host.
    *   Adding a migrator to migrate insecure passwords (passwords saved for HTTP sites).
    *   Properly normalizing URIs when accessing the secret service.
*  The fix requires users to re-enter their passwords for HTTP sites and only allows saved passwords to be available to https:// origins.
*   The bug report also mentions the lack of HSTS support in Epiphany, which further exacerbated the issue.

In summary, the vulnerability stemmed from a failure to properly isolate passwords based on the full security origin, which allowed a MITM attacker to gain access to a user's stored passwords, especially if the user had previously saved passwords on the HTTPS version of a website. The fix involved using the full security origin, adding migration support, and warning users about saving passwords on insecure pages.
