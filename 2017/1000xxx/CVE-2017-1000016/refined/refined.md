**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of input related to cookie attributes. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate data when setting cookie attributes, which allows for injection of malicious content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary values into the user's browser cookies.
- The injected cookie values could be used to potentially perform actions as the user, gain access to user's session or other forms of attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the cookie attributes. This likely involves crafting specific HTTP requests or manipulating URL parameters that are then used to set cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to manipulate requests and responses that interact with the application setting cookies.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is considered non-critical, but it is still a security concern that should be addressed.
- The vulnerability is mitigated when the server is properly configured to set `PHP_SELF`, indicating the attack is dependent on server configuration.
- The specific versions affected are all phpMyAdmin 4.6.x versions prior to 4.6.6.
- The fix involves upgrading to phpMyAdmin 4.6.6 or newer or applying the provided patch.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-661 (Incorrect Functionality).
