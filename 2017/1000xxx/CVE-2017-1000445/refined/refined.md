Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-1000445:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference exists in the `MagickCore` component of ImageMagick. Specifically, the `AcquireRandomInfoThreadSet` function may return `NULL` when memory allocation fails. This NULL value is then dereferenced, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to dereference a pointer (`random_info`) without ensuring it is not NULL after the call to `AcquireRandomInfoThreadSet`, a function that can fail and return NULL.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The code does not check the return value of `AcquireRandomInfoThreadSet` before dereferencing it. This lack of error checking allows the NULL pointer dereference to occur.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The null pointer dereference leads to a crash, causing the program to terminate and denying service to users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can craft a malformed image file that triggers the memory allocation failure in `AcquireRandomInfoThreadSet`.
- **Image Processing:** When ImageMagick processes this crafted image, it will lead to the null pointer dereference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide an image to ImageMagick for processing.
- No special privileges are required, an attacker with local or remote access to a system using ImageMagick to process user-provided images could potentially trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `SketchImage` function in `MagickCore/fx.c`, as well as similar code in `MagickCore/effect.c`, `MagickCore/threshold.c` and `MagickCore/statistic.c`.
- Patches for this vulnerability involve adding checks for a NULL return value from `AcquireRandomInfoThreadSet` and handling the error appropriately, preventing the crash.
- The issue is identified as affecting multiple versions of ImageMagick including those used in Ubuntu and Debian.
