The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000089.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Pipeline: Build Step Plugin did not check the build authentication it was running as.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Missing permission check on build authentication. The plugin allows triggering any other project in Jenkins without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could trigger arbitrary builds within Jenkins, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources, execution of malicious code, or denial of service, depending on the configuration of the triggered builds.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering a build that uses the Pipeline: Build Step plugin to execute a downstream build.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger a build using the vulnerable plugin. It is mentioned that builds by default run as SYSTEM and are unconstrained unless plugins implement specific additional permission checks.
