{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `Curl_smtp_escape_eob()` function of curl when uploading data over SMTP with a reduced read buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing a crash or corrupting memory.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network (SMTP)",
        "Specifically crafted data"
        ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to manipulate data sent to a vulnerable SMTP server"
    ],
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability occurs because the buffer size for `Curl_smtp_escape_eob` is incorrectly calculated, leading to a heap buffer overflow. This is triggered when uploading data over SMTP and using a reduced read buffer. Some RHEL versions are not affected as they do not use the buffer size value to allocate a scratch buffer in `Curl_smtp_escape_eob`."
