The provided content includes information about CVE-2017-1000114:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Datadog Plugin stored an API key in plain text as part of the configuration form. While the API key was stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text during configuration form view.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Plain text transmission of sensitive data (API Key).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exposure of the Datadog API key, which could lead to unauthorized access and control of the Datadog service associated with the key. This could happen through browser extensions, XSS vulnerabilities, or similar attack vectors.

**Attack vectors:**
Network interception when loading the Jenkins configuration form, malicious browser extensions, or exploitation of other vulnerabilities such as XSS could be used to expose the plain text API key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to view the Jenkins global configuration form. This might require access to the Jenkins instance with the ability to view the configuration. The attacker would not need to be authenticated to see the API key being sent if they can intercept the transmission.

**Additional details:**
The Datadog Plugin now encrypts the API key before transmitting it to administrators viewing the global configuration form, resolving the vulnerability.
