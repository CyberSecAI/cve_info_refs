The content discusses two vulnerabilities in the Plug library for Elixir: a null byte injection vulnerability in `Plug.Static` and an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in cookie serialization.

**Null Byte Injection in `Plug.Static`**

*   **Root cause:** The `Plug.Static` module is vulnerable to null byte injection due to how the path is handled. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the Erlang runtime's file system interaction does not properly handle null bytes in file paths. When a null byte is encountered within the requested path, the file system API will treat the path as terminated, effectively ignoring the characters after the null byte.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Null byte injection allows bypassing file type restrictions, leading to serving files with incorrect content types. This can be exploited to serve malicious files with an unexpected MIME type, potentially leading to client-side vulnerabilities.
    *   Although the content suggests that access control bypass is unlikely in most cases due to prefix based authentication, it is highlighted that this could be an issue in more granular access control scenarios.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Serving of files with incorrect content type which may lead to client-side exploits.
    *   Potential access control bypass, depending on how access control is implemented.
*  **Attack vectors:** By injecting a null byte (`%00`) into a requested path for a static asset, an attacker can manipulate the content type of the response. Example:  `images/phoenix.png%00.html`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Arbitrary Code Execution in Cookie Serialization**

*   **Root cause:** The default serialization used by `Plug.Session` could lead to code execution if an attacker could modify the serialized data in the session cookie with arbitrary code and the application deserializes this in an unsafe way.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Unsafe deserialization of session cookies due to the use of `:erlang.binary_to_term` without proper validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the server if the attacker has access to secret key and the application attempts to deserialize a crafted cookie
*   **Attack vectors:**  An attacker could craft a malicious payload, serialize it, and inject it into a session cookie.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the application's secret key and signing/encryption salts to forge a valid session cookie.

The provided fixes include upgrading Plug or applying temporary code patches to sanitize input paths and use a safer serializer.
