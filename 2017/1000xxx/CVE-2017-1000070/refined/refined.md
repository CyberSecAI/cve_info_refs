The provided content contains a detailed analysis of security considerations for OAuth 2.0, including a threat model and countermeasures. It also contains a GitHub pull request that addresses an open redirect vulnerability in oauth2_proxy. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Content 1: GitHub Pull Request #359**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `oauth2_proxy` application was vulnerable to an open redirect. The vulnerability was caused by insufficient validation of the "rd" query parameter, which specified the redirect URL. Specifically, a crafted "rd" parameter in the form `//domain.com/` could bypass the redirect check, leading to redirection to an arbitrary domain.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could redirect users to a malicious site after they log in via oauth2_proxy, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the "rd" parameter in the authorization URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a specific `rd` parameter, and then trick the user into clicking on that link or using it as a redirect URL.

**Content 2: RFC 6819 - OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations**

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of potential threats to OAuth 2.0 and suggests security considerations for mitigating them. It doesn't describe a specific vulnerability but is highly relevant since it provides background on the vulnerabilities and how they may be mitigated. Here's a summary of its key aspects:

*   **General Security Features:** The document details several security features built into OAuth 2.0, such as access tokens, refresh tokens, authorization codes, redirect URIs, and the "state" parameter. These are intended to mitigate various attacks.
*   **Threat Model Breakdown:**
    *   **Clients:** Threats such as obtaining client secrets, refresh tokens, and access tokens are discussed. The document also covers end-user credential phishing through compromised browsers and open redirectors on clients.
    *   **Authorization Endpoint:** Threats include password phishing by a counterfeit authorization server, unintentional granting of excessive access scopes, malicious clients obtaining existing authorizations by fraud, and open redirectors.
    *   **Token Endpoint:** This covers eavesdropping on access tokens, obtaining tokens from the authorization server database, disclosure of client credentials during transmission, obtaining client secrets from the database, and guessing client secrets.
    *   **Obtaining Authorization:** This section details threats related to authorization codes, including eavesdropping, database leakage, online guessing, malicious clients obtaining authorization, code phishing, user session impersonation, code leakage through counterfeit clients, CSRF attacks, clickjacking attacks, resource owner impersonation, denial-of-service attacks, and code substitution. It also covers similar threats for the implicit grant type and resource owner password credentials.
    *   **Refreshing an Access Token:** Covers eavesdropping and database leakage of refresh tokens and online guessing.
    *   **Accessing Protected Resources:** Covers eavesdropping on access tokens, replay of authorized requests, guessing access tokens, access token phishing by a counterfeit resource server, abuse of tokens by legitimate entities, and leakage of confidential data in HTTP proxies.

*   **Security Considerations:** The document provides detailed recommendations for mitigating identified threats, including ensuring request confidentiality, utilizing server authentication, informing the resource owner, enforcing secure credential storage, limiting token scope and lifetime, and more. It also addresses specific recommendations for the authorization server, client applications, and resource servers.

In conclusion, the GitHub pull request describes a specific open redirect vulnerability in `oauth2_proxy` and how it was fixed, while RFC 6819 provides a general background and a thorough guide on OAuth 2.0 security vulnerabilities and how they should be mitigated. The GitHub content directly relates to the vulnerability type (open redirect) discussed in the RFC.
