- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Constructors, instance variable initializers, and instance initializers in Pipeline scripts were not subject to sandbox protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incomplete sandbox protection, allowing execution of arbitrary code within Pipeline scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins server.
- **Attack vectors**: By configuring pipelines in Jenkins or by committing malicious code to a repository containing Jenkinsfiles.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Regular Jenkins users with the permission to configure pipelines or trusted committers to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles.
