Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-1000018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A specially crafted table name can trigger a Denial of Service (DOS) condition in the replication status functionality of phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling of table names in the replication status feature, leading to a DOS.
- CWE-661: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges, though the description indicates that this vulnerability is related to DOS, not privilege escalation or access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is a denial of service. Exploiting this vulnerability can make the phpMyAdmin application unavailable by crashing the replication status process, preventing users from accessing the database management tool or its related features.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the use of a specially crafted table name. This indicates that an attacker would need the ability to create or manipulate table names within the MySQL database that phpMyAdmin is managing to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have some level of access to the MySQL database to create or rename tables, and also potentially access phpMyAdmin and trigger the vulnerable replication status functionality. It is not explicit, but it can be inferred that they could trigger the vulnerable functionality by simply navigating to the replication status page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered non-critical.
- The issue affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.x (prior to 4.6.6), 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.15.10), and 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.19).
- Patches for the vulnerability were released.
