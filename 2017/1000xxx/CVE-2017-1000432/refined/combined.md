 edited November 2014   in [Releases](https://open.vanillaforums.com/categories/blog)

Vanilla 2.1.5 is now available. It is a security & bug fix release for the 2.1 branch.

This is an urgent upgrade for all forums.

**[DOWNLOAD HERE](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core-2.1.5 "DOWNLOAD HERE")**

25 files changed in this version. [GitHub code diff](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/compare/df1476510310939965feb1f4fb713eef5e372e99...ef8bb59a0a8f180f94e083e63eb8590284fcda48 "GitHub code diff")

Summary:

* **Security**: An Insecure Direct Object Reference was fixed that allowed unauthorized comment editing.
* **Security**: Potential CSRF vectors were closed, including one that could allow account hijacking.
* Fixes issue where enabling cleditor would permanently allow `style` parameter in comments.
* Fixes issue notifying users of new comments in certain cases where they did not have permission to then view them.
* Fixes OpenID bug effecting Google Sign In.
* Multiple community-contributed bug fixes.

Thanks to **Anand Meyyappan** (thru a sponsorship by Private Internet Access) for discovering the CSRF issues and to **Marcos Toledo** for responsibly disclosing them. And thanks to **Brandon Perry** at ZeniMax Online Studios for disclosing the Insecure Direct Object Reference.

Hat tips to [@hgtonight](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/hgtonight), [@R\_J](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/R_J), agauniyal, and [@Shadowdare](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Shadowdare) for contributing code to 2.1.5, and to [@Bleistivt](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Bleistivt) & [@hgtonight](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/hgtonight) for some quick testing when the release was fast-tracked yesterday when the IDOR was discovered.

---

If you are still on the 2.0 series, please [upgrade immediately to 2.0.18.14](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core-2.0.18.14 "upgrade immediately to 2.0.18.14") which closes the above noted security issues plus the DeliveryType issue noted in the 2.0.3 release. Reminder: We will end support of 2.0.\* at the end of the year.

  This release was fast-forwarded from 2.1.4 to 2.1.5 to fix a simple merge flaw in the settings controller.

  The upgrade instructions are in the README file.

  We do not recommend directly modifying core files.

  [@gohunter](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/gohunter) The `master` branch on GitHub is very different and not yet tested for distribution. Use at your own risk. You can clone the `2.1` branch safely.

  if you don't know how to clone the 2.1 branch via github. just get the zip. both using zip or cloning proper branch work. just installing zip is easy, unless you have a reason to use github and plan to send in commits to vanilla. Whatever is easiest and does the job. just don't use the wrong branch.

### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### [Snake Challenge: Hack The Box](https://anandtechzone.blogspot.com/2019/03/snake-challenge-hack-box.html)

**Snake Challenge: Hack The Box**

Download the challenge file and unzip the challenge file.We will be obtaining an

python file "snake.py".

Since this is a py file we will first run the snake.py using python.

Command: python snake.py

when we run this command we will be assigned a number and get prompted for a username.

Assuming the username as snake will prompt us 'wrong username try harder'

Let us try to find the username by analysing the source code snake.py

*<LOC 41,42>*

*user\_input = raw\_input('Enter your username\n')
if user\_input == slither:*

where slither is a variable which made by concatenating aa,db,nn,ef,rr,gh,lr,ty

*slither = aa + db + nn + ef + rr + gh + lr + ty*

Each variable is hexadecimal value(Since it starts with 0x)

*aa='\x61'
db='\x6e'
nn='\x61'
ef='\x63'* and so on.

converting this hex to ascii. you will be get able to get the username as

'anaconda'

again run the snake.py program.Command: python snake.py

now when your prompted for username enter the username that you have found

"anaconda"

This time you will be prompted for a password.Go Back to snake.py and analyze the script.

Notice carefully two variables lock and lock\_pick

lock\_pick = random.randint(0, 0x3e8)

where 0x3e8 is 1000 in decimal

For every random value from 0 to 1000

Ex: if the random value is 200

then following execution takes place

*lock = lock\_pick \* 2 //200 \*2
lock = lock + 10 //400+10
lock = lock / 2 //410/2
lock = lock - lock\_pick//205-200*

Now the lock value is 5 ,for every random value the lock will be 5

Replacing that lock value with 5 and re-run following loops:

*chars=[]
chains = [0x74, 0x68, 0x69, 0x73, 0x20, 0x69, 0x73, 0x20, 0x61, 0x20, 0x74, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x6c, 0x6c]
keys = [0x70, 0x61, 0x73, 0x73, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x64, 0x21, 0x21]
for key in keys:
    keys\_encrypt = 5 ^ key
    chars.append(keys\_encrypt)
for chain in chains:
    chains\_encrypt = chain + 0xA
    chars.append(chains\_encrypt)*

Print the char array by

*for char in chars:
    print char*

We will get the password, but ensure that only the first ten characters will be considered as the flag.

**{anaconda:..........}**

 Hello, This is Anand here. Welcome to this blog Post to get
an idea about OSCP Preparation and review.

**Pre-Requisites**

* -Eager to keep learning new things in Offensive security
* -Lots of Patience and Interest

I mentioned the above 2 because rest can be acquired if the
above two are there always.
Rest Technical skills are good to have: -

* -understanding different Protocols especially HTTP, SMB
* -Basic Linux and Windows commands and OS
* -Basics of Programming Languages, scripting languages

Depending on your learning capability and knowledge already
you have, it may take more time or less time to complete this course and
certification.
Once You enroll for OSCP, be clear to spend few hours daily
and more than 10-12 hours in a weekends. So plan accordingly and if you have a
full time Job try to utilize the weekends.
If you are entirely new to the Course you can take 3 months
for it, or less than that if you have already did Network and Web Application
Pen-testing.

Now that you have enrolled for OSCP Certification. The
Learning Journey Begins
An Email containing link to VM and notes will be provided on
the day you choose. Please note that you can’t start this course immediately if
you wish to or you need to book in a month advance.
After downloading the video and pdf guide, start to read the
topics daily. This may take at-least 15 days to finish if you ready and
practice daily few hours.

Now that you have learnt all the materials, techniques,
basic usage of tools for hacking into machines.
You can dive into the Labs. The mistake I did was to start
hacking lab machines without knowing where is head or tail. Wasted few days
there, As I didn’t know which machines are hard or easy.
So to begin the labs after going through the course
materials I decided to try metasploit on many machines to gain some confidence.
This method worked for me. Starting from IPs in particular order I tried to get
whichever was easy ones and noted down the steps for each machines for later
reference.
After a week I was able to get 5-6 machines. The next week
tried only manual ways and was able to get 5 machines roughly by spending 2
hours daily.

The next Month I didn’t utilize the labs as I could wish.
Many machines in lab are not exploitable until you figure out vulnerability and
find a good working exploit against it. only at weekends I used to be in labs Roughly
I was able to get only 5-6 machines on whole month. One machine that I owned
this month was Pain which was very memorable as I had continuously worked on
this machine for more than a day and it was my 15th machine. After
that I couldn’t spend much time on the labs.

The third Month was a challenging month. I had only 16
machines owned (5 with metasploit) and had only a month left. I didn’t have any
target in mind but wanted to try each and every machine that is present in lab
before the lab ends.
So this month I again began to seriously spend some time for
labs. Each day and each machine taught me some new things. Some of the
memorable machines were Phoenix, Payday, Time, Beta, gamma, Gh0st etc.
There were hours and days when I used to work continuously
working on various machines but with no result. Learning more and trying more
and being patience is the key here.
You can experience all kind of machines in labs ranging from
different web application with various technologies like asp, php, cfm, java,
perl and other protocols like, SMB, SMTP, FTP, TFTP and client side attacks as
well. This includes machines which have dependency on other, so a good
post-exploitation can also be learned.

At the end of month 3 I was able to root 35+ machines. This Wow
moment when you see a shell and a root shell in the harder machines after
trying continuously for hours can only be felt and can’t be described here. So
try and feel yourself.
Before lab gets finished its better to take screenshot of at-least 10
machines and lab exercises if you would like to get Some Grace points in Exam.
There is no limit or prerequisites for exam. You can
schedule your exam even if you don’t hack any lab machine but it’s good to have
at-least 30 machines and have a lab and exam report ready if you are not
confident about your exam.

Talking about exam you need to get at-least 70 points out of
100 to clear ie. you need to hack 4 root out of 5 (or 3 low shells including a
25-mark machine and with 2 roots) in 23 hours 45 minutes.
I am not going to talk more about this brutal exam but all the best for trying out
Yourself and Don’t rely much on automated scripts that help in enumeration.

One thing to mention is Exam lab and course materials are
not only the things you should depend on; you should refer lot of external
resources to get more ideas, for eg in privilege
escalation I felt the materials are not much deeply covered in course
materials.

Not going to provide with lots of Links which is very deep  but Below resources which is very useful and you need to refer for fundamentals.

**Buffer Overflow**
Course Material is good and More in the below links

<http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=5>

**Metasploit**

**Enumeration**
Course Materials are good but more practice is required

As this blog is about
information  security. Lets see about it
first
Information security is
the process of protecting information from unauthorized persons in the world. A
basic definition can be “The protection of information and information systems
from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability”
The three main core
pillars of information security are C I A in short, where C I A are given below
·
Confidentiality
·
Integrity
·
Availability
**Confidentiality**
In information security,
Confidentiality means maintaining and assuring the data secrecy over its entire
life-cycle .An example of Confidentiality is military application where data has to
be kept secret. An hack in this kind of place may reveal the secrets of a
nation.
**Integrity**
In information
security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and
consistency of data over its entire life-cycle .An example of integrity is
banking transaction and e-commerce applications where integrity has to be
maintained .
**Availability**
For any information
system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is
needed. This means that the systems used to store and process the information, the
communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.
Ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attacks, such
as a flood of incoming messages to the target system essentially forcing it to
shut down
As in modern days  all information, transaction, communication
happens over the cyber world .it has been more important to protect it from
hackers who are growing day by day

**Hackers**

A hacker is a person
who tries to breaks into a computer or a network by exploiting the weakness
which may affect  the Confidentiality ,
integrity, availability of an information .The hackers intention of hack may
vary from profit ,fame, enjoyment ,etc.
There are various
classification with three main class of hackers :-
**Whitehat
hacker** :-  A whitehat
hacker breaks security to test their own security system or while working for a
security company which makes security software. The term "white hat"
in Internet also refers to an ethical hacker. These kind of hackers notifies
the manufacturer for patches to be applied .Thus having a good intention to contribute
to the security
**Blackhat
hacker**:- Black hat hackers break into secure networks to
destroy data or make the network unusable for those who are authorized to use
the network. Black hat hackers are also referred to as the "crackers"
within the security industry and by modern programmers. Crackers keep the
awareness of the vulnerabilities to themselves and do not notify the general
public or manufacturer for patches to be applied
**Greyhat
hacker**:- A grey hat hacker is both a black hat and a white
