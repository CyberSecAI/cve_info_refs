The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000396.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Jenkins bundled a vulnerable version of the `commons-httpclient` library. This version had a vulnerability (CVE-2012-6153) that incorrectly verified SSL certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect SSL certificate verification, which makes the system susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful MITM attack can potentially allow an attacker to intercept or modify data in transit.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack between the Jenkins server and other services it interacts with via HTTP/HTTPS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between Jenkins and the target service. This could be an attacker on the same network, or one that can control routing between the server and target.
