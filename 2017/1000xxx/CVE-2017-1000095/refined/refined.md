The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-1000095.

**CVE-2017-1000095**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Script Security Plugin's default list of approved signatures included unsafe methods that bypassed access restrictions implemented in the script sandbox. These methods allowed access to private data and circumvented the intended security model.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Inclusion of `DefaultGroovyMethods.putAt(Object, String, Object)` and `DefaultGroovyMethods.getAt(Object, String)` in the default approved signatures list, which allowed circumventing sandbox access restrictions.
    *   Inclusion of `groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Closure)` and `groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Object)` in the default approved signatures list, which allowed access to private data.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could bypass the sandbox security restrictions in the Script Security Plugin. This would allow them to access private data and perform actions that were not intended.
*  **Attack vectors**: Attackers could use specially crafted scripts, such as those in Pipeline jobs, to exploit these unsafe methods.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers would need to have the ability to create or modify scripts that integrate with Script Security.

The advisory states that the unsafe methods have been removed from the default approved signatures list and added to the list of dangerous signatures. Scripts that use these methods will now fail, and administrators will be warned that they are unsafe to approve.
