Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-1000409:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how `ld.so` (the dynamic loader of glibc) handles the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
- `ld.so` calculates the number of directories in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`nllp`) by parsing the original string. However, it uses an expanded version of the string (`llp_tmp`) to fill an array of directory pointers.
- Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs), specifically `$ORIGIN`, can introduce additional colons during the expansion of `llp_tmp` compared to the original `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` string. This results in more directory pointers being written than allocated, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `env_path_list.dirs` array, which stores pointers to library directories, is allocated based on the initial count of directories in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. However, the `fillin_rpath` function writes directory pointers based on the expanded path, which can contain additional directories due to the expansion of `$ORIGIN`. This discrepancy leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when writing to the `env_path_list.dirs` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By overflowing the `env_path_list.dirs` buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory. In the provided example, this is used to overwrite a NULL pointer with a pointer to the "cannot open shared object file" error message, which is allocated after the `env_path_list.dirs` buffer, which then leads to a crash when the loader tries to access this memory location. By controlling the contents of the overwritten memory, a crafted shared library can be loaded, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the vulnerability is triggered during the execution of a SUID binary, and if certain mitigations are not present, the attacker can achieve full root privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By causing a crash in `ld.so`, the attacker can cause the target application to terminate, thus leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker who has the ability to execute a vulnerable program on the system.
- **Environment Variable Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, using a carefully crafted value including `$ORIGIN`, to trigger the buffer overflow. The attacker also needs to be able to use the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to force loading a nonexistent library, and a second malicious library, to execute arbitrary code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a directory with colons in its path and create a hard link of a SUID binary inside of this directory. The system also must have `/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks` disabled.
- The attacker needs to be able to set environment variables, specifically `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_PRELOAD`.
- The attacker needs to be able to compile their own shared object and put it into a location where the process can load it.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability exists in glibc versions starting with 2.5 (released September 29, 2006).
- The vulnerability is not exploitable if the `/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks` setting is enabled, which prevents hard links from being created in directories with colons.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable if the glibc is patched against CVE-2017-1000366, as this patch ignores the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_HWCAP_MASK` environment variables for SUID binaries.
- The provided content includes example exploits for Debian 9 (i386) and CentOS 7 (i386).
