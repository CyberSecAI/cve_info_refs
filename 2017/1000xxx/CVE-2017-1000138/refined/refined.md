- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when creating a page title. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the page title when displaying it in a collection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view the collection containing the malicious page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves creating a page with a malicious title containing JavaScript code, and then adding that page to a collection that is viewed by other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of creating pages and collections. The attacker also needs to entice other users to view the collection containing the malicious page.
