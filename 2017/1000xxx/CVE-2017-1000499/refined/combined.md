[January 9, 2018August 14, 2022](https://cyberworldmirror.com/vulnerability-phpmyadmin-lets-attacker-perform-drop-table-single-click/)[Ashutosh Barot](https://cyberworldmirror.com/author/ashutosh-barot/)
### [This Vulnerability in phpMyAdmin Lets An Attacker Perform DROP TABLE With A Single Click!](https://cyberworldmirror.com/vulnerability-phpmyadmin-lets-attacker-perform-drop-table-single-click/)

Most of you are familiar about Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, it is one of the most common vulnerabilities; it was listed in OWASP Top 10 â 2013.

Previously, I had found and reported CSRF in an Intel website, by exploiting that vulnerability an attacker could remove items from an authenticated userâs shopping cart. such actions are common attack scenarios regarding CSRF.

In this case (phpMyAdmin), a database admin/Developer can be tricked into performing database operations like DROP TABLE using CSRF. It can cause devastating incidents! The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a crafted URL to the victim and if she (authenticated user) clicks it, the victim may perform a DROP TABLE query on her database.

**What is phpMyAdmin?**
phpMyAdmin is a free and open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB. As a portable web application written primarily in PHP, it has become one of the most popular MySQL administration tools, especially for web hosting providers using cPanel.

phpMyAdmin is widely used to manage the database for various websites created with WordPress, Joomla and many other CMS.

**What is CSRF vulnerability?**

CSRF stands for Cross Site Request Forgery.

According to OWASP, âA CSRF attack forces a logged-on victimâs browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victimâs session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victimâs browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim. â

In simple terms, An attacker can create a crafted URL and lure the victims (with active session) to perform dangerous operations without their knowledge.

CSRF is a critical vulnerability and was listed in OWASP Top 10 -2013. A feature of phpMyAdmin was using a GET request and after that POST request for Database operations such as DROP TABLE table\_name; GET requests must be protected against CSRF attacks. In this case, POST requests were used which were sent through URL (for bookmarking purpose may be); it was possible for an attacker to trick a database admin into clicking a button and perform a drop table database query of the attackerâs choice. However, it is difficult for a remote attacker to gather these information to craft a URL.

I also found that post requests could be converted into GET requests using burpâs âchange request methodâ feature. and it could be executed directly from a URL even after removing the token. by using this method, I was able to add a working wordpress admin user. an attacker would need cPanel session id and database name. other table names likeÂ *wp\_users*Â can be guessed easily.

The URL for performing database operations was being saved in browser history. If a user executes a query on the database by clicking insert, DROP etc. buttons,Â *the URL will contain database name and table name.*Â This vulnerability can result into disclosure of sensitive information as the URL is stored at various places such as browser history, SIEM logs, Firewall Logs, ISP Logs etc.

This CSRF attack worked even when the user was authenticated in cPanel and phpMyAdmin was closed after use. In order to exploit this vulnerability, user interaction is required. so, severity for this vulnerability is Medium.

Hereâs the proof of concept video for this vulnerability:

Know More About CSRF from OWASP:

[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site\_Request\_Forgery\_(CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29)

The vulnerability is patched now. So, I request all the phpMyAdmin users to update it to v 4.7.7 or newer.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Download

Many operating systems already include a phpMyAdmin package and will
automatically keep it updated, however these versions are sometimes
slightly outdated and therefore may be missing the latest features.
Additionally, the configuration process varies widely by package and
may not adhere to the official phpMyAdmin documentation. That being said,
it is usually the quickest and easiest way of keeping an updated installation. Please contact your OS
vendor for more information. Some additional information is also available [in our documentation](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html). If you just want to
try phpMyAdmin in a virtual machine, you might want to check the [available software appliances which provide
phpMyAdmin](#appliances).

If you do not find a suitable package or wish to install your own phpMyAdmin,
you can download one of the following
kits. Please note that each version has requirements for the minimum PHP
and MySQL versions.

Since July 2015 all phpMyAdmin releases are cryptographically signed by the
releasing developer. You should verify that the signature matches the archive
you have downloaded. Verification instructions are placed in our
documentation in the [Verifying phpMyAdmin releases](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#verifying-phpmyadmin-releases) chapter.

## About

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in [PHP](https://php.net/),
intended to handle the administration of [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and
MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables,
columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the
user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

[![phpMyAdmin book](/static/images/books/pma_en_3.4_150x185.png)
![phpMyAdmin Starter](/static/images/books/pma_starter_150x184.jpg)](/docs/#books)

phpMyAdmin comes with a wide range of [documentation](/docs/) and users are welcome to
update [our wiki pages](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki) to share ideas and
howtos for various operations. The [phpMyAdmin team](/team/) will try to help you if
you face any problem; you can use a [variety of support channels](/support/) to get
help.

phpMyAdmin is also very deeply documented in a book written by one of the developers
â [Mastering phpMyAdmin for
Effective MySQL Management](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-phpmyadmin-34-effective-mysql-management), which is available in English and [Spanish](/docs/#books).

To ease usage to a wide range of people, phpMyAdmin is being translated into [72 languages](/translations/) and supports both LTR
and RTL languages.

phpMyAdmin is a mature project with a stable and flexible code
base; you can find out more about the [project and its history](/about/) and the [awards](/awards/) it earned. When the project turned 15, we published a [celebration page](/15-years/).

The phpMyAdmin project is a member of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org). SFC is a not-for-profit organization that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.

 [About this capture](#expand)

COLLECTED BY

Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Collection: [ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler](https://archive.org/details/archivebot)

ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).

To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <http://www.archivebot.com>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot>.
