Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-1000499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in phpMyAdmin. The application was not sufficiently protecting against CSRF attacks when performing database operations. Specifically, it allowed POST requests to be sent via the URL, which could then be converted into GET requests, making it easy for an attacker to craft malicious URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application did not implement proper measures to prevent CSRF attacks. This allowed an attacker to create malicious links that, when clicked by an authenticated user, would perform unintended actions.
*   **GET Request for Sensitive Operations:** The vulnerability was exacerbated by the fact that sensitive database operations (like DROP TABLE) could be triggered via a GET request after a POST request was manipulated, making it easy to exploit.
*   **Sensitive Data in URL:** Database name and table names were included in the URL, which was stored in browser history, SIEM logs, firewall logs etc, causing information disclosure

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could trick a database administrator into executing harmful SQL queries, such as deleting records, dropping or truncating tables, or modifying data.
*   **Data Loss:**  Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to data loss and corruption as tables can be dropped or truncated.
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker could add a new admin user in a wordpress database.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Database and table names are exposed in the URL which could potentially expose the database structure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing SQL queries to be executed and sends to the victim.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick the victim into clicking the crafted URL, typically through email, chat, or malicious website.
*   **Browser History/Logs:** URLs containing sensitive data were being saved in browser history, SIEM logs, etc. which can lead to information disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of target:** The attacker needs knowledge of the target database and table names, though table names like *wp_users* can be easily guessed.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker requires the victim to have an active phpMyAdmin session and to click on the crafted link.
* **(Optional) cPanel access:** An attacker would need the cPanel session ID, database name and the target table name in order to construct the URL for exploiting the CSRF vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is patched in phpMyAdmin version 4.7.7 and later.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ashutosh Barot, who also published proof-of-concept exploit demonstrations, demonstrating the impact of the vulnerability with actions including dropping a table.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for significant data loss and corruption.
*   The provided exploit examples also show the possibility of adding a new admin user, arbitrary file writes and data exfiltration via DNS.
