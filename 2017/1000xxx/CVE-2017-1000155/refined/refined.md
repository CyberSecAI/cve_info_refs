- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `thumb.php` script, used to display user profile icons, did not properly check access permissions when retrieving icons by ID. It allowed users to view profile icons that were not set as default, even if they were not intended to be publicly viewable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access control and missing authorization checks within the `thumb.php` script. Specifically, the script failed to verify if the requesting user had the right to access a profile icon that is not the default one.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can view non-default profile images of other users without proper authorization. This could lead to the disclosure of potentially private or unintended images, violating user privacy.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user could construct a specific URL with `thumb.php` to access non-default profile icons by ID by manipulating the `id` parameter in the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the platform, and they need to know the ID of the non-default profile image.
