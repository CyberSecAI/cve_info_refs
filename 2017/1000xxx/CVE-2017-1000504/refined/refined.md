Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000504:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition during Jenkins startup can cause commands to be executed in the wrong order during initialization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF protection is not effective immediately after startup. There is a short window where the "Please wait..." message is no longer shown, but CSRF protection is not yet active.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit the lack of CSRF protection to perform unauthorized actions while Jenkins is starting up. The advisory states that this has not been confirmed but recommends users upgrade.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks targeting the Jenkins web interface during the brief window between the "Please wait..." message disappearing and CSRF protection becoming active.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the Jenkins instance during the specific vulnerable window of time during startup. The attacker does not require authentication, as the vulnerability exists before the authentication and authorization mechanisms are fully active.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2017-1000503, which also involves a race condition during Jenkins startup, but leads to a different set of issues.
- The advisory rates this vulnerability as high, using the CVSS score of [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). While this provides a good base assessment, the 'high' severity is likely due to the potential to cause complete compromise of a Jenkins instance.
- The fix involves upgrading to Jenkins 2.95 (main line) or 2.89.2 (LTS).
