- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not invalidate existing password reset links when a user changes their primary email address or password through account settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate session management and password reset link invalidation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has previously compromised a user's account can regain access even after the user changes their password and primary email, by using a stored password reset link.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have gained initial access to the victim's account. Then change the primary email, request a password reset email, and then the victim changes their password and primary email back. The attacker can use the stored password reset link to regain access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have already compromised the victim's Mahara account.
