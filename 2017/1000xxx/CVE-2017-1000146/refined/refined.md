- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly escape the page title when updating the "add to watchlist" link via AJAX on the artefact detail screen. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page title.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1.  An attacker creates or edits a portfolio page.
    2.  The attacker includes malicious JavaScript code within the page's title (e.g., `<img src=0 onerror=alert(location)>`).
    3.  A victim views the page in display mode and then accesses the artefact detail screen for an image on the page.
    4.  When the victim interacts with the "add to watchlist" link, the injected JavaScript in the page title is executed due to the lack of proper escaping.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have an account on the application and the ability to create or edit a page title.
    - The victim needs to be logged into the application to have access to the watchlist feature.
