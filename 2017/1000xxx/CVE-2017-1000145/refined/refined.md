- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the logic that determines whether to enable anonymous comments on artefact pages within Mahara. Specifically, the code checks only if comments are allowed on a page, and not if the global setting for anonymous comments is disabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The main weakness is the improper check for anonymous comments. The system allows anonymous comments on artefact pages of publicly shared pages even if anonymous comments are disabled at the site level. This bypasses the intended access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is that users can leave anonymous comments on artefacts even when the site configuration restricts such comments. This can lead to a loss of control over comment sections and the potential for unwanted or malicious content.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through publicly shared pages. An attacker, by navigating to a public page with comments enabled and then accessing an individual artefact (e.g., an image) on that page can leave an anonymous comment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no special access or privileges beyond the ability to browse to a public page. The attacker must be able to view a public page that allows comments and then access an individual artefact on that page.
