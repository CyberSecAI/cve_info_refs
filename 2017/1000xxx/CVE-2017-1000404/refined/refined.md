Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Delivery Pipeline Plugin used the unescaped content of the `fullscreen` query parameter in its JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin directly used the value of the `fullscreen` query parameter without sanitization or proper encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
*   Session hijacking
*   Stealing cookies or other sensitive information
*   Defacing the web page
*   Redirecting the user to a malicious site
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
A specially crafted URL with malicious JavaScript injected into the `fullscreen` parameter is used as the attack vector. The attacker would need to entice the victim to click on the malicious link or otherwise load the crafted URL in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the Jenkins server to exploit this vulnerability. The attack is entirely client-side, requiring only the ability to craft a malicious URL and trick the victim into accessing it through their web browser. The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to click the link or somehow load it in the user's browser, such as through embedding the link on an attacker controlled website.
