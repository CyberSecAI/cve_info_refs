```
conf/global.php -
          Increment version +1

cron/watchdog.php -
          Remove linking transaction ID's. With clan bank transfers (Hacker 2 Clan or Clan 2 Hacker) the original logic no longer works as there is now two seperate database and ID' are not one after (or below) the other.

game/guest/lgin.htm -
           Added validation for IP addresses (see game/guest/reg.htm)

game/guest/rebuild.htm
          Alert that the site is down but link off to the bugtracking page on GitHub

game/guest/reg.htm -
           Added ip validation
           Use POST over REQUEST for username, password, and email checks.
            Added username validation and sanitation
            Fixed a known bug that if the user didn't create a bank account first then they did not recieve any money for small jobs done before visiting the bank page for the first time. (Bank registration was an unnecessary complication and should already be handled on account registration.)
               Fixes [#4](https://github.com/booth-f/openhacker/issues/4) (lgin.htm too)

game/main/user/bank.htm -
          Added a missing end tag for the Send Cash form.

game/main/user/banksend.htm -
          Added sanitation on extra details message for bank transactions
          Added validation to sent amount
          Added logic to send money from Hacker to Clan
          Fixes [#5](https://github.com/booth-f/openhacker/issues/5)

game/main/user/clanbank.htm -
          Phased out old button
          Added the radio toggle between Hacker or Clan

game/main/clanbankin.htm -
          Sanitized clan password input
          Fixes [#6](https://github.com/booth-f/openhacker/issues/6)

game/main/user/clanbanksend.htm -
          Added sanitation on extra details message for bank transactions
          Added validation to sent amount
          Removed sameid limitation for C 2 H transactions
          Added display for C 2 C coming soon

game/main/user/clanroster.htm -
          Added logic for clan member status (regular member or council member)

game/main/user/updateacc.htm -
         Added sanitization to bio. Utilized htmlpurifier to allow for minimal html to be added (user can format their bios)
         Note: htmlpurifier sits outside web root (SEE index.php)
         Fixed old redirect location url

index.php -
         Added additional header modification cases
         Require the HTMLPurifier (Seperate download not contained in this repository)

layout/guest/header.htm -
           Removed old starting html logic (no longer needed and handled inside index.php

layout/main/footer.htm -
           Formatting issue

layout/main/header.htm -
           Changed Cryptocurrenty to Crypto-Market (Planned feature)

## Description

[![@Ali-Albakara](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11718364?v=4&size=48)](/Ali-Albakara)[Ali-Albakara](https://github.com/Ali-Albakara)opened [on Sep 19, 2017](https://github.com/booth-f/openhacker/issues/5#issue-258901106)
```
$RecUser=$_POST['recvusername']; -- Not sanitized, used in a query later, used in a message later. SQL Injection & XSS.
$details .= $_POST['details']; -- XSS, used in the message later.

```

Logic problem:

To deduce the amount the hacker is sending to another hacker, the amount is being multiplied by -1, so if he's sending 5000, the game treats it as if its -5000. What happens if the original amount I sent is -5000 and it gets multiplied by -1? It turns into a positive integer (5000) and I gain free cash.
