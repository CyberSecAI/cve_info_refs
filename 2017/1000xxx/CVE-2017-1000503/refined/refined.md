- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition during Jenkins startup could result in the wrong order of execution of commands during initialization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The race condition can cause the setup wizard to fail, resulting in:
    - No security realm defined and no admin user created.
    - Authorization strategy set to "Anyone can do anything".
    - TCP port for JNLP agents open.
    - CLI over Remoting enabled.
    - CSRF protection disabled.
    - Agent to Controller Access Control disabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain complete control over the Jenkins instance because it is left in an insecure state where anyone can perform any action and there are no administrative credentials set up.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability occurs during the startup process, so an attacker would need to be present when the instance is being initialized (or know that the instance failed to initialize properly).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need network access to the Jenkins instance after startup and be able to exploit the lack of security measures.
