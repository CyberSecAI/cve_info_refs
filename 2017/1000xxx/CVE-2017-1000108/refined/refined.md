Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000108:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root cause:** The Pipeline: Input Step Plugin allowed users with Item/Read access to a pipeline to interact with the input step, which was not the intended behavior.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient permission checks for interacting with the input step in pipelines.
*   **Impact:** Users with only read access to a pipeline could interact with input steps, potentially modifying or influencing the pipeline execution flow.
*   **Attack vector:** A user with Item/Read access to a pipeline could interact with the input step.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Item/Read permissions for the affected pipeline in Jenkins.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by changing the required permission to Item/Build by default, preventing unauthorized users from interacting with input steps.
*   This vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-576 in the Jenkins advisory.
