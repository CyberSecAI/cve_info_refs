{
  "cve": "CVE-2017-1000381",
  "description": "The c-ares function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`, which is used for parsing NAPTR responses, could be triggered to read memory outside of the given input buffer if the passed in DNS response packet was crafted in a particular way.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient data length check in `ares_parse_naptr_reply()` when parsing NAPTR responses.",
    "weakness": "The function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()` does not properly validate the length of the NAPTR record, leading to potential out-of-bounds read.",
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious DNS response packet that, when parsed by `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`, causes the program to read memory outside of the intended buffer, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure.",
    "attack_vector": "A crafted DNS response packet.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted DNS response to the vulnerable system."

  "affected_versions": {
    "affected": "c-ares 1.8.0 to and including 1.12.0",
    "fixed": "c-ares >= 1.13.0"
