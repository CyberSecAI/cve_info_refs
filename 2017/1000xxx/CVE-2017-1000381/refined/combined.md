# c-ares NAPTR parser out of bounds access

# c-ares NAPTR parser out of bounds access

Project c-ares Security Advisory, June 20, 2017 -
[Permalink](https://c-ares.org/adv_20170620.html)

## VULNERABILITY

The c-ares function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`, which is used for parsing
NAPTR responses, could be triggered to read memory outside of the given input
buffer if the passed in DNS response packet was crafted in a particular way.

We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2017-1000381 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

This flaw exists in the following c-ares versions.

* Affected versions: c-ares 1.8.0 to and including 1.12.0
* Not affected versions: c-ares >= 1.13.0

## THE SOLUTION

In version 1.13.0, the `RR_len` value gets checked properly and the function
is also added to the fuzz testing. It was previously accidentally left out
from that.

A [patch for CVE-2017-1000381](https://c-ares.org/CVE-2017-1000381.patch)
is available.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade c-ares to version 1.13.0

B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

C - Do not use `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`.

## TIME LINE

It was reported to the c-ares project on May 20. We contacted distros@openall
on June 16.

c-ares 1.13.0 was released on June 20 2017, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CREDITS

Thanks to LCatro for the report and to David Drysdale for the fix.
