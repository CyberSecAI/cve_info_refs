# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Security Notes

This release fixes 3 security vulnerabilities. (CVEs pending)

1. [[CVE-2017-1000490](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qpgw-2c72-4c89 "CVE-2017-1000490")] Closed a vulnerability in Filemanager that allowed an authorized Mautic user to download any file from the web server that the web user had access to using `....//` in the URL's path GET parameter. It was only possible to leverage this vulnerability if already logged into Mautic. Reported by [@pahan12](https://github.com/pahan12)
2. [[CVE-2017-1000489](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6x98-fx9j-7c78 "CVE-2017-1000489")] If using a 3rd party SSO plugin, it was possible to still login if email address matched even if the user was disabled. This is now fixed to deny access to disabled users logging in through SSO.
3. [[CVE-2017-1000488](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjhr-c23f-w76q "CVE-2017-1000488")] Closed an inline JS XSS vulnerability in Mautic landing pages with a Mautic form embedded. Using the feature to pre-populate form values using GET parameters, it was possible to inject script using something like `?first_name=%22%20onfocus=%22alert(123)`.
