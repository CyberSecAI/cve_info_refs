  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Recursive include operation triggered by crafted parameters when editing table data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Recursive include vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to the recursive nature of the include operation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted parameters in deep phpMyAdmin links, likely during table editing operations.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to craft malicious URLs or parameters when interacting with phpMyAdmin's table editing functionality. The attacker would likely need a phpMyAdmin interface and some method to send crafted links to the victim user, possibly through a third-party site."
