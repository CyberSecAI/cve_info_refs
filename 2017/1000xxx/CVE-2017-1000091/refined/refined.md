The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2017-1000091:

**Vulnerability:** CSRF vulnerability and insufficient permission checks allow capturing credentials in GitHub Branch Source Plugin

**Root cause:** The GitHub Branch Source Plugin connects to a user-specified GitHub API URL as part of form validation and completion. This functionality had insufficient permission checks, allowing any user with Overall/Read access to connect to any web server and send credentials with a known ID. Also, it did not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Improper permission checks: Allowed users with `Overall/Read` access to perform actions that should require higher permissions.
- CSRF vulnerability: Lack of POST request enforcement, enabling attacks via Cross-Site Request Forgery.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Credentials exposure: Attackers could potentially capture credentials by connecting to a malicious server and sending credentials with a known ID.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: Attacker sends requests to the vulnerable Jenkins instance.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The vulnerability can be exploited via CSRF due to the lack of POST request enforcement.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker can trick a user into triggering the vulnerable request.
