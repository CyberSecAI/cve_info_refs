# Favorite

How to install

* [Documentation](/favorite/)
* [Releases](/favorite/releases/)
* [Issues](/favorite/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/favorite/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/favorite/healthscore/)

This plugin allows you to mark a job a favorite. This is controlled via a list view column you need to add to a view. You can then click on a star to favorite or unfavorite a job. There is also a job filter to allow you to create a view that only shows your favorites.

#### Precaution

Older versions of this plugin may not be safe to use. Please review the following warnings before using an older version:

* [Missing permission check allows anyone to change favorites for any other user](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-06-06/)
* [CSRF vulnerability allows changing another user's favorites](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-06-06/)

## Configuration

It is recommended you change your default view to either one you create, or follow the directions in [Editing or Replacing the All View](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Editing%2Bor%2BReplacing%2Bthe%2BAll%2BView) to allow the Favorite column to show up. Once you have the Favorite column, it will show a star that logged in users will be able to click to make a favorite. You can also add another view, and apply the "Favorites Filter" to show favorites only in that view.

## Theme Developer Notice

## Development

### Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed on your system.

* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Build

Build the `target/favorite.hpi` plugin file with the `mvn package` command.

### Run

Startup Jenkins with the Plugin.

```
mvn clean hpi:run
```

Now go to <http://localhost:8080/jenkins> and test the Plugin. You might need to update plugins via GUI.

Install the plugins `Pipeline` and `Folders` to test that favoriting these kind of items work without problems.

Remember to clean the `work` dir if something strange is happening, like plugin is not reloaded.

```
rm -rf work/*
```

### Pre Release Tests

**Testcase 1: Favorite Column on Job List Page**

* You are on the Job List Page and have created at least one Build Job.
* On the right a column `F` needs to show up and show a grey star for the job.
* With a click on the grey star the star turns golden and the job is added as favorite.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-06-06

This advisory announces multiple vulnerabilities in the [Favorite Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/favorite).

## Description

### Missing permission check in Favorite Plugin allows anyone to change favorites for any other user

**JENKINS-44643 / CVE-2017-1000243**

A missing permission check allowed any user to add or remove favorites for any other user.

The API was changed so users cannot change another user’s favorites, only their own.

### CSRF vulnerability in Favorite Plugin allows changing another user’s favorites

**SECURITY-532 / CVE-2017-1000244**

An API used to add and remove a favorite was vulnerable to CSRF, allowing attackers to change the victim’s favorites.

The API now requires requests to be sent via POST, which is subject to the CSRF protection configurable in Jenkins global security configuration.

## Severity

* JENKINS-44643: **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)**
* SECURITY-532: **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)**

## Affected versions

* JENKINS-44643: Favorite Plugin up to and including 2.1.0.
* SECURITY-532: Favorite Plugin up to and including 2.2.0.

## Fix

* Users of Favorite Plugin should update it to version 2.3.0 or newer.

## Credit

The Jenkins project would like to thank the reporter for discovering and [reporting](/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities) this vulnerability:

* **Andres Rodriguez, CloudBees, Inc.** for SECURITY-532
