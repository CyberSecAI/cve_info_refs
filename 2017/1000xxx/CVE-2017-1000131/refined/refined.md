The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000131.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of implementation of the "kill_child" API method in Mahara when using MNet for Single Sign-On (SSO) with a remote Identity Provider (IdP). This method is supposed to be invoked by the IdP to log users out of connected service providers (like Mahara) when the user logs out of the IdP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Failure to implement the MNet "kill_child" API method, which is required for proper single logout (SLO) functionality.
- This results in a session management issue where users remain logged into Mahara even after logging out of the remote IdP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users remain logged into Mahara after logging out of the IdP, potentially leading to unauthorized access if the user leaves the session active.
- Creates a security vulnerability where a user could access the Mahara site using an already logged-in session, even after their session at the IdP is terminated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user logs out from the remote IdP while having an active session on the Mahara platform via SSO using MNet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker is not necessarily external.
- The attacker needs to be a user who has logged in via MNet SSO between an IdP (e.g. Moodle) and Mahara.
- The attacker could be someone who has access to a machine where a user logged in via SSO and did not properly log out, or someone who exploits the session management flaw to gain access after the user logs out from the IdP.
