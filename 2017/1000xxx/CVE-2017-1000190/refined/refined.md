Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-1000190 (based on the provided content referring to the issue as an "XXE vulnerability in SimpleXML #18", which is related to the reported CVE).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from SimpleXML's failure to disable the resolving of external entities in XML documents when deserializing them. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML containing references to external entities which are then resolved by the SimpleXML parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection. SimpleXML processes XML documents and allows external entity definitions to be declared in the DOCTYPE element and used in the text nodes of elements, which leads to external entity resolution.
-  **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The library doesn't sanitize or disable the resolving of external entities when processing XML documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system by using `file:///` protocol.
- **Remote File Inclusion:** The attacker can also fetch resources from remote servers (http, gopher, dict protocols). This can be used for further attacks.
- **Potential DoS:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service by trying to resolve extremely large files or by exhausting system resources through recursive entity resolution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious XML document. This XML document includes a DOCTYPE declaration that defines an external entity pointing to a file (local or remote) they want to read or include.
- The attacker then supplies this malicious XML to the SimpleXML library for deserialization.
- When SimpleXML parses the document, it resolves the external entity, causing it to read the file or fetch remote resources, and includes the content in the parsed document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply untrusted XML data to an application using SimpleXML library for deserialization.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the server as the vulnerability is exploited through XML injection.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of XXE vulnerabilities and craft XML to exploit them.

**Additional Details:**
- The report specifically mentions that SimpleXML does not resolve external entities within XML attributes, but it does resolve them in the text nodes of the XML elements.
-  The provided example shows how to read a local file (`win.ini`) using the `file:///` protocol.
- The report also mentions that this vulnerability affects Retrofit library because it uses SimpleXML internally.
- The reporter provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) in a `.txt` file to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The reporter suggests to limit the resolving of external entities in XML document to fix the vulnerability.
