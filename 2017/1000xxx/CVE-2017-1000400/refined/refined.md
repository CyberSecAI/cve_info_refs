- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jenkins remote API at `/job/(job-name)/api` was disclosing information about upstream and downstream projects that the current user did not have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure due to insufficient access control on the job API endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to information about jobs that they would otherwise not be able to see.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the Jenkins instance via the API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have Overall/Read permissions to access the `/job/(job-name)/api` remote API, but not necessarily Job/Read permissions for the specific upstream/downstream jobs being disclosed.
