The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000113.

**Root Cause:**
The Deploy to container Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Unencrypted storage of passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of plain text passwords, allowing unauthorized access to the systems or services protected by those credentials.
- Users with Jenkins controller local file system access or users with Extended Read access to the jobs it is used in could retrieve the password, e.g. through the `config.xml` URL.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local file system access to the Jenkins controller.
- Access to the job's `config.xml` via a URL, potentially achievable by users with "Extended Read" permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local file system access to the Jenkins controller or Extended Read access to the jobs using the plugin.
