Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Mautic handles pre-populating form values using GET parameters on landing pages with embedded Mautic forms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an inline JavaScript XSS. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input that is passed through GET parameters used to pre-populate form fields, leading to the injection of malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when a user visits a vulnerable landing page, which can lead to account hijacking, data theft or further malicious actions against the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **GET Parameter Injection:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with a GET parameter containing the malicious JavaScript payload. For example, `?first_name=%22%20onfocus=%22alert(123)` injects a JavaScript alert into the "first\_name" field.
*   **Mautic Landing Pages:** The vulnerability is specific to landing pages where Mautic forms are embedded.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires that a user visits the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious URL targeting a vulnerable Mautic landing page.
*   **No Privileges Required:** No specific user privileges on the Mautic instance are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** Mautic versions 2.1.0 through 2.11.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability was fixed in Mautic version 2.12.0.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is classified as having a moderate severity.
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.1
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **EPSS Score:** 0.121%
