Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2017-1000105:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Blue Ocean plugin did not properly check the optional `Run/Artifacts` permission before granting access to archived artifacts. It only required `Item/Read` permission, which is insufficient when the optional permission is enabled using a Java system property.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient permission check:** The plugin failed to enforce the `Run/Artifacts` permission, allowing unauthorized users to access archived artifacts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Users with only `Item/Read` access could access archived artifacts, which they should not be able to view without the `Run/Artifacts` permission. This may lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to have at least `Item/Read` permission.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid account on the Jenkins instance with at least `Item/Read` permissions.
*   The optional Run/Artifacts permission must be enabled on the instance using a java system property.
