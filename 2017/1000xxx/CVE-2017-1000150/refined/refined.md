- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `session_regenerate_id()` function, which is intended to change the session ID upon login, was not working correctly in Mahara 15.04 and later versions. This was due to changes in `htdocs/auth/session.php` designed to prevent session locking issues with AJAX scripts. These changes caused `session_start()` and `session_write_close()` to be called multiple times, interfering with `session_regenerate_id()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the failure to regenerate session IDs upon user login or logout. This makes session hijacking easier, as an attacker can potentially reuse an old session ID to gain unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to hijack a legitimate user's session. This would grant the attacker the same access and permissions as the victim, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves session hijacking. An attacker could obtain a user's session ID through various means (e.g., sniffing network traffic, malware, or social engineering), then use that ID to impersonate the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to obtain a valid session ID of a user, which could be done through network monitoring, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or using social engineering techniques.
