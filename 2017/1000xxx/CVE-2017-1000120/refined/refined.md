Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-1000120:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the direct injection of unfiltered user input into an SQL query within the `get_users` function in the `frappe/share.py` file. This occurs due to the use of Python's string formatting (`.format()`) to construct the SQL query, instead of using parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The `fields` parameter of the `get_users` function is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the input received through the `fields` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Disclosure:** A successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, password hashes (salts and hashes of passwords), and any other information stored in database tables. As demonstrated in the provided exploit, the attacker can retrieve data from the `__Auth` table which contains login details.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosed information could potentially be used to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network, through HTTP requests.
*   **Whitelisted Function:** The vulnerable `get_users` function is whitelisted, meaning it can be accessed by any authenticated user, regardless of their privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the vulnerable Frappe application. No special privileges are required, as the `get_users` function is whitelisted.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send HTTP requests to the Frappe application.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoint and required parameters for the `frappe.share.get_users` method.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided blog post includes a proof-of-concept exploit using `curl` and provides a multistage attack by combining with XSS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 7.1.29 of the Frappe framework.
*   The blog post also mentions a stored XSS vulnerability, however, this is not related to CVE-2017-1000120.
