The content is related to CVE-2017-1000047.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from rbenv's method of determining the Ruby version to use. It searches for a `.ruby-version` file by traversing up the directory tree. The Ruby version specified in `.ruby-version` may contain path traversal sequences, allowing an attacker to specify a `ruby` binary outside of the user's home directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability in the `.ruby-version` file parsing.
- Lack of sanitization or validation of the Ruby version specified in the `.ruby-version` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can control which `ruby` binary is executed, allowing them to run malicious code with the privileges of the user executing the script.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker plants a malicious `.ruby-version` file in a directory that a user will access via a script execution or by changing the current working directory using `cd`.
- The attacker can create a directory structure with the malicious `.ruby-version` file and a malicious `ruby` executable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to write to the file system in locations accessible during rbenv's upward traversal, such as `/tmp`.
- The user must execute a Ruby script from a directory or have their current working directory be a path where an attacker-controlled `.ruby-version` file is found.
