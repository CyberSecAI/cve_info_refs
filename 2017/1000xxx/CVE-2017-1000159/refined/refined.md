Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-1000159:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of filenames when printing DVI files to PDF using the `dvipdfm` tool within the Evince document viewer.
*   Specifically, Evince was using `g_strdup_printf` to construct the command line for `dvipdfm`, including the DVI filename directly without proper sanitization or quoting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The direct inclusion of the filename in the command line without proper escaping or quoting allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.  By crafting a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters (e.g., semicolons, backticks, dollar signs, etc), an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system when a user attempts to print the DVI document to PDF.
*   The `dvipdfm` tool, when used with the `-D` option, allows execution of arbitrary commands. By including `-D` and a command in the filename, this could be exploited to run commands when a DVI file is processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running Evince.  This could allow the attacker to compromise the system, install malware, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DVI File:** An attacker could create or modify a DVI file so it contains a specially crafted filename. This could be achieved by renaming the file or manipulating it before it is opened by Evince.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to open and print a malicious DVI file within Evince to trigger the command injection. This could be via email, web downloads, or other file sharing methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the system; the vulnerability can be exploited remotely by enticing a user to open a crafted file.
*   **File Creation/Modification:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a DVI file and its associated name to embed malicious commands.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs a method to convince the user to open the specially crafted file using the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the DVI backend of Evince and was triggered when exporting or printing to PDF.
*   The fix involved using `g_shell_quote` to properly escape the filename, and adding `--` to the `dvipdfm` command to separate options from filenames.  This prevents the filename from being interpreted as further options.
*   Some discussions in the bug report also suggest using `g_spawn_sync` to avoid the need for manual argument escaping.
*   The issue was also present in `atril`, the MATE document viewer, which uses a similar code base to Evince.
*   Several Debian security advisories (DSA) and long term support (DLA) advisories were issued to address this vulnerability.
