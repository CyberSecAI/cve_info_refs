The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2017-1000093:

**CVE-2017-1000093:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Poll SCM Plugin did not require POST requests for its API, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** CSRF vulnerability. The plugin's API could be accessed using GET requests, rather than requiring POST requests.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could initiate polling of projects with a known name without proper authorization. This circumvents the plugin's intended permission model by allowing unauthorized users to trigger polling actions, which should require specific permissions.
*   **Attack Vector:** CSRF attack. An attacker can craft a malicious link or web page that triggers a polling action on a vulnerable Jenkins instance when a logged-in user with access to the Jenkins instance interacts with it.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need direct access to the Jenkins instance but needs a user with the ability to configure jobs in Jenkins to click on a crafted URL or otherwise interact with a malicious resource provided by the attacker. The attacker also needs to know the name of the project to trigger a polling.
