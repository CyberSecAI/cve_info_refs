Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-1000373:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2017-1000373" multiple times.
*   It describes the vulnerability related to the `qsort()` function, which aligns with the CVE description which refers to a stack clash vulnerability in qsort().
*   The provided exploit code `OpenBSD_at.c` is specifically designed for CVE-2017-1000373.
*   The OpenBSD cvsweb content refers to the vulnerable `qsort.c`.
*   The advisory from qualys is directly related to CVE-2017-1000373

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flawed implementation of the `qsort()` function in OpenBSD (and other BSD systems). Instead of always recursing on the smaller partition of the array, it always recursed on the first sub-partition and iterated on the second, irrespective of size. This could lead to excessive stack usage for specially crafted pathological arrays.
*   The lack of proper stack space management combined with a recursive algorithm that does not account for the size of its sub-partitions could lead to stack overflows.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Recursion:**  The recursive nature of `qsort()` without an appropriate guard against large inputs allows for a deep recursion that consumes excessive stack space.
*   **Stack Clash:** The vulnerability exploits the way the stack grows downwards and can collide with other memory regions, leading to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.
*   **Incorrect Partitioning Strategy:** In a correctly implemented qsort, the smaller partition should be sorted first, reducing recursion and memory usage. The bug causes the function to recurse on the first partition and iterate on the second partition.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The primary impact is a stack overflow due to deep recursion, leading to a crash.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious user can trigger the vulnerability, causing a DoS by exhausting the stack space.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** As demonstrated in the Qualys advisory, this can be combined with other stack-clash techniques to gain control of the instruction pointer and achieve privilege escalation. Specifically on OpenBSD, where the stack guard page can be disabled by manipulating the RLIMIT_STACK, the stack clash vulnerability can be exploited more easily.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. They must be able to execute programs that utilize the vulnerable `qsort()` function with specially crafted inputs.
*   **Pathological Input:** The core attack vector relies on crafting specific input arrays that force the vulnerable `qsort()` function to recurse deeply.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.
*   **Ability to Control `qsort()` Input:** The attacker must be able to influence the data that is sorted by the `qsort()` function or an application that uses it.
*   **Understanding of Stack Layout and Memory Allocation:** Successful exploitation, especially for privilege escalation, requires an understanding of how memory is allocated and how the stack is managed.
*   On OpenBSD, the attacker can set RLIMIT\_STACK to the maximum size to eliminate the stack guard page, further simplifying exploitation.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability in `qsort()` stems from the function's implementation, which always recurses on the first sub-partition without regard to its size.  When provided with a carefully crafted input array, `qsort()` can recurse very deeply, consuming large amounts of stack space, which leads to a stack overflow.  On OpenBSD, the vulnerability can be exploited more easily because the stack guard page can be disabled by setting RLIMIT\_STACK to its maximum. The vulnerability is triggered when a local user can provide a pathological array to be sorted, causing the function to perform excessive recursions. This can lead to denial-of-service or combined with a stack clash exploit leading to local privilege escalation.

The provided code demonstrates an exploit where the `readdir` and `fstatat` functions are interposed to trick the `at` command to recursively call `qsort` with a pathological array, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and eventually control execution flow.

The provided content offers more details about the vulnerability and its exploitation than the official CVE description, including the specifics of how to trigger the issue in the vulnerable `qsort()` function and the mechanisms of stack clash exploitation.
