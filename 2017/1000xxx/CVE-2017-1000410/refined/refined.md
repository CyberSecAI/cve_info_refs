{
  "CVE-2017-1000410": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A stack information leak vulnerability was found in the EFS element of the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem. An attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of incoming L2CAP commands - ConfigRequest and ConfigResponse messages. Uninitialized stack variables are returned to an attacker in their uninitialized state.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Information Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the kernel. By manipulating code flows that precede the handling of these configuration messages, the attacker can gain some control over which data is held in the uninitialized stack variables, potentially bypassing KASLR and stack canaries protection.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker within Bluetooth range can exploit this vulnerability.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to communicate over Bluetooth is required."
    }
