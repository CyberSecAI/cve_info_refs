The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000189.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to pass options to the `ejs.render` function via a data object, including a `root` option that specifies the include directory. This could allow a malicious user to reset the include directory when using `render` with unsanitized parameters and potentially achieve remote code execution by including files from unexpected locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsanitized parameter passing to the `render` function.
- Ability to override the `root` option via the data object.
- Potential for remote code execution via crafted includes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could achieve remote code execution by manipulating the `root` directory and including arbitrary files within the rendering process, allowing them to execute code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Passing a crafted data object with a malicious `root` option to the `ejs.render` or `ejs.renderFile` function.
- Utilizing unsanitized or parameterized user input to influence the data passed to the rendering function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the data that is passed to the `ejs.render` or `ejs.renderFile` function.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application using EJS and be able to send malicious input.

The fix implemented in the commit is to blacklist the `cache`, `filename`, `root` and `localsName` options from being passed via the data object.
