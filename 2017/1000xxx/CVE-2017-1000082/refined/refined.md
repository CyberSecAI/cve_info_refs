The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1000082.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
systemd fails to correctly parse usernames that start with a digit. When systemd encounters such a username in a service configuration, it fails to switch to the specified user, and the service runs as root instead.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: systemd does not properly validate usernames, specifically those starting with a digit.
- Privilege escalation: Because the process runs as root instead of the intended user, this represents a privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: A service intended to run under a less privileged user account runs as root, giving the service full system privileges, potentially allowing for unauthorized actions.
- Security breach: Malicious code running within the service could gain full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious service configuration: An attacker can craft a service configuration with a username that starts with a digit, thus forcing the service to run as root.
- Compromise of existing service configurations: If an existing service is modified to specify a username starting with a digit, it would unintentionally escalate privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create/modify service configuration files that systemd uses.

The issue was discussed on GitHub and brought to the attention of the oss-security mailing list. The discussion on github includes example of the service file and the affected `systemd` version.
