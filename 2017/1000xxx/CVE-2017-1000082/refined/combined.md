## Description

[![@mapleray](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2456854?v=4&size=48)](/mapleray)[mapleray](https://github.com/mapleray)opened [on Jun 29, 2017](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6237#issue-239378060)
### Submission type

* Bug report

### systemd version the issue has been seen with

> systemd 232

### Used distribution

> Linux ubuntu 4.10.0-19-generic [#21](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/21)-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 6 17:04:57 UTC 2017 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

### In case of bug report: Expected behaviour you didn't see

> The process started by systemd should be user previlege

### In case of bug report: Unexpected behaviour you saw

> The process started by systemd was root previlege

### In case of bug report: Steps to reproduce the problem

linux user's name : `0day`

conf file: `socat.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=0day socat service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=0day
Restart=always
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/0day/
ExecStart=/usr/bin/socat TCP-LISTEN:18086,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"/opt/run-elf"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

and then use `systemctl start socat.service` to start process, but the previlege is root

P.S.

I searched google and found that it was not right to named a linux user with `0day`, it should satisfy `"^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*\$` , but when I use `xinted` to start the service, it can handle the previlege rightly with linux user `0day`

Subject: systemd fails to parse user that should run service

Hi all,

Just wanted to bring attention to issue with systemd not doing what is expected when parsing User that should run service.
When it fails to parse string starting with digit it fails back to root causing obvious threat to security.

See discussion with developer on github: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6237>

Best,
-Daniel Skowronski
