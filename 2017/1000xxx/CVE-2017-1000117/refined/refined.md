    "Weaknesses": [
      "Shell command injection",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running the Git client.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious repository clone",
      "Malicious commit within a legitimate repository",
      "Compromised proxy server delivering a crafted URL"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to clone a malicious repository or interact with a repository containing a malicious commit. An attacker could also control a proxy server to inject the malicious URL."
