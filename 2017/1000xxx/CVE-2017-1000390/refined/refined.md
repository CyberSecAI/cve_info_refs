- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing permission check in the Multijob plugin's Resume Build action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Multijob plugin did not verify if a user had the necessary permissions before allowing them to resume a build.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users with Job/Read permissions were able to resume builds, even if they should not have had the right to do so, leading to unauthorized build manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to have Job/Read permissions to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Job/Read permission within Jenkins to resume builds without proper authorization.
