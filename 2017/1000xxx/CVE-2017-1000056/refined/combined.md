# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@liggitt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980082?u=e6d3a90de563c894207290d21eb6987a1d45391a&v=4&size=48)](/liggitt)[liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)opened [on Mar 21, 2017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43459#issue-215777119)

A PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin vulnerability allows users to make use of any PodSecurityPolicy object, even ones they are not authorized to use.

CVE: [CVE-2017-1000056](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jx2-76rc-2v7v "CVE-2017-1000056")

* Fixed in [v1.5.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.5.5) in [7fef0a4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/7fef0a4f6a44ea36f166c39fdade5324eff2dd5e)
* Fixed in release-1.5 branch in [Automated cherry pick of #43489 #43491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43491)
* Fixed in master in [Authorize PSP usage for pods without service accounts #43489](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43489)

**Who is affected?**

Only Kubernetes 1.5.0-1.5.4 installations that do *all* of the following:

* Enable the PodSecurityPolicy API (which is not enabled by default):

  `--runtime-config=extensions/v1beta1/podsecuritypolicy=true`
* Enable the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin (which is not enabled by default):

  `--admission-control=...,PodSecurityPolicy,...`
* Use authorization to limit users' ability to use specific PodSecurityPolicy objects

kubeadm and GKE do not allow enabling PodSecurityPolicy in 1.5, so are not affected by this vulnerability.

kube-up.sh and kops do not enable PodSecurityPolicy by default, so are not affected by this vulnerability. A modified kube-up.sh or kops deployment could have enabled it.

**What is the impact?**

A user that is authorized to create pods can make use of any existing PodSecurityPolicy, even ones they are not authorized to use.

**How can I mitigate this prior to installing 1.5.5?**

1. Export existing PodSecurityPolicy objects:

   `kubectl get podsecuritypolicies -o yaml > psp.yaml`
2. Review and delete any PodSecurityPolicy objects you do not want all pod-creating users to be able to use (NOTE: Privileged users that were making use of those policies will also lose access to those policies). For example:

   `kubectl delete podsecuritypolicies/my-privileged-policy`
3. After upgrading to 1.5.5, re-create the exported PodSecurityPolicy objects:

   `kubectl create -f psp.yaml`
