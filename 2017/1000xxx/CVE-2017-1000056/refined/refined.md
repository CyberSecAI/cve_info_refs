Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin within Kubernetes versions 1.5.0-1.5.4. The plugin incorrectly authorized pod creation requests, specifically when no user information was present, such as requests hitting the unsecure port. It authorized access to *any* existing PodSecurityPolicy, even ones the user wasn't explicitly authorized to use.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The core issue is a flaw in how the `authorizedForPolicy` function evaluated user permissions for PodSecurityPolicies. When user info was missing or nil, the function defaulted to allowing access instead of properly checking authorization.
- **Missing Access Control Check:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin was not properly verifying if the user or service account had permissions to use the PodSecurityPolicy before applying it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who is authorized to create pods, but not authorized to use certain PodSecurityPolicies, could effectively bypass the intended restrictions. They could use any existing PodSecurityPolicy, potentially gaining access to elevated privileges and resources beyond what was intended.
- **Unauthorized Resource Access:** By using an arbitrary PodSecurityPolicy, an attacker could potentially create pods that have access to sensitive data or perform actions that should not be permitted under normal circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Kubernetes API to create pods.
- **Bypassing Authentication:** If the vulnerability is used in a way where a request comes through the unsecured port, then the authorization check fails.
- **Pod Creation:** The attacker would need the ability to create pods, which is often a basic permission for developers within a cluster.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create pods in a Kubernetes cluster.
- The cluster must have the PodSecurityPolicy API enabled (`--runtime-config=extensions/v1beta1/podsecuritypolicy=true`) and the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin enabled (`--admission-control=...,PodSecurityPolicy,...`).
- The cluster must be using authorization to limit users' ability to use specific PodSecurityPolicy objects.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Kubernetes version 1.5.5 and later.
- The provided content includes a description of the mitigation strategy that could be used prior to upgrading to 1.5.5, which involves exporting, deleting, and recreating PodSecurityPolicies.
- The fix is implemented in the commit [7fef0a4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/7fef0a4f6a44ea36f166c39fdade5324eff2dd5e).
-  The code changes in the fix involves updating the `authorizedForPolicy` function to properly check authorization even when user info is absent.
- The Github issue [43459](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43459) details the specifics of this vulnerability and provides context for the resolution.
- The pull request that addressed the fix is [43489](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43489), which was later cherry-picked into the 1.5 branch in pull request [43491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43491).
- The CVE is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.

In summary, CVE-2017-1000056 is a critical vulnerability in Kubernetes' PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin that could allow an attacker to escalate privileges by circumventing intended authorization controls on PodSecurityPolicies.
