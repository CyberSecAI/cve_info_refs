Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-1000476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how ImageMagick processes malformed DirectDraw Surface (DDS) image files, specifically in the `SkipDXTMipmaps` function.
*   The `mipmapcount` value within a crafted DDS file can be set to an extremely large number. This causes a loop in the `SkipDXTMipmaps` function to perform a large number of `SeekBlob` operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The primary issue is the excessive CPU consumption caused by the large number of seek operations within a loop.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `mipmapcount` value, which dictates the loop's iterations, is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to specify a very large value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to significant CPU exhaustion, rendering the ImageMagick application unresponsive or slow. This effectively denies service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker crafts a malicious DDS image file with an excessively large `mipmapcount` value.
*   **Image Processing:** The crafted image file is then processed by ImageMagick, either through direct user interaction or via an automated system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting a Malicious Image:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malformed DDS file with a large `mipmapcount` value.
*   **Access to Image Processing System:** The attacker needs to be able to have the malicious file processed by a vulnerable ImageMagick instance. This could be through direct upload, email attachments, or via other means.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided backtrace shows that the `SeekBlob` function is being called repeatedly, and that `dds_info->mipmapcount` is set to a very large value like `4289331201`.
*   The vulnerability affects several versions of ImageMagick across various Linux distributions.
*   The issue is fixed in updated versions of the `imagemagick` package as indicated by the Debian and Ubuntu security notices.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted file to the `convert` command, as shown in the example `convert SeekBlob-cpu-exhaustion /dev/null`.
