- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe Java deserialization. The Akka remoting uses Java serializer as default which allows an attacker to provide arbitrary types, leading to remote code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Use of Java serialization without proper validation.
    - Default configuration enabling Java serialization.
    - Incomplete documentation on disabling Java serializer.
    - Missing documentation on enabling mutual authentication.
    - Vulnerable when TLS is disabled, or TLS is enabled without mutual authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution on the JVM process running the Akka ActorSystem.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker that can connect to an ActorSystem exposed via Akka Remote over TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to connect to an exposed Akka ActorSystem via TCP.
    - If TLS is enabled with mutual authentication, the attacker needs a valid certificate (e.g., by compromising a node with a certificate issued by the same internal PKI)
