Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Mautic handles user authentication when a third-party Single Sign-On (SSO) plugin is used. Specifically, disabled users could still log in if their email address matched an existing user, even if that user's account was explicitly disabled within Mautic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is a failure to properly enforce the disabled user status during SSO authentication. The system only checked if the email address existed instead of also checking for the "disabled" flag of the user.
- **Bypass of intended security mechanism:** The SSO authentication bypasses the intended user status check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** A disabled user could gain unauthorized access to the Mautic platform.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Once logged in, the disabled user could potentially perform actions they are not authorized to do which can lead to further compromise, depending on the userâ€™s previous access level.
- **Compromise of Data:**  If the disabled user had access to sensitive data, this data can be viewed or altered.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack is conducted over the network through the application's login interface.
- **Third-Party SSO Plugin:** This vulnerability is only exploitable when Mautic is configured to use a third-party SSO plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Existing Mautic User:** The attacker must be an existing Mautic user, although their account is disabled.
- **Valid Credentials (via SSO):** The attacker needs a valid account at the 3rd party SSO provider.
- **Email address match:** The email address used by the disabled user in the SSO provider must match an existing disabled user in Mautic.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Mautic versions 2.0.0 to 2.11.0.
- It was fixed in version 2.12.0.
- The CVSS v3 score is 8.1 (High) with a base vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating the high potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability if exploited.
- An EPSS score of 0.213% suggests a relatively low probability of exploitation within the next 30 days.
