Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue present in the administration console of Oracle GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.1. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing file paths, allowing an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core issue is a path traversal vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided file paths, allowing the attacker to use directory traversal sequences (like `../`) to access files outside the webroot.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate or sanitize the file path provided in the GET request. Specifically, the application fails to normalize URL-encoded directory traversal characters (`%c0%af`) which when decoded turn into `..`.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive File Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially gaining access to configuration files, source code, credentials, and other sensitive information. This is demonstrated by the ability to read `win.ini` on Windows and `etc/shadow` on Linux.
- **Information Leakage:** The disclosed information can be used for further attacks or reconnaissance.
- **Compromise of System:** Access to sensitive files can potentially lead to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/theme/META-INF/prototype` endpoint, including a path traversal sequence with the file to be read. This was also shown to work against `/theme/META-INF/json`, `/theme/META-INF/dojo`, and `/theme/com/sun`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Oracle GlassFish Server, typically over port 4848.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send custom HTTP GET requests containing the path traversal sequence in the URI.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Oracle GlassFish Server Open Source Edition version 4.1 and prior.
- The exploit uses URL encoded characters (`%c0%af` which becomes `..` when decoded) as a bypass.
- The Metasploit modules provided provide automated exploitation of this issue.
- The provided advisory mentions a "simple bypass" suggesting that normal url encoding of `..` was blocked, this was bypassed using an overlong UTF8 encoding, which will still decode to `..` on the server but might bypass some protections.
