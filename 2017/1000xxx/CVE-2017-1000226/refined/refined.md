Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check in the "Stop User Enumeration" WordPress plugin for blocking user enumeration via the REST API. The plugin attempts to block requests to `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` by checking if the string “users” is present in the `REQUEST_URI`. However, the check only considers the `REQUEST_URI`, ignoring the possibility of a request type being simulated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin fails to account for the WordPress REST API's ability to simulate different request types. It only checks the `REQUEST_URI` for the presence of "users" string and doesn't consider the actual request method.
- **Bypass of Intended Protection:** Attackers can bypass the intended blocking mechanism by sending a POST request with the "users" string within the request body and using the `_method=GET` parameter to force the REST API to process the request as a GET request, thus exposing user data.
- **Regex Misuse:** The use of `preg_match('/users/', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])` while seemingly functional on the surface, was not comprehensive enough to block all enumeration vectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** Attackers can successfully enumerate user login names by querying the REST API, which the plugin is designed to prevent.
- **Precursor to Further Attacks:**  User enumeration is often a preliminary step for brute-force password attacks and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a POST request containing `rest_route=/wp/v2/users` in the body, along with the `_method=GET` parameter in the query.
- **Direct REST API Access:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to user data through the WordPress REST API endpoint, which should be protected by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require any prior authentication to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in version 1.3.8 of the plugin and was fixed in version 1.3.9.
- The dxw advisory provided a clear proof of concept using a `curl` command.
- The plugin's intended functionality was to block user enumeration attempts, but this specific vulnerability bypassed the intended protection.
- The advisory provides a detailed timeline of the vulnerability discovery, reporting, and fix.
