Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the XStream library handles the deserialization of XML data. Specifically, it attempts to create an instance of the `void` or `Void` type when instructed to do so via specially crafted XML. This action leads to a crash of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) because `void` is not an instantiable type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** XStream does not adequately validate or sanitize the type information within XML input, allowing an attacker to specify the non-instantiable `void` type for deserialization.
- **Deserialization Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is triggered when XStream attempts to deserialize the crafted XML input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Successful exploitation results in a crash of the Java process running Jenkins, leading to a denial of service. The Jenkins instance becomes unavailable until the service is restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XML Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious XML payloads containing the `void` type information into Jenkins. The attack surface is where XStream is used to process XML.
- **Manipulated Input Stream:**  Attackers need the ability to manipulate data that is processed by XStream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Jenkins Configuration:** An attacker needs the ability to provide malicious XML to Jenkins via configuration of items (jobs), views, or agents in Jenkins.
- **Authenticated User:** Typically, this would require a user with permissions to create or configure items (jobs), views, or agents in Jenkins.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is in the XStream library, not directly in Jenkins code, but Jenkins is affected due to its use of XStream.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting XML containing `<void/>` or equivalent JSON like `{'void':null}`. It can also be triggered by adding a `class='void'` attribute to other XML elements.
- The provided text also includes workarounds that can be applied to fix the issue.
- Jenkins now prohibits the attempted deserialization of `void`/`Void` to prevent the crash.
