### @meaksh **[meaksh](/meaksh)** commented [Apr 26, 2018](#issue-317997247)

This PR fixes [CVE-2017-1000469](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-96hw-v598-jvgh "CVE-2017-1000469") by escaping the parameters that are coming from the user (like repo, mirror, etc) and used for building the shell command string which is executed on the `cobbler reposync` action. That way, we prevent from executing the malicious shell code that might be injected in variables set by the user.

Fixes [#1845](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/1845)

What do you think about this fix?

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Description

[![@0xabe-io](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5858593?u=e1f470d130ffd1df14aea69f0f798f0c626135d7&v=4&size=48)](/0xabe-io)[0xabe-io](https://github.com/0xabe-io)opened [on Oct 19, 2017](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/1845#issue-266756702)

In the `Repos` feature, Cobbler does not sanitize its user input; as a result, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands by specifying a malformed repository mirror during its creation or edition. As the service runs as root, it is thus possible to leak sensitive information and gain remote root access on the machine that runs Cobbler.

Sample of a malicious input, entered in the `Mirror` field in the `Adding a Repo` form:

```
/etc/passwd;id & echo /

```

Then a `Reposync` action has to be executed to trigger the malicious command to run. Its output can be seen in the log of the action, which is in the `Events` page.

To fix this issue, we would suggest to filter the user input to remove none valid path characters. Additionally, it would be advisable to run rsync command, if not the entire service, as an unprivileged user.

This issue has been verified on versions up to 2.8.2.
