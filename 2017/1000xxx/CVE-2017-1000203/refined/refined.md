{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `RootdExpandPathName` function in ROOT used `popen()` to expand path names, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input path contains shell meta-characters. Specifically, the input was not properly sanitized before being passed to the shell.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection: The use of `popen()` with unsanitized input allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server where the ROOT application is running, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could provide a malicious path name string containing shell meta-characters that, when processed by the `RootdExpandPathName` function using `popen()`, would be executed by the underlying operating system's shell.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `RootdExpandPathName` function. This could be through a network request or other interaction with the server running the vulnerable ROOT application. The attacker does not need any special privileges beyond the ability to send data to the server.",
   "Additional Details": "The fix replaces the use of `popen()` with a more secure method of path expansion that avoids using the shell. The code now emulates csh functionality for tilde expansion and handles environment variables. The commit also introduces the `EscChar` function which escapes shell meta-characters to prevent command injection during shell expansion using `popen`. The previous implementation using `popen()` was vulnerable because it did not sanitize user-supplied path names, allowing for the injection of malicious shell commands. The new implementation directly manipulates the string, expanding the path name."
