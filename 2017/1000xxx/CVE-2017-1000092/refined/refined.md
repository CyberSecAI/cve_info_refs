The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000092.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Git Plugin connects to a user-specified Git repository during form validation. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The plugin does not require POST requests for form validation, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious link.
- Insufficient permission checks: The plugin doesn't validate the user's permission before connecting to a Git repository, allowing an attacker to trigger credential exposure even without direct access to Jenkins.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a user with job configuration permissions into following a malicious link.
- This leads the Jenkins Git client to send the user's username and password to an attacker-controlled server.
- This results in the attacker capturing the user's Git credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker creates a maliciously crafted Jenkins URL.
- The attacker tricks a user with job configuration permissions into clicking the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No direct access to Jenkins is required
- Ability to guess a username/password credential ID.
- Ability to craft a malicious Jenkins URL.
- Ability to trick a user with job configuration permissions into clicking the malicious URL.
