Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000401:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Jenkins default form control for passwords and other secrets, `<f:password/>`, used GET requests for form validation. This could result in secrets being logged to HTTP access logs in non-default configurations of Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure Transmission of Secrets:** Sending form validation requests via GET exposed sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys, in the URL. This data could be unintentionally logged and potentially accessed by unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Secrets:**  An attacker who gains access to HTTP access logs could potentially recover passwords, API keys, and other sensitive data submitted through `<f:password/>` form controls.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Access to HTTP Access Logs:** An attacker would need access to the web server's HTTP access logs to retrieve the exposed secrets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to Logs:** The attacker needs to have access to the server's HTTP access logs where the GET requests with the sensitive information are logged.
- **Non-default logging configuration:** This attack is reliant on a non-default logging configuration that would log the requests.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability is a low severity issue. However, it exposes a weakness in the way that Jenkins handled form validation for password fields. By using GET requests, the password/secrets would be logged in server logs.
