Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `file` utility due to improper handling of the .notes section in ELF binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `do_bid_note` function within `src/readelf.c`. The code reads the `descsz` (description size) field from the ELF .notes section and uses it to copy data into a fixed-size stack buffer called `desc` of 20 bytes. A vulnerability exists because the size check `(descsz >= 4 || descsz <= 20)` allows `descsz` to have value greater than 20 which leads to a buffer overflow when copying `descsz` number of bytes into the 20 bytes buffer `desc` using `memcpy(desc, &nbuf[doff], descsz)`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution or cause a denial of service (DoS) by crafting a malicious ELF binary with a specially crafted .notes section.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the `file` utility processes a malicious ELF binary with a crafted `.notes` section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ELF file to the vulnerable `file` utility.  This could be achieved through various means, such as tricking a user into analyzing the malicious file.  The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system other than to be able to supply a malicious ELF file and have the file utility analyze it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `9611f31313a93aa036389c5f3b15eea53510d4d1` and fixed in commit `35c94dc6acc418f1ad7f6241a6680e5327495793`.
- The vulnerable code is located in `src/readelf.c`
- The fix involved changing the condition to `(descsz >= 4 && descsz <= 20)` which prevents buffer overflows when the value of `descsz` is greater than 20.
- Debian assigned DSA-3965-1 to address this issue.
