- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple "expired" flows, resulting from flows with "idle-timeout" and "hard-timeout" sent to the OpenFlow Plugin REST API, are not properly removed from the CONFIG DATASTORE, leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Failure to remove expired flow entries from the CONFIG DATASTORE.
    - Lack of resource management for expired flows.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Controller shutdown due to memory exhaustion.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attack against the OpenDayLight Controller.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Northbound attack: Sending multiple flows with timeouts via the OpenFlow Plugin REST API.
    - Southbound attack: Flow flooding attack by an attacker, where the flows have timeouts, leading to an overflow of the controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to send flow requests to the OpenFlow Plugin REST API.
    - Network access to the OpenDayLight controller.
