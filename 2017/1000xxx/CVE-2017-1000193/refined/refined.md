The provided content is a comparison between two versions of the OctoberCMS repository (v1.0.412 and v1.0.413). The commit messages indicate multiple security fixes were implemented. Here's a breakdown of the relevant changes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Media Manager was using a blacklist approach to blocking files, which was deemed too fragile.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate file upload filtering/validation using a blacklist approach in the Media Manager.
- Potential for unauthorized file uploads leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Lack of proper error handling in Asset List and Media Manager.
- Insufficient access control for the Media Manager, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution from malicious file uploads
- Displaying error information without user friendly alerts.
- Unauthorized access to media manager.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a file with an extension not blacklisted by the Media Manager.
- Accessing the Media Manager without proper access privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload files through the Media Manager.
- May require an authenticated user with some level of access but not necessarily full admin access.

**Summary of Fixes:**
- The Media Manager now uses a whitelist approach for allowed file types instead of a blacklist.
- Asset List and Media Manager now use `$.oc.alert` when displaying errors for more user friendly alerts.
- The Media Manager is blocked entirely if the user lacks the required access permissions.
