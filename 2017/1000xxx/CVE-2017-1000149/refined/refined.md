Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `target="_blank"` in HTML links and the `window.open()` JavaScript function, which, by default, provides the newly opened window/tab with access to the original window's `window.opener` object. This access allows the new window to control the navigation of the original window and potentially access its DOM, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This is an issue even if the new window is on a different domain, and the `window.opener` object persists even if the user navigates away from the original page in either window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **`target="_blank"` and `window.open()`:** These mechanisms, when used without proper precautions, expose the `window.opener` object, which can be manipulated by the newly opened window.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability for a new window to control the original window via `window.opener` creates an opportunity for XSS attacks, potentially allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the context of the original window.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application did not initially sanitize user-generated links, allowing users to specify `target="_blank"` attribute.
*   **Insecure use of pop-up windows:** The application made use of pop-up windows for some administrative configurations, which were opened with `target="_blank"` or `window.open()`, exposing them to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Navigation Control:** An attacker can redirect the original window to a malicious website or a phishing page, potentially tricking users into providing sensitive information.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially manipulate the content and behavior of the original window through DOM access via the `window.opener` object.
*   **XSS Attacks:** Execution of arbitrary javascript in the context of the original page, leading to a wide range of attacks like session hijacking and data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Generated Links:** Malicious users can insert links with `target="_blank"` attributes, especially through content editors like TinyMCE if the target option is not disabled.
*   **Malicious external websites:** If the application has hard-coded links to malicious external websites, these can exploit the vulnerability using `target="_blank"`
*   **Pop-up windows:** Malicious websites or scripts loaded in pop-up windows can exploit the `window.opener` object to affect the original window.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject HTML:** The attacker must be able to inject HTML, either by using the content editor functionality or by controlling a page linked from the vulnerable application.
*   **Access to the victim's browser:** The attacker's malicious script needs to be loaded in a new window/tab opened by the victim's browser from the vulnerable application.
*   **(For user-generated links):** Attacker needs to have user level access to create content.

**Mitigation Efforts (from the content):**

*   **Disable "Target" Option:** Disabling the target option in the TinyMCE editor for user-generated content.
*   **HTMLPurifier:** Using HTMLPurifier to remove the `target` attributes in user-generated links.
*   **Code review:** Checking the codebase for hard-coded links with `target="_blank"` attributes or `window.open()` calls.
*   **Force same window:** Changing `target="_blank"` to `target="_self`" or removing the target attribute altogether.
*  **Use of iframes/modal:** For internal links, the content is to be displayed in iframes or modals instead of opening in a new window.
*   **No more pop-up windows:** The application removes the use of mandatory pop-up windows.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report mentions that `rel="noreferrer"` was considered but was not a suitable solution due to lack of support in Internet Explorer.
*   The fix involved multiple patches, and some complex cases required more consideration for a proper mitigation strategy.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the `target="_blank"` attribute where possible and by changing the usage of pop-ups to iframes/modals.
