# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[v1.0.1](/Betterment/test_track/tree/v1.0.1)

[`e9cc2df`](/Betterment/test_track/commit/e9cc2df4e4e3b9a5b1f0ef4bc3327c487679a407)

There was a bug in the authentication code that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to mark a running split as complete, breaking clients in the field that depended on the split.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE identifier [CVE-2017-1000068](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f3vq-f835-m47x "CVE-2017-1000068").

Affected versions:

All versions of TestTrack less than 1.0.1

Impact:

[AuthenticatedApiController](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track/blob/v1.0/app/controllers/authenticated_api_controller.rb#L8), the base class of all authenticated endpoints, was making incorrect use of `authenticate_with_http_basic`. `authenticate_with_http_basic` does not evaluate the provided block if there is no basic auth header in the request, allowing request processing to proceed if no creds at all were provided.

The impact was mitigated by the fact that most authenticated endpoints require current\_app in order to fulfill their functions. The exception was the [SplitConfigsController](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track/blob/v1.0/app/controllers/api/v1/split_configs_controller.rb#L11-L15), which would deactivate any split provided by an unauthenticated client.

[The fix](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track/commit/e9cc2df4e4e3b9a5b1f0ef4bc3327c487679a407) was two-fold:

* [Disallow finishing splits](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track/blob/e9cc2df4e4e3b9a5b1f0ef4bc3327c487679a407/app/controllers/api/v1/split_configs_controller.rb#L12) not owned by current\_app
* [use `authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic`](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track/blob/e9cc2df4e4e3b9a5b1f0ef4bc3327c487679a407/app/controllers/authenticated_api_controller.rb#L8), which will halt the filter chain and return 401 if no HTTP basic auth credentials are provided.

Releases:

The fixed version - v1.0.1 - is available via github.
