The provided content describes three distinct memory safety issues in the `exiv2` library, a parser for image metadata. While the content is not a formal CVE description, it provides more technical detail.

**1. Heap Overflow (Write) in TIFF Parser:**

*   **Root Cause:** A malformed TIFF file triggers a one-byte heap overflow during the parsing process.
*   **Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
*  **Weakness:** Incorrect buffer size calculation/validation when processing TIFF metadata.
*   **Impact:** A one-byte heap overflow that could lead to application crash or potentially code execution by overwriting heap metadata, depending on the memory layout.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted, malformed TIFF image file to `exiv2`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious TIFF image to `exiv2`.

**2. Heap Out-of-Bounds Read in JP2/JPEG2000 Parser:**

*   **Root Cause:** A malformed JPEG2000 file leads to a large out-of-bounds heap read.
*   **Vulnerability:** Heap-based out-of-bounds read.
*   **Weakness**: Incorrect handling of image data size, leading to reading beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:**  A large out-of-bounds read that could leak sensitive information from memory or crash the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted, malformed JPEG2000 image file to `exiv2`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG2000 image to `exiv2`.

**3. Stack Out-of-Bounds Read in WebP Parser:**

*   **Root Cause:** A malformed WebP file triggers a six-byte out-of-bounds stack read.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stack-based out-of-bounds read.
*  **Weakness:** When decoding chunks in WebP files, incorrect boundary checks cause the program to read data past the allocated stack buffer.
*  **Impact:** A six-byte stack out-of-bounds read that could result in application crash, or potential information disclosure by reading adjacent data on the stack.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted, malformed WebP image file to `exiv2`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious WebP image to `exiv2`.

In summary, the `exiv2` library suffers from multiple memory safety issues, triggered by malformed image files. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, can result in crashes, denial of service, information disclosure, and possibly code execution. The identified vulnerabilities affect TIFF, JPEG2000, and WebP parsing.
