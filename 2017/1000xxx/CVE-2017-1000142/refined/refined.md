The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1000142.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because users could delete submitted pages by directly accessing the `delete.php` script with the page ID as a parameter, even though there was no "Delete" button present for the page in the UI. This indicates a lack of proper authorization checks within the `delete.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the application allowed a user to directly manipulate the "id" parameter in the URL to delete a page, without proper authorization checks to verify if the user has permission to delete that specific page.
- **Missing Access Control:** The application did not properly verify if the user has the right to delete a page, based on the page's submission status. This means that a user who submitted a page can also delete it through the direct URL access even though the UI prevents it, indicating an inconsistency between UI and backend logic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized deletion of submitted pages: An attacker can delete submitted pages if they know the page ID, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of workflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct URL manipulation: The attacker needs to know the page ID of the page they want to delete and then craft a URL with the `delete.php?id=XXX` endpoint to delete the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user with the ability to submit pages.
- The attacker must be able to determine or guess the page ID.
