The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins, including CVE-2017-1000362 (SECURITY-376):

**CVE-2017-1000362 (SECURITY-376):**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The re-key admin monitor, introduced in Jenkins 1.498, re-encrypted all secrets with a new key. During this process, it created a backup directory containing all old secrets and the key used to encrypt them, which were world-readable and not removed afterwards.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** World-readable backup directory containing old secrets and the key used to encrypt them.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of old secrets and encryption keys. Attackers with access to the file system could potentially decrypt sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local file system access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires local access to the Jenkins server's file system.

The vulnerability was fixed by deleting the backup directory and preventing its creation in future upgrades from versions before 1.498. Administrators are advised to check for and delete the backup directory `$JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups`.
