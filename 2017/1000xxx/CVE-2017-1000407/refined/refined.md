{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The KVM implementation for Intel processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of operations within a virtualized environment",
       "Insufficient validation of I/O port access"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest VM can cause a denial of service (crash) of the host by flooding the I/O port 0x80 with write requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation occurs through the KVM hypervisor from within a guest virtual machine.",
       "Specifically, by writing to host I/O port 0x80 from the guest VM"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "An attacker requires the ability to execute code within a guest virtual machine that uses the KVM hypervisor.",
     "Capability to write to port 0x80 is required."
    ]
