- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not invalidate existing user sessions after a user changes their password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate session management. Specifically, the application fails to invalidate existing user sessions after a password change.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If an attacker has compromised a user's account and the user changes their password, the attacker can still use the old session to access the account, rendering the password change ineffective.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the user login and password change functionality. The attacker must first compromise the account to benefit from the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have already gained access to a user's session before the password change.
