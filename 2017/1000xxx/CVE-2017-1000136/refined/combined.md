### Bug Description

Hi Security Team,

I have discovered the session management issue on the domain <https://mahara.org/>

Description of the issue-

The application does not invalidate the previous session once the password is changed by the legitimate user.

How to reproduce?-

1. Login in the application using <https://mahara.org/> and login into the application.

2. Lets assume application user's account is compromised so he wants to change his password, he will navigate to forgot password page and will change his password.

3. Application user is able to change his password but it was observed that still the previous session was not invalidated and i was actually able to browse the application from both the sessions.

Impact- If the application user's account is compromised, he will simply change his password but if the previous session is not invalidated there is no use of changing the password.

Please let me know if you need video PoC for this.

Remediation- Invalidate the previous session once the password has been changed and enforce the application user to relogin in the application.

Thanks and Regards,

Abhishek Dashora

Hi Abhishek,

There is nothing to do for you. The CVE has been published as we released a fix for the bug already. Please see <https://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=7166>

It was just now that we received the CVE assignment and I updated the bug report with the reference.

Cheers

Kristina
