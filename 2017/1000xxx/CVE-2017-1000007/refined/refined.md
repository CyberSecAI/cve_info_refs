The content is related to CVE-2017-1000007.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `AWSServiceEndpoint` in `txaws` defaults to not verifying server certificates when making HTTPS requests. This means it will silently allow communication with a TLS server using self-signed, expired or hostname mismatch certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing TLS certificate validation: The code does not enforce verification of the server's TLS certificate.
- Acceptance of self-signed, expired and hostname mismatch certificates

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: An attacker could intercept and modify communications between the `txaws` client and the server by using a malicious certificate. This could lead to data compromise, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Data compromise: Sensitive data being sent through the connection could be exposed to an attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks by setting up a rogue server using a malicious certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the `txaws` client and the server. This can be achieved by:
    - being on the same network
    - controlling a router or network device between the client and the server
    - using techniques like ARP poisoning to redirect traffic
- The attacker needs to have a valid malicious certificate.
