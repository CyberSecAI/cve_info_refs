### Summary of CVE-2017-1000083

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the way `evince` handles Comic Book Tar (CBT) files. When opening a CBT file, `evince` uses the `tar` command to extract images within the archive. The filename of a page within the archive is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to insert `tar` command-line options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw.  The `tar` command is invoked with an attacker-controlled filename, which can start with `--`, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
-   **Insecure Usage of `tar`:** The application passes attacker-controlled data to `tar` without proper sanitization or safeguards.
-   **Vulnerable Thumbnailer:**  The `evince` thumbnailer, which is not sandboxed, can trigger the vulnerability, especially if web browsers allow automatic downloading of files which triggers the thumbnailer. This makes it easily exploitable.
-   **Limited Input Length**: The payload size is limited to 256 bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running `evince`.
-  **System Compromise:** By exploiting the arbitrary code execution, the attacker can compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious CBT file:** An attacker creates a specially crafted CBT file that includes a malicious filename (starting with `--` and followed by a command).
-   **User Interaction:**  The user needs to open the crafted `.cbt` file with a vulnerable version of `evince`.
-  **Automatic Exploitation (via thumbnailer):** Some file managers may trigger automatic exploitation via thumbnailer preview functionality which bypasses manual file opening.
- **Web Browsers:** Web browsers that automatically download files can trigger the thumbnailer, making it web-exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to create a malicious CBT file.**
-   **Ability to convince a user to open the file or trick a browser/file manager to process it.**

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Felix Wilhelm from the Google Security Team.
*   The issue was fixed by removing support for tar and tar-like commands in the evince backend, instead of trying to sanitize the arguments.
*   Red Hat assigned CVE-2017-1000083 to this vulnerability and released a security advisory (RHSA-2017:2388).
*   Debian assigned DSA-3911-1 and DLA-1031-1.
*   The issue has been addressed in the gnome-3-20, gnome-3-22, and gnome-3-24 branches, for distributions to cherry pick, or backport to older versions.
*   A Metasploit module was created to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists in the upstream evince since: commit d68a91467efab8ef8a8f98589dd4c21b993b6e14.
