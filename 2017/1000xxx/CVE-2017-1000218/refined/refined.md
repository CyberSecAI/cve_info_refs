- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `writelogentry` function of LightFTP v1.1. This is caused by the use of `strcat` without proper bounds checking when constructing log messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The `strcat` function is used to append user-controlled data to a fixed-size buffer (`_text`) without any length validation which allows an attacker to write past the end of the buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this buffer overflow could lead to remote code execution, or denial of service. The provided crash demonstrates that the program crashes and return address can be overwritten.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted FTP command sequence (USER, PASS, followed by a long string) to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server on port 9999, and send the malicious payload to trigger the overflow, this is a network-based attack that does not require prior authentication.
