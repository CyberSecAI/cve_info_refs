Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a double-free vulnerability in the Gravity programming language interpreter. The issue occurs during the process of freeing memory associated with a class object. Specifically, it appears a string duplicated using `string_dup` was freed twice due to an error in object lifecycle management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free. This occurs when the same memory location is deallocated (freed) twice, which leads to memory corruption, program crashes, and can be leveraged by attackers for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Program Crash:** The immediate impact is a program crash due to the double-free.
- **Memory Corruption:** Double frees can corrupt the heap metadata, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control over memory allocation.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the memory corruption could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution given an attacker could manipulate the heap.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is providing a specially crafted input program to the Gravity interpreter, that triggers the flawed object freeing routine.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to create a simple program that will trigger the double free in the Gravity Interpreter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code with a vulnerable version of the Gravity interpreter.
- They need to be able to supply a crafted input that will trigger the double free, as demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The ASAN output provides a detailed stack trace of the double-free. The double free occurs when the interpreter attempts to free an object at `0x60200000e250`.
- The stack traces shows the flow of code execution where the free occurred: `__interceptor_free`, `gravity_class_free_internal`, `gravity_class_free_core`, `gravity_core_free` and `main`.
- The ASAN output states the memory was previously allocated using `__interceptor_calloc` in the `string_dup` function.
- The provided PoC shows how to trigger the vulnerability by instantiating an object, calling a function on it, binding a function to `Int`, then program exit.

This vulnerability appears to be a classic use-after-free/double-free issue. The fix would likely involve ensuring the interpreter has proper reference counting of the string duplicate, and associated objects, to prevent double deallocations.
