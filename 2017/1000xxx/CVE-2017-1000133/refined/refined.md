Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the Mahara application's failure to properly check user permissions before exporting artifacts (files, images) embedded in pages via the HTML export functionality. Specifically, when a page contains artifacts belonging to other users, the export process was not verifying if the exporting user had the necessary permissions to view those artifacts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control checks during the HTML export process. The system failed to verify whether a user was authorized to view or access the artifacts they were exporting when those artifacts were not owned by them.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to artifacts. By exporting a page containing embedded content owned by other users, an attacker could potentially gain access to files that they were not meant to view, downloading a 1024x1024 'thumbnail' of any user's arbitrary file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Files:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive files and images belonging to other users without proper authorization.
- **Information Leakage:** This could lead to the leakage of confidential data and personal information stored within the exported artifacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTML Export Functionality:** The attack vector is through the HTML export function of Mahara.
- **Embedded Artifacts:** The vulnerability is triggered when a page contains embedded artifacts (e.g., images) that belong to other users.
- **Image Resize Functionality:** The size of the image accessed is limited to the maximum thumbnail size configured for embedded images (e.g., 1024x1024).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid Mahara Account:** The attacker needs a valid account on the Mahara platform.
- **Ability to Create Pages:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit pages.
- **Knowledge of Embedded Artifacts:** The attacker needs to embed or access pages containing embedded artifacts from other users.
- **Use the HTML export function:** The attacker needs to export the page via the HTML export option to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was initially identified in earlier versions of Mahara and later fixed in versions 15.04.8, 15.10.4, 16.04.2, and 16.10.0.
- The fix involved adding checks to the export process using `$USER->can_view_artefact()` to ensure that users only exported the files they were authorized to access.
- The initial attempt to use this function was deemed too resource-intensive so a fix was made to only check access on files not owned by the user as this would be a smaller number of files.
- The original report mentions an issue of embedding other user's artifacts in user's pages that was fixed previously which was a mitigation for the vulnerability, with this issue being spun off into a new bug.
- The issue only affected HTML exports when blocks have attached artifacts not owned by the user.
