This content is related to the provided CVE ID, specifically mentioning "a proof-of-concept for CVE-2017-1000374 and CVE-2017-1000375 in NetBSD's stack guard-page implementation".

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- **CVE-2017-1000374:** The NetBSD kernel has a vulnerability in its stack guard-page implementation. Specifically, if a local attacker sets the `RLIMIT_STACK` to its maximum value (`MAXSSIZ`), it eliminates the `PROT_NONE` part of the stack region, effectively disabling the stack guard page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Stack Guard Page Implementation:** The vulnerability stems from how the kernel handles stack limits, specifically when the maximum stack size is requested, the protection normally afforded by the guard page is disabled.
- **Lack of Enforcement:** The kernel does not properly enforce the stack guard page when the maximum stack size is requested.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By eliminating the stack guard page, an attacker can potentially overwrite other memory regions, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this to gain elevated privileges by running a carefully crafted program.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system, as the attacker needs to be able to set the RLIMIT_STACK.
- **Exploitation Steps:** The attack would involve:
    1. Setting `RLIMIT_STACK` to `MAXSSIZ` to eliminate the stack guard-page
    2. Consuming large amounts of stack memory, possibly through recursive function calls, until the stack pointer moves into a target memory region.
    3. Overwriting data within that target memory region, possibly including function pointers to gain control of program execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute code and set resource limits.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a solid understanding of memory management, stack operation, and system calls to exploit the vulnerability.
