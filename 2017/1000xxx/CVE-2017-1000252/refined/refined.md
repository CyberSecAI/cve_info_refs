Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-1000252:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability exists within the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically when handling posted interrupts on x86 systems. A flaw in how guest IRQ values are validated in the `vmx_update_pi_irte()` function can lead to an assertion failure, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending out-of-bounds guest IRQ values via the KVM\_IRQFD API, causing the hypervisor to hang or crash.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The `vmx_update_pi_irte()` function in the Linux kernel's KVM module uses a guest-provided IRQ number to update the interrupt routing table (IRTE) for posted interrupts.
*   There is a missing input validation, allowing a guest to supply an out-of-bounds `guest_irq` value.
*   When the provided value exceeds the bounds of the IRTE, a `BUG_ON` assertion is triggered, causing the kernel to panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing input validation:** The `vmx_update_pi_irte()` function fails to check if the provided `guest_irq` value is within the valid range of IRQ routes, leading to an out-of-bounds access.
*   **Assertion Failure:** The `BUG_ON()` macro is used to check for invalid `guest_irq` values. Upon detecting an out-of-bounds value, the assertion causes the kernel to halt (panic) instead of gracefully handling the error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a DoS, where the KVM hypervisor becomes unresponsive due to the assertion failure and the resulting kernel panic, impacting all guests running on the hypervisor.
*   **Potential Hypervisor Crash:** The vulnerability can cause a complete hypervisor crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local User Inside Guest VM:** An attacker needs to have a user/process inside a guest operating system to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **KVM_IRQFD API:** The exploit is triggered by supplying an out-of-bounds `guest_irq` value through the KVM\_IRQFD API

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account inside a guest operating system that can make KVM API calls to trigger this condition.
*   Ability to interact with the `/dev/kvm` device within the guest.
*   Knowledge of how to send an invalid `guest_irq` value using the KVM API, specifically the KVM\_IRQFD call.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel version 4.4
*   The vulnerability is fixed by performing the input validation and logging errors instead of crashing the hypervisor.
*   The fix also prevents out-of-bounds gsi values from entering the system at the `kvm_irqfd()` function.
*  The vulnerability impacts  Linux kernel built with KVM visualization support (CONFIG_KVM) and with Virtual Function I/O feature enabled (CONFIG_VFIO).
*   Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of "Moderate".
