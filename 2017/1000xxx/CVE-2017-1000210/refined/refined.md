The content is related to CVE-2017-1000210.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `pico_dns_decompress_name` function in picoTCP has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to an unbounded loop that continues until a null terminator is found.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow in `pico_dns_decompress_name` function due to missing length checks, allowing data to be written past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a stack overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by sending a specially crafted DNS packet.
- `pico_mdns_handle_data_as_answers_generic` and `pico_mdns_handle_single_question` would also have crashed if `pico_dns_decompress_name` returned NULL, instead of an allocated buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted DNS packet with a name that does not contain a null terminator within the expected buffer length.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system running picoTCP, and this system needs to be using the vulnerable `pico_dns_decompress_name` function to process the packets.
