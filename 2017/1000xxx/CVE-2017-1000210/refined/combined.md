### @shachy12 **[shachy12](/shachy12)** commented [Jul 12, 2017](#issue-242329857)

Hi,

I fixed the stack overflow in the function **pico\_dns\_decompress\_name**.

In this function we had a buffer with a size of 256 bytes which is being filled inside a while loop.

The problem is that the break condition of this loop stops the loop only when reaching to a null terminator byte. An attacker can cause a stack overflow and possibly run an arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted packet.

Also, the functions **pico\_mdns\_handle\_data\_as\_answers\_generic** and **pico\_mdns\_handle\_single\_question** would have crashed if pico\_dns\_decompress\_name returns NULL instead of an allocated buffer so I added a fix to them too.

Sorry, something went wrong.
