Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-provided input when creating or editing pages in Sulu CMS. Specifically, the CMS fails to properly sanitize the `src` attribute of `iframe` tags, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then stored and executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Stealing sensitive information
  - Other malicious activities that can be performed within the browser context

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the page editing functionality of the Sulu CMS. An attacker with page editing permissions can insert malicious code through the WYSIWYG editor's source code view.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have user account with page editing permissions in Sulu CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the CMS editing interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the HTML content through the source code editor.
