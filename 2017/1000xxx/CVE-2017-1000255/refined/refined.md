  "CVE-2017-1000255": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels handling of signal frame processing where any user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's improper handling of signal frames on PowerPC systems, specifically when processing sigreturn. The kernel uses the stack pointer (r1) value from the crafted signal frame, which an attacker can manipulate, resulting in the overwrite of arbitrary locations in kernel memory during exception entry.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary stack overwrite"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious local user process can cause an arbitrary kernel memory overwrite, leading to a kernel crash (oops). A panic may occur if the panic_on_oops setting is enabled. The corruption of kernel memory occurs before the crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted signal frame"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged attacker is required to craft a malicious signal frame and execute sigreturn.",
    "affected_systems": [
      "PowerPC systems running on Power8 or later processors."
    ],
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was introduced by commit 5d176f751ee3 and fixed by commit 265e60a170d0a0ecfc2d20490134ed2c48dd45ab upstream."
