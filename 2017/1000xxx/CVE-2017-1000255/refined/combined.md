## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

## What we do:

* [Compliance and certification](/en/solutions/compliance-approach "Red Hat compliance and certification")
* [Incident response](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerability-management)
* [Hybrid cloud security](/en/solutions/hybrid-cloud-security-approach "Red Hat’s approach to hybrid cloud security")
* [Secure software development practices](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/red-hat-sdl)

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0654)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: kernel-alt (4.14.0). (BZ#1492717)

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.

Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715, Important, ARM)

Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5753, Important, ARM)

Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5754, Important, ARM)

* kernel: memory leak when merging buffers in SCSI IO vectors (CVE-2017-12190, Moderate)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1501794#c0)  Zorro Lang    2017-10-13 08:38:05 UTC  ``` Description of problem: xfstests generic/448 fails on XFS, it tests negative SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA offset.  Ext4 has fixed this bug on [bug 1494423](show_bug.cgi?id=1494423). Then upstream found and fixed this bug later. I think below patch maybe help.  commit d6ab17f261919d212ec0a9e33d01f46df0ec1fde Author: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong> Date:   Wed Jul 12 10:26:47 2017 -0700      vfs: in iomap seek_{hole,data}, return -ENXIO for negative offsets  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-4.11.0-42.el7a  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: run xfstests generic/448 on XFS  Actual results: # cat results/generic/448.full  File system magic#: 0x58465342 Allocation size: 4096  18. Test file with negative SEEK_{HOLE,DATA} offsets   18.01 SEEK_HOLE expected -1 or -1, got 0.                         FAIL 18.02 SEEK_DATA expected -1 with errno -6, got -1.                FAIL  seek sanity check failed!  Expected results: Test pass  Additional info: This bug is not so urgent, and Pegas-1.0 is goint to be released, so I think fix it on "rhel-7.5-alt" is fine. Feel feel to change it to pages-1.0 if devel would like to do that.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1501794#c1)  Brian Foster    2017-10-16 13:53:04 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1502483](show_bug.cgi?id=1502483) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1501794#c2)  IBM Bug Proxy    2017-10-16 14:20:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1339252](attachment.cgi?id=1339252 "dmesg") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1339252&action=edit "dmesg") dmesg   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1501794#c6)  IBM Bug Proxy    2017-11-22 07:10:45 UTC  ``` ------- Comment From mainamdar.com 2017-11-22 02:03 EDT------- *** [Bug 159723](show_bug.cgi?id=159723 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - Display of birthdays from evolution in the calender applet is too big for window.") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1501794#c7)  IBM Bug Proxy    2017-12-08 09:20:49 UTC  ``` ------- Comment From hasriram.com 2017-12-08 04:15 EDT------- Test passed with kernel 4.14.0-6.el7a.ppc64le.  # ./check tests/generic/448 FSTYP         -- xfs (non-debug) PLATFORM      -- Linux/ppc64le ltc-boston27 4.14.0-6.el7a.ppc64le MKFS_OPTIONS  -- -f -bsize=4096 /dev/loop2 MOUNT_OPTIONS -- -o context=system_u:object_r:root_t:s0 /dev/loop2 /home/scratch  generic/448	 0s Ran: generic/448 Passed all 1 tests  Thanks, Harish   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1501794#c8)  Zorro Lang    2018-01-16 10:24:37 UTC  ``` generic/448 test passed on ext2/3/4 and XFS of RHEL-ALT-7.5 with kernel-4.14.0-24.el7a.aarch64.debug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1498067#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-03 12:35:18 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels handling of signal frame processing where any user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written.  This flaw only affects PowerPC systems running on Power8 or later processors.
