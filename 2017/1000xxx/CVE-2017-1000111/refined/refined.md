{
  "CVE-2017-1000111": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition in the Linux kernel's raw packet socket implementation leads to a use-after-free issue.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker with the CAP_NET_RAW capability can cause a denial of service by wasting resources in the kernel's ring buffer, or potentially trigger an out-of-bounds read on the heap leading to a system crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "Attack vectors": [
       "Local Access"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability. This can also be achieved if unprivileged user namespaces are available."
