Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000421:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `gifview` tool of `gifsicle`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** A GIF image object (`gfi`) is freed prematurely within the `gifread.c` file, but is accessed later in the same function, leading to the use-after-free vulnerability. The `gfi` object is freed at line 829 due to an image reading error, and then accessed again at lines 886-893. It is then freed again at line 896, potentially causing a double-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution is possible through the use-after-free vulnerability. This is because the freed memory could be reallocated for other purposes, and subsequent access to `gfi` would lead to unexpected behavior, including the ability to overwrite memory with malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted or corrupted GIF image file.
- The vulnerability occurs in `gifview`, which is used to view gif files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted GIF image to be processed by `gifsicle`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found and reported by `junxzm1990` on github and is documented in issue #114.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in the Debian packages:
    *   1.86-1+deb8u1 for jessie (oldstable)
    *   1.88-3+deb9u1 for stretch (stable)
    *   1.67-1.1~deb7u1 for wheezy (Debian 7 LTS)

This analysis provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than the original CVE description, which only states that a flaw in `gifsicle` could lead to arbitrary code execution.
