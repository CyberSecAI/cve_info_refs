- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of an `Accept` header containing an unsupported media range that begins with a wildcard but specifies a subtype (e.g., `*/boom`). This causes a stack overflow during content type negotiation within the Akka HTTP framework.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The weakness lies in the Akka HTTP framework's handling of malformed Accept headers, specifically those with wildcard media ranges followed by subtypes, which triggers an infinite recursion leading to a `StackOverflowError`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The `StackOverflowError` crashes the JVM process, effectively shutting down the Akka HTTP server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malformed `Accept` header to a vulnerable Akka HTTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted Akka HTTP server. No special position or authentication is required.
