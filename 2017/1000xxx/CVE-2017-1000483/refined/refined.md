The provided content mentions "Sandbox escape" in the context of a Plone hotfix (20171128), which is relevant to security vulnerabilities, but it doesn't provide specific details regarding the vulnerability, root cause, impact, or attack vectors. It only mentions that a sandbox escape is addressed.

Based on this, I can only provide a limited extraction.

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: Not specified, only "Sandbox escape" is mentioned.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sandbox escape vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation**: Not specified, but implies a security breach where an attacker can escape the intended sandbox environment.
* **Attack vectors**: Not specified.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Not specified.

Given the limited information, the response is:

```
