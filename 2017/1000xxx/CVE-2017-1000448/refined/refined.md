The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1000448.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation in the online RDFa linter tool. Specifically, the tool doesn't verify if the provided input is a valid URL, leading it to attempt to open the input as a local file if no protocol is specified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability: By using relative paths (e.g., `../etc/ssh`), an attacker can access files and directories outside the intended web application directory.
- Information disclosure: The application leaks information about the file system, contents of configuration files and system services through error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially:
- Determine the existence of directories on the server.
- Read sensitive files such as `/etc/os-release`, `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`.
- Identify installed services and their configurations.
- Determine if specific sockets are present or not.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides a crafted input to the online RDFa linter tool through the URL input field. This input can include relative paths or absolute file system paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the online RDFa linter tool.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the URL field in the tool.
