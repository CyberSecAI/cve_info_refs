{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the UnregisterHandler method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "NULL pointer dereference",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could call the UnregisterHandler method with a non-existing tcmu handler as parameter, causing a denial of service by triggering a segmentation fault in the tcmu-runner daemon.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted message via the D-Bus system bus.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus."
