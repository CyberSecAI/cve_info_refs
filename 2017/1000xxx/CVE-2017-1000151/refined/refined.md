- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Parameter values, including sensitive data like passwords, were being printed in log files during stack traces. This could occur even if parameters were not explicitly named as passwords or passed through general-purpose functions that might handle sensitive data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data exposure through logs, specifically within stack traces.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, including passwords, by viewing the logs.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the server's log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to server's log files.

The vulnerability arises because the application logs parameter values during stack traces, including parameters containing sensitive data such as passwords. The fix involves refraining from printing parameter values in logs when the application is in production mode. When not in production mode, parameter values are printed but with known password parameters scrubbed. This prevents the exposure of sensitive information in the logs when the application is running in a production environment, while still retaining debugging information in non-production environments.
