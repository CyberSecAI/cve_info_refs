- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly filter or sanitize JavaScript code when creating pages, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which will be executed when other users view that page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the page creation functionality and directly injecting malicious Javascript through the source code editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have an account that is able to create pages in a BookStack instance.
