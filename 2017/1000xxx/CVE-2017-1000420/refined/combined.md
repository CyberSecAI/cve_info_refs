## Description

[![@calmh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?u=43157627b33d10997db7ee408a0557ab54c40146&v=4&size=48)](/calmh)[calmh](https://github.com/calmh)opened [on Aug 7, 2017](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4286#issue-248314146)

Syncthing erronously versions symlinks when they are deleted. If a directory is then created with the same name, a file created in that directory, and the file deleted, it is moved into the symlink target.
