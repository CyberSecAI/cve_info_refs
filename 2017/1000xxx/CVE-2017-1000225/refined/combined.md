## Advisory:

# Reflected XSS in Relevanssi Premium when using relevanssi\_didyoumean() could allow unauthenticated attacker to do almost anything an admin can

## Vulnerability

Last revised: February 13, 2017

Relevanssi Premium contains a function called `relevanssi_didyoumean` which is meant to be added to the theme by theme authors.

That function tokenises the search query, and passes each token to a “spellchecker” which looks for terms in the database which are similar. If there are possible spelling mistakes, the tokens are replaced and the function prints “Did you mean:” followed by the new query. The new query is not escaped before being printed.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

* Set the current theme to twentyseventeen
* Follow [the instructions](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/did-you-mean-suggestions/) by adding `<?php if (function_exists('relevanssi_didyoumean')) { relevanssi_didyoumean(get_search_query(), "<p>Did you mean: ", "</p>", 5); }?>` to the file search.php after `get_header()`
* Create a post with title “meow” (it may not work if there are any posts containing “meo”)
* Visit the Relevanssi Premium settings page and click “Build the index”
* Visit `/?s=meo%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E` using a browser without XSS prevention (i.e. Firefox)

## Testimonials

Relevanssi customer service was fantastic. When the project I was working on got cancelled shortly after purchasing Relevanssi Premium, they were quick to provide me with a full refund without any hassle at all. Thank you Mikko and the Relevanssi team.

## Matt H

I wanted to boost the regular search function for a website that
contains many documents. I wanted to achieve that searching could be
performed much more accurately and visitors are served faster. For this
I bought the Relevanssi premium plugin. I received fantastic and fast
help for the installation. I strongly recommend going a step further and
buy the premium version!

## Bart / NL34

I’d just like to give a shout out to how awesome this plugin is (Premium version). I have a site with pages, standard posts and a custom post for a document library where a couple gigs of PDFs are stored on AWS S3 using another plugin, and Relevanssi does a full-text index of all of it and returns context-sensitive results in less than a second. Plus good documentation and a responsive developer. This is the stuff of dreams.

## Power up your WordPress search

Relevanssi has bunch of [features](https://www.relevanssi.com/features/ "Features") and lots of room for customization.

But it's not really about features, it's about what you get from using Relevanssi:

* **Better results** for your users, which means **happy users**.
* **Better control over search results** for you.
* **Better experience for both you and your users**.
![Mikko Saari](/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mikko-1024x1024.jpg)

**Meet the developer of Relevanssi**

Relevanssi is the work of one person, Mikko Saari, a developer from Tampere, Finland. I'm doing Relevanssi alone.

This means that every support request you make gets you in direct contact with the one person who cares most and knows best.

What comes to long time commitment, I'm dedicated to running Relevanssi. I've been doing it for a decade now. Relevanssi pays my bills and feeds my family, so I'm highly motivated to keeping it going.

## Free or Premium

Relevanssi comes in two flavours. **Free version of Relevanssi** is available from [WordPress Plugin Repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/relevanssi/). It does the job and has over 1,600,000 downloads and more than 100,000 active installations and many satisfied users. For those who want something better, there's **Relevanssi Premium**, which you can buy here.

So why go Premium, when the free version is available?

* **Guaranteed support**. Free version users get support if I have enough time available.
* **Additional features**. Relevanssi is developed actively and new features are added. Free version users won't get the new features, or get them long after Premium users have enjoyed them.
* **Future development**. More users for Relevanssi Premium means I can spend more time developing the plugin.

[See Relevanssi Premium prices and buy yours here!](https://www.relevanssi.com/buy-premium/ "Buy Premium")

## Licensing options explained

There are two different licensing options:

* **Annual** is valid for a year and provides access to upgrades and support. Once a year has passed, the plugin will still work, but you won’t get access to upgrades, support or attachment indexing services, until you renew the license.
* **Permanent** gives you lifetime access to upgrades and support.

Both licenses let you use Relevanssi on unlimited number of sites, Relevanssi use is not restricted to a limited number of sites.

The annual license include support and upgrades for a year. It is not a subscription: once a year has passed, the license expires and you need to renew if you want it to continue, but you will not be billed automatically.

## Custom search development

Relevanssi is a great plugin, but it can't cover all specialized needs. It can be adapted to many demands with custom modifications, though, so just contact me and we can build you the **custom search plugin you need**, based on the awesome power of Relevanssi.

## [Premium 2.26 / Free 4.23 release notes](https://www.relevanssi.com/release-notes/premium-2-26-free-4-23-release-notes/)

This version includes bug fixes, small quality-of-life improvements, and a small security fix. In earlier versions, Relevanssi included password-protected posts in the search results. This can be used to glean information about the posts’ contents. Since I know some people will still need this functionality, the old behaviour can be enabled with a filter function.…

## [GeneratePress: Query Loop](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/generatepress-query-loop/)

Relevanssi doesn’t work automatically with the Query Loop block in GeneratePress and GenerateBlocks. Fortunately, the solution is simple: the Query Loop block has a filter hook for adjusting the query parameters, and you can use that filter hook to enable Relevanssi. Add this to your site: Thanks to Ben Knowles.
