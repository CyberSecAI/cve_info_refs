The content is related to CVE-2017-1000143.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control checks in the `togglewatchlist.json.php` file, which allows users to add pages to their watchlist even if they do not have access to view those pages. Additionally, the watchlist notification system does not properly check view permissions, leading to users receiving notifications about changes to pages they no longer have access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control checks in `togglewatchlist.json.php`.
-  Watchlist notifications are sent even if the user no longer has access to the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Users can add private pages to their watchlist.
- Users can receive notifications about changes to private pages, which includes the page title and names of blocks/artifacts changed, potentially revealing information about private content to unauthorized users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the `viewid` parameter in the HTML code using browser developer tools (e.g., Firebug) and sending a request to `togglewatchlist.json.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Mahara platform.
- They need to have some understanding of web development and be able to use browser developer tools to manipulate HTML elements and HTTP requests.
- They need to know the `viewid` of a private page, which they could obtain through a user who has access to the page.
