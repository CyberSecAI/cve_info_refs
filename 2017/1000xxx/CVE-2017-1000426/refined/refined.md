The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000426.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The format and srs parameters in the WMS/WMTS/TMS demo pages of MapProxy are not properly escaped. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could lead to information disclosure, such as session cookies of other applications running on the same domain. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the manipulation of the `format` and `srs` parameters in the WMS/WMTS/TMS demo page URLs. By crafting a URL with malicious JavaScript code in these parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the payload. The attacker does not need any special access, other than being able to access a vulnerable server's demo page and send the manipulated URL to a victim.
