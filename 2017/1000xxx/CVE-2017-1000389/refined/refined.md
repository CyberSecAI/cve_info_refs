The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000389.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The global-build-stats plugin returned JSON responses with `Content-Type: text/html`, which could be interpreted as HTML by clients, leading to reflected cross-site scripting. Additionally, some URLs for modifying data didn't require POST requests, leading to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
2.  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Reflected XSS: An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into a user's browser session via crafted URLs, leading to various attacks, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   CSRF: An attacker could potentially induce users to make unwanted changes to the application state via crafted requests, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Reflected XSS: Attacker crafts malicious URLs containing JavaScript code that, when visited by the victim, is executed in their browser within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   CSRF: Attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that contains a request to the vulnerable application. When a logged in user visits the page, their browser executes the crafted request without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   For Reflected XSS: An attacker would need the victim to click on a crafted URL
*   For CSRF: An attacker would need a logged in user to visit a crafted page
