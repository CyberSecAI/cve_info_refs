I had plans from the beginning to diverge from Dashing/Smashing and that’s why there’s nowhere in the documentation a promise for compatibility between the projects. Building it on some of the conventions of Dashing though can hopefully make people using it more productive and eager to port existing dashboards to Kitto (and even find an excuse to introduce Elixir at work ![:innocent:](https://elixirforum.com/images/emoji/apple/innocent.png?v=9 ":innocent:"))

Concerning your question abou the `text` widget, you’re right about it having only one dynamic attribute at the moment.

Changing it to have more or all of its attributes dynamic is quite simple and i wouldn’t mind if the default generated text widget

had all of them dynamic (feel free to submit a PR about this).

Keep in mind that even core widgets are generated in any new dashboard app instead of being bundled somehow to allow the user to see the source code, and adapt it accordingly.
