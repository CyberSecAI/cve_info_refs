**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The autocompletion suggestions for text fields were not escaped.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Persisted Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code via autocompletion suggestions that is then executed in the browsers of other users when those suggestions are displayed. This can potentially lead to stealing of cookies, session hijacking, or other malicious activity.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can inject malicious code through the text fields that allow autocompletion suggestions. The source for these suggestions allowed specifying text that includes HTML metacharacters. Vulnerable sources of these suggestions include names of loggers in the log recorder condition, and agent labels.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to define or manipulate the source of the autocompletion suggestions, such as the names of loggers in the log recorder condition, or agent labels. The attacker also requires high privileges (PR:H). They also need to induce a user to view the maliciously crafted text input with XSS. (UI:R)
