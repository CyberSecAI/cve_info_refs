Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The ONOS system allows the use of websockets without authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authentication requirements for accessing and using websocket endpoints in ONOS. This allows anyone to connect to these endpoints and execute their provided functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access and Control:** An unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability to access and manipulate the functionalities exposed by websocket endpoints. The specific impact depends on what functionalities are available through the exposed websocket endpoints.
*   **Potential for Wider Compromise:** Depending on the exposed functionalities, this could lead to control of network devices managed by ONOS, data exfiltration, or further manipulation of the ONOS system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker only needs to be able to connect to the ONOS system's network and access the websocket ports.
*   **Direct Connection to Websocket Endpoints:** Attackers can directly connect to the exposed websocket endpoints without needing to log in or be authenticated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the ONOS instance.
*   **Knowledge of websocket endpoints:** The attacker likely needs some knowledge of the websocket endpoints that are exposed and what their functionalities are.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that the vulnerability is considered "Important."
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to affect ONOS versions 1.8.0 and 1.9.0.
*   Patches were committed to versions 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10 and will be included in future builds.
