```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `gravity_lexer_t` structure's memory is freed multiple times due to issues with how nested lexers are handled during string interpolation, leading to double-free and use-after-free conditions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap Double Free",
    "Heap Use-After-Free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A double-free vulnerability can lead to program crashes, denial of service or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate the heap. The use-after-free vulnerability can also lead to arbitrary code execution if memory is reused after it has been freed.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific input string that includes string interpolation, which causes the code to recursively create and free lexer objects. The attacker could use a specifically crafted string containing interpolations to trigger the double-free.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable parser. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
