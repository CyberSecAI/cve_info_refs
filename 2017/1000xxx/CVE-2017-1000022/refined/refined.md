- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper rights partitioning in LogicalDOC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  Authenticated users, even with the lowest privileges (guest account), can trigger administrative functions due to lack of proper access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Low-privileged users can perform critical administrative actions such as:
        - Listing all connected users and their session cookies (ldoc-sid).
        - Changing administrator or user passwords.
        - Getting and changing application settings.
        - Changing user settings and usernames.
    - In older versions, the vulnerability could be exploited by unauthenticated users.
    - Effective elevation of privilege to administrator level for any authenticated user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network access to the LogicalDOC web interface.
    - Attacker needs to be authenticated with a valid account, even with minimal privileges.
    - Exploitation involves sending crafted requests with a valid session cookie (ldoc-sid), which can be obtained from the listing users function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs a valid user account on the vulnerable LogicalDOC instance.
    - Basic understanding of HTTP request formats and the ability to send crafted requests.
