{
  "CVE-2017-1000101": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The URL globbing function in curl does not properly handle numerical ranges, leading to an out-of-bounds read when parsing a specially crafted URL.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information from process memory by causing curl to read beyond the allocated buffer. The application might terminate unexpectedly or disclose memory contents.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted URL with a numerical range to the curl command-line tool.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious URL to the curl command-line tool."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The globbing function in curl that parses the numerical range has an omission that causes curl to read a byte beyond the end of the URL, stored in a heap-based buffer.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Heap-based buffer over-read"
      ],
       "Impact of exploitation": "A physically proximate attacker could potentially read sensitive information from a workstation screen during use of curl.",
      "Attack vectors": "A crafted URL using the --write-out argument ending in a '%' character.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Physically proximate attacker observing a workstation screen during execution of curl."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "When doing a TFTP upload with a very long file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "The send() function will attempt to read and send more data than is actually present in the buffer. This will read beyond the end of the heap based buffer and may lead to disclosure of information from the memory.",
      "Attack vectors": "A TFTP upload with a URL containing an excessively long file name.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to make a system attempt a TFTP upload with an URL with a long filename."
