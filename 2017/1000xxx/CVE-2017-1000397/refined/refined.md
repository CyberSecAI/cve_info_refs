**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful man-in-the-middle attack could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially modify communications between Jenkins and other systems/servers, which could lead to data breaches or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between a Jenkins instance using a vulnerable Maven Plugin version and a server it communicates with.
