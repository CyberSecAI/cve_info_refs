  "CVE-2017-1000358": {
    "relevant_content": true,
    "summary": "This document describes the application of fuzzing techniques to discover vulnerabilities in SDN controllers like OpenDaylight and ONOS, focusing on the OpenFlow protocol implementation. It details the fuzzing process, test case design based on threat modeling, and the vulnerabilities found.",
    "root_cause": "The root causes of the discovered vulnerabilities include incorrect parsing of OpenFlow packets, lack of proper thread management, and improper handling of certain packet types/values, especially in error handling and processing of multipart requests. Additionally, issues with the xsql module led to denial-of-service vulnerabilities. In some cases, incorrect implementation of REST API interactions also resulted in issues.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Resource Exhaustion",
        "Insufficient Thread Management",
        "Unhandled Exceptions",
        "Incorrect Protocol Parsing",
		"Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploitation includes denial-of-service attacks causing controller crashes, resource exhaustion leading to increased CPU and memory consumption, and the inability of legitimate applications to add flows. There are also several exceptions thrown during vulnerability exploitation that can cause denial of services or log file exhaustion. The vulnerabilities can potentially disrupt network operations, cause theft of sensitive data if combined with other exploits, and lead to financial losses.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attack vectors include sending manipulated or malformed OpenFlow packets from a compromised or malicious switch to the controller through the southbound interface (ports 6633 and 6653). For xsql related vulnerabilities, the attack vector is sending crafted packets to ports 40004 and 34343. REST API is also an attack vector through which specific vulnerabilities can be targeted.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to connect to the SDN controller's OpenFlow interface (ports 6633 or 6653) or, in some cases, the xsql modules through ports 40004 and 34343 or through REST API. This can be achieved by compromising a network switch or simulating a switch. The attacker needs to have knowledge of the OpenFlow protocol and be able to craft or manipulate packets to trigger the vulnerabilities."
