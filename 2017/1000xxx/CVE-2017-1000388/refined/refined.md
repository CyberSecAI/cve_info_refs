Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000388:

**CVE-2017-1000388**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Dependency Graph Viewer plugin lacked permission checks for an API endpoint that modifies the dependency graph.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Missing authorization/permission check.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can modify the dependency graph. This could lead to altered build dependencies, potentially causing build failures, unexpected behavior, or even introducing malicious code into the build process by modifying the graph.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the Jenkins instance. Specifically, the API endpoint for modifying the dependency graph is exposed without adequate permission controls.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission to the Jenkins instance to exploit this. This means having an account on the Jenkins system, potentially as a regular user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that the fix requires users to have permission to configure *all* jobs involved in the operation, a stricter permission requirement than simply having Overall/Read access, which is the case when exploited.
*   The advisory specifies that the affected versions of the plugin are up to and including version 0.12.
*   The fix is available in version 0.13 of the plugin.
