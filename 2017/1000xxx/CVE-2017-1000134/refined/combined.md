### Bug Description

I have a group, 'Group1' that has some members

I log in as Member A, upload an image file to a group files and makes sure the role perms are all ticked for the file.

I then log out and log in as Member B and I can un-tick the member and tutor options for that file.

On saving I can't see the file, which is correct.

I then log out and in as Member A again. I can see the file listed in group files list but without the image icon and when I click on the filename I get Access denied message.

It will also stop me from being able to download the file when using a 'Files to download' block

Conversely, the image will display in a image gallery block even for other members, who are not allowed to view image file.

As Member A I can edit the file and re-tick the member role boxes to get proper access back - but is a bit of a pain if I have many files and another member has removed member role permissions.
