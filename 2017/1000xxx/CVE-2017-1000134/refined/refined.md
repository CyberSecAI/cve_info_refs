- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect access control mechanism for group files in Mahara. Specifically, a member of a group can modify the permissions of a file uploaded by another group member, removing that member's access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -   **Broken Access Control**: Group members can modify access permissions of files uploaded by other members, which should not be possible.
    -   **Inconsistent Permissions Handling**: A user might be blocked from accessing a file directly but still see it displayed in an image gallery block.
    -   **Loss of Access**: The original uploader loses access to their files due to modifications done by other group members.
-   **Impact of exploitation**:
    -   **Denial of Access**: Legitimate users can be prevented from accessing their own files, causing disruption and data loss.
    -   **Data Inconsistency**: Files can be visible in some contexts (e.g., image gallery) and inaccessible in others (e.g., file list).
    -   **User Frustration**: Users have to manually correct the permissions to restore their access to the files.
-   **Attack vectors**:
    -   **Through Group Membership**: An attacker needs to be a member of the same group as the victim to exploit this vulnerability.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -   The attacker must be a member of the same group as the victim.
    -   The attacker must be able to access and modify file permissions within the group file management interface.
    -   No privilege escalation is necessary for the attack.
