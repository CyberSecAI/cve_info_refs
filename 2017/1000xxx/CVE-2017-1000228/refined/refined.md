{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ejs` templating engine allows users to control the `root` option, which specifies the base directory for included files. This can be exploited by passing user-controlled data that includes the `root` option in the data object of `ejs.render()` or `ejs.renderFile()`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain Remote Code Execution by manipulating the root directory for included scripts, redirecting it to a location controlled by the attacker and executing malicious code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "User-provided data in templates"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to influence the options passed to `ejs.render()` or `ejs.renderFile()`, specifically through the data argument of these functions. The attacker does not require any prior access to the vulnerable system."
  },
  "affected_versions": "<2.5.3",
  "fix_versions": ">=2.5.3",
  "details": "The vulnerability arises because the `ejs` engine allows the `root` option to be passed as part of the `data` object when calling `ejs.render()` or `ejs.renderFile()`. This `root` option controls the base directory for included files. An attacker can control this option, and provide their own directory to be used, to include and execute arbitrary scripts. The fix for the vulnerability blacklists the `root` option from the options passed via the data object."
