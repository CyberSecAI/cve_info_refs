Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing access control check in the `group/edit.php` file. This allows any member of a group to access and modify the group's settings directly via the URL, even if they do not have administrative privileges within the group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing a user to access the group settings page (`group/edit.php`). The application fails to verify if the user has the necessary admin role within the group before granting access to modify the group settings.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The application uses the group ID in the URL (`?id=3`) to reference the target group. This is vulnerable because there are no permission checks associated with the object access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Modification of Group Settings:** A regular group member, without admin privileges, can modify sensitive group configurations.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** By changing group settings, an attacker could alter the group's functionality, potentially disrupting the group's normal operation or causing harm to its members. The specific impact would depend on what settings could be modified (not detailed in the provided text)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker simply needs to know the group's ID and craft a URL to `group/edit.php` with the corresponding ID (`http://my.mahara/group/edit.php?id=X`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a member of the targeted group.
- They need to know or guess the group's ID to construct the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report explicitly states that only the admin should be able to modify the group's settings, which was not being enforced.
- Patches were created and applied to multiple branches (15.04, 15.10, and 16.04).
- The fix involves limiting group configuration to only the group's admins.
