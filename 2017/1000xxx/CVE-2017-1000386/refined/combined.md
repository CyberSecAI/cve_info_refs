# Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-10-23

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in these Jenkins plugins:

* [Active Choices](https://plugins.jenkins.io/uno-choice) (uno-choice)
* [Build-Publisher](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-publisher)
* [Dependency Graph Viewer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/depgraph-view)
* [global-build-stats](https://plugins.jenkins.io/global-build-stats)
* [Multijob](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jenkins-multijob-plugin)
* [SCP publisher](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scp)

## Description

### Persisted Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Active Choices plugin

**SECURITY-470 / CVE-2017-1000386**

Active Choices plugin allowed users with Job/Configure permission to provide arbitrary HTML to be shown on the *Build With Parameters* page through the *Active Choices Reactive Reference Parameter* type.
This could include, for example, arbitrary JavaScript.

Active Choices now sanitizes the HTML inserted on the *Build With Parameters* page if and only if the script is executed in a sandbox.
As unsandboxed scripts are subject to administrator approval, it is up to the administrator to allow or disallow problematic script output.

|  | Sandboxed Groovy scripts for *Active Choices Reactive Reference Parameter* will no longer emit HTML that is considered unsafe, such as `<script>` tags. This may result in behavior changes on *Build With Parameters* forms, such as missing elements.   To resolve this issue, Groovy scripts emitting HTML will need to be configured to run outside the script security sandbox, possibly requiring separate administrator approval in *In-Process Script Approval*. |

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in global-build-stats plugin

**SECURITY-50 / CVE-2017-1000389**

Some URLs provided by global-build-stats plugin returned a JSON response that contained request parameters.
These responses had the `Content Type: text/html`, so could have been interpreted as HTML by clients, resulting in a potential reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Additionally, some URLs provided by global-build-stats plugin that modify data did not require `POST` requests to be sent, resulting in a potential cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

Affected URLs now specify the correct `Content-Type` for JSON responses, and require that requests be sent via `POST`.

### Missing permission checks in Dependency Graph Viewer plugin

**SECURITY-57 / CVE-2017-1000388**

Dependency Graph Viewer plugin did not perform permission checks for the API endpoint that modifies the dependency graph, allowing anyone with Overall/Read permission to modify this data.

Dependency graph modification now requires that users have the permission to configure all jobs involved in the operation.

### Build-Publisher plugin stores Jenkins credentials unencrypted on disk, round-trips in unencrypted form

**SECURITY-378 / CVE-2017-1000387**

Build-Publisher plugin stores credentials to other Jenkins instances in the file `hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml` in the Jenkins controller home directory.
These credentials were stored unencrypted, allowing anyone with local file system access to access them.

Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This could result in exposure of the credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Build-Publisher Plugin now encrypts the credentials on disk, and only transmits their encrypted form to users viewing the configuration form.

### Missing permission check in Multijob plugin Resume Build action

**JENKINS-36333 / CVE-2017-1000390**

Multijob plugin did not check permissions in the Resume Build action, allowing anyone with Job/Read permission to resume the build.

Multijob plugin 1.26 introduced a permission check requiring Overall/Administer. This was lowered to Job/Build in version 1.27.

### SCP publisher plugin stores credentials unencrypted on disk, round-trips in unencrypted form

**SECURITY-374**

SCP publisher plugin stores SSH credentials in the file `be.certipost.hudson.plugin.SCPRepositoryPublisher.xml` in the Jenkins controller home directory.
These credentials are stored unencrypted, allowing anyone with local file system access to access them.

Additionally, the credentials are also transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This could result in exposure of credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# SCP publisher

How to installThe Jenkins project announced unresolved security vulnerabilities affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):

* **[Insecure credential storage and transmission](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-10-23/)**
* **[CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-02-15/#SECURITY-2323)**

**Deprecated:** This plugin has been marked as [deprecated](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/deprecating-or-removing-plugin). In general, this means that this plugin is either obsolete, no longer being developed, or may no longer work.

More information about the cause of this deprecation, and suggestions on how to proceed may be found at <https://github.com/jenkinsci/scp-plugin/blob/master/README.md>.

* [Issues](/scp/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/scp/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/scp/healthscore/)

This plugin uploads build artifacts to repository sites using SCP (SSH)
protocol. First you should define SCP hosts on hudson global config
page. After that you can refer to this hosts using select list. See
picture for global config:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/scp/docs/images/scp-1.jpg)

After entering username/password automatic logon check is performed to
see if you entered it correctly.

Root repository path must exist before you can reference it and should
be accessible by user who do publish of files.

---

Then per job you can enable publishing of build artifacts:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/scp/docs/images/scp-2.jpg)

*Source* points to files which will be uploaded. You can use ant
includes syntax, eg. folder/dist/\*.jar. Path is constructed from
workspace root.

Note that you cannot point files outside the *workspace* directory. For
example providing: `../myfile.txt` won't work...

*Destination* points to destination folder on remote site. It will be
created if doesn't exists and relative to root repository path.

You can define multiple blocks of source/destination pairs.
