      "details": {
        "root_cause": "A flaw in how memory is allocated on the stack for user space binaries. If a heap (or different memory region) and stack memory regions are adjacent to each other, an attacker can use this flaw to jump over the stack guard gap.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Unbounded stack allocation",
          "Insufficient stack guard gap"
        ],
        "impact": "Controlled memory corruption on the process stack or the adjacent memory region, and thus privilege escalation.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "By carefully arranging the stack and heap memory layout, an attacker can cause a stack clash and bypass stack protections.",
          "Local, unprivileged users can exploit this flaw to elevate their privileges."

        "required_capabilities": "Local, unprivileged user to run specially crafted binary.",
         "additional_notes": "The exploit-db content provides a detailed example of a local privilege escalation exploit using this vulnerability. The provided source code shows how to manipulate the stack using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_HWCAP_MASK` environment variables, along with strategically placed libraries. It includes methods for bypassing the stack guard-page, and achieving privilege escalation in various Linux distributions. The redhat advisories provide specific package information related to the fixes."
