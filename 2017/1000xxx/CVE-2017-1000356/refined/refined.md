Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2017-1000356 is the lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in various Jenkins administrative actions. The application did not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing malicious actors to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities were present, allowing unauthorized actions. These vulnerabilities included:
  * Lack of CSRF token validation.
  * Usage of GET requests for state-changing operations.
  * Failure to require POST requests for sensitive actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allowed malicious users to perform a wide range of administrative actions, including:
* Restarting Jenkins, with different options (immediately, after builds, after plugin installs).
* Downgrading Jenkins to a previous version.
* Installing and loading arbitrary plugins.
* Removing update sites.
* Changing a user's API token.
* Submitting system and security configurations.
* Creating user accounts (with potential admin privileges).
* Creating new agents and potentially executing shell commands.
* Canceling scheduled restarts.
* Configuring logging levels.
* Creating copies of agents and views.
* Entering "quiet down" mode.
* Restarting or installing Jenkins as a Windows service.
* Modifying descriptions of items, builds and users.
* Submitting global tool configuration.
* Toggling build retention settings.
* Connecting all disconnected agents simultaneously.
* Updating node monitor data on all agents.

**Attack Vectors:**
Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities by:
* Tricking a victim into opening a malicious web page.
* Embedding malicious links in emails, forums, or other websites.
* Utilizing HTML image tags to automatically load attack links.
* Exploiting the fact that browsers automatically include cookies in requests to the target domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or forms targeting vulnerable Jenkins endpoints.
* The attacker needs to trick a logged-in Jenkins user into accessing a malicious link/page.
* No specific user privilege is needed on the Jenkins instance itself, the attack relies on a valid session of a victim user.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content from Wikipedia on CSRF provides a general understanding of the vulnerability class, however, the Jenkins security advisory provides the specific vulnerable actions, and remediation steps. The advisory also includes the affected versions and fixed versions. The impact of this vulnerability is high, as it could allow an attacker to gain significant control over a Jenkins instance. The advisory details specific vulnerabilities identified as SECURITY-412 to SECURITY-420, all grouped under CVE-2017-1000356. The advisory provides more specific details about the different attacks that are possible due to CSRF vulnerabilities.
