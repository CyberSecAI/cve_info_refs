- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The alchemist-server starts a server that executes arbitrary code from any host that can reach it on the network without any authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication and remote code execution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted requests. The example provided shows how to read the server's private SSH key, but any command could be executed.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks. An attacker needs to be able to reach the server via network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server. They don't need to be on the same machine or network if the server is exposed to the public internet.
