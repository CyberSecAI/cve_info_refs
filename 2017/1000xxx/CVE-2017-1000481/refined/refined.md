Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an open redirection issue present in the login form of Plone.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Open Redirection:** The login form does not properly validate or sanitize the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL for redirection after successful login.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker could craft a malicious link that, when clicked, redirects a user to a fake login page after a seemingly legitimate login on the legitimate Plone site. This fake page could be used to steal user credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to a site hosting malware after a legitimate login.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious link with a specially crafted redirect URL.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker distributes the link via phishing emails, social media, or other methods to trick users into clicking it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the vulnerable redirect parameter.
*   The attacker does not need any specific user permissions or access to the target Plone system, other than the ability to send links to potential users.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content specifically mentions "Open redirection on login form", which aligns with the common understanding of this type of vulnerability.
*   The provided content is more descriptive than the generic CVE description, clarifying that the vulnerability is specifically related to the login form, therefore not simply an open redirect on an arbitrary form.
