## **Description**

The Open-EMR web application version 5.0.1-dev and prior is vulnerable to a vertical privilege escalation in at least one place. Exploiting this vulnerability leads to an authenticated user with low privileges (e.g. Front Office) to view and modify information only accessible to administrator users.

The following screenshots shows that it is possible as a user with âFront Officeâ role to view and modify registered users:

If non-administrator users access the following URL, they are able to view all registered users: /openemr/interface/main/tabs/main.php

In addition, a non-administrator user is able to modify information of registered users. The following screenshot show a request made by the user FO with Front Office privileges adding the parameter âauthorizedâ to on:

When verifying with an administrator user, the change has well been applied:
