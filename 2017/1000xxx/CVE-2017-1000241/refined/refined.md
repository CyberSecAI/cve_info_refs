Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the OpenEMR application. Specifically, non-administrator users can access and modify administrative functionalities, indicating a failure to properly enforce privilege levels.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Vertical Privilege Escalation:** The core issue is that users with lower privileges (e.g., Front Office) can access and modify data and functionalities that should be restricted to administrators.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing specific URLs (`/openemr/interface/main/tabs/main.php`, `/openemr/interface/logview/logview.php`, etc.) without proper authorization checks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality Impact:** Low. Non-administrator users can view sensitive information like the list of registered users.
    *   **Integrity Impact:** Low. Non-administrator users can modify user information, including potentially changing authorization levels.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
    *   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers access administrative functionalities by directly navigating to specific URLs within the OpenEMR application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid user of the OpenEMR system, but does not need administrative privileges.
    *   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL paths.
