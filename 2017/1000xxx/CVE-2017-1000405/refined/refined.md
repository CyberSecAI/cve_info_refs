  "CVE-2017-1000405": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2017-1000405",
      "Description": "A flaw was found in the patches used to fix the 'dirtycow' vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195). An attacker, able to run local code, can exploit a race condition in transparent huge pages to modify usually read-only huge pages."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `touch_pmd` function, which incorrectly sets the dirty bit of a Page Medium Directory (PMD) entry without requiring a Copy-On-Write (COW) cycle. This bypasses a fix for the original Dirty COW vulnerability.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Race Condition",
        "Improper Privilege Management",
        "Incorrect dirty bit handling in `touch_pmd`",
		 "Bypass of Copy-On-Write protection"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker with local code execution can exploit this race condition to overwrite read-only huge pages, including the zero page. This can lead to denial of service or unexpected behavior due to modified memory regions used by other processes. In the provided examples, overwriting the huge zero page resulted in application crashes, including Firefox and gdb.",
      "Attack Vector": "Local code execution",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the target system.",
	  "Affected Components": [
		"Linux Kernel",
		"Transparent Huge Pages (THP) subsystem",
		"`touch_pmd` and `touch_pud` functions"
	  ],
     "Affected Configurations": [
        "Systems using Transparent Huge Pages (THP)",
		"Systems with kernel versions containing the incomplete Dirty COW patch"
      ]
    },
    "Additional Information": {
        "Exploit Details": "The provided proof-of-concept code uses a multi-threaded approach to exploit the race condition. It involves mapping a memory region, enabling Transparent Huge Pages, and then racing between writing to the page through `/proc/self/mem` and discarding the COW version of the page using `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`. The vulnerability is triggered when the original read-only page becomes dirty without a COW cycle.",
        "Patch Information": "The fix involves modifying the `touch_pmd` and `touch_pud` functions to set the dirty bit of the PMD/PUD entry only when the caller requests write access (FOLL_WRITE).",
        "Mitigation": "Mitigation includes disabling the use of the zero page, disabling transparent huge pages (THP) or applying the official patch."
