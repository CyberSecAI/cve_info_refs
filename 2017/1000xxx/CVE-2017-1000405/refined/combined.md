##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

The “Dirty COW” vulnerability ([CVE-2016–5195](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5195)) is one of the most hyped and branded vulnerabilities published. Every Linux version from the last decade, including Android, desktops and servers was vulnerable. The impact was vast — millions of users could be compromised easily and reliably, bypassing common exploit defenses.

Plenty of information was published about the vulnerability, but its patch was not analyzed in detail.

We at Bindecy were interested to study the patch and all of its implications. Surprisingly, despite the enormous publicity the bug had received, we discovered that the patch was incomplete.

# “Dirty COW” recap

First, we need a full understanding of the original Dirty COW exploit. We’ll assume basic understanding of the Linux memory manager. We won’t recover the original gory details, as talented people have already [done](https://chao-tic.github.io/blog/2017/05/24/dirty-cow) so.

The original vulnerability was in the `get_user_pages` function. This function is used to get the physical pages behind virtual addresses in user processes. The caller has to specify what kind of actions he intends to perform on these pages (touch, write, lock, etc…), so the memory manager could prepare the pages accordingly. Specifically, when planning to perform a write action on a page inside a private mapping, the page may need to go through a COW (Copy-On-Write) cycle — the original, “read-only” page is copied to a new page which is writable. The original page could be “privileged” — it could be mapped in other processes as well, and might even be written back to the disk after it’s modified.

Let’s now take a look at the relevant code in `__get_user_pages`:

The `while` loop’s goal is to fetch each page in the requested page range. Each page has to be faulted in until our requirements are satisfied — that’s what the `retry` label is used for.

`follow_page_mask`’s role is to scan the page tables to get the physical page for the given address (while taking into account the PTE permissions), or fail in case the request can’t be satisfied. During `follow_page_mask`’s operation the PTE’s spinlock is acquired— this guarantees the physical page won’t be released before we grab a reference.

`faultin_page` requests the memory manager to handle the fault in the given address with the specified permissions (also under the PTE’s spinlock). Note that after a successful call to `faultin_page` the lock is released — it’s not guaranteed that `follow_page_mask` will succeed in the next retry; another piece of code might have messed with our page.

The original vulnerable code resided at the end of `faultin_page`:

The reason for removing the`FOLL_WRITE` flag is to take into account the case the `FOLL_FORCE` flag is applied on a read-only VMA (when the `VM_MAYWRITE` flag is set in the VMA). In that case, the `pte_maybe_mkwrite` function won’t set the write bit, however the faulted-in page is indeed ready for writing.

If the page went through a COW cycle (marked by the `VM_FAULT_WRITE` flag) while performing `faultin_page` and the VMA is not writable, the `FOLL_WRITE` flag is removed from the next attempt to access the page — only read permissions will be requested.

If the first `follow_page_mask` fails because the page was read-only or not present, we’ll try to fault it in. Now let’s imagine that during that time, until the next attempt to get the page, we’ll get rid of the COW version (e.g. by using `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`).

The next call to `faultin_page` will be made without the `FOLL_WRITE` flag, so we’ll get the read-only version of the page from the page cache. Now, the next call to `follow_page_mask` will also happen without the `FOLL_WRITE` flag, so it will return the privileged read-only page — as opposed to the caller’s original request for a writable version of the page.

Basically, the aforementioned flow is the Dirty COW vulnerability — it allows us to write to the read-only privileged version of a page. The following [fix](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=19be0eaffa3ac7d8eb6784ad9bdbc7d67ed8e619) was introduced in `faultin_page`:

And a new function, which is called by `follow_page_mask`, was added:

Instead of reducing the requested permissions, `get_user_pages` now remembers the fact the we went through a COW cycle. On the next iteration, we would be able to get a read-only page for a write operation only if the `FOLL_FORCE` and `FOLL_COW` flags are specified, and that the PTE is marked as dirty.

This patch assumes that the read-only privileged copy of a page will never have a PTE pointing to it with the dirty bit on — a reasonable assumption… or is it?

# Transparent Huge Pages (THP)

Normally, Linux usually uses a 4096-bytes long pages. In order to enable the system to manage large amounts of memory, we can either increase the number of page table entries, or use larger pages. We focus on the second method, which is implemented in Linux by using [huge pages](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/linux-vm-notes/blob/master/sections/trans-huge-pages.md).

A huge page is a 2MB long page. One of the ways to utilize this feature is through the Transparent Huge Pages mechanism. While there are other ways to get huge pages, they are outside of our scope.

The kernel will attempt to satisfy relevant memory allocations using huge pages. THP are swappable and “breakable” (i.e. can be split into normal 4096-bytes pages), and can be used in anonymous, shmem and tmpfs mappings (the latter two are true only in newer kernel versions).

Usually (depending on the compilation flags and the machine configuration) the default THP support is for anonymous mapping only. Shmem and tmpfs support can be turned on manually, and in general THP support can be turned on and off while the system is running by writing to some kernel’s special files.

An important optimization opportunity is to coalesce normal pages into huge pages. A special daemon called khugepaged scans constantly for possible candidate pages that could be merged into huge pages. Obviously, to be a candidate, a VMA must cover a whole, aligned 2MB memory range.

THP is implemented by turning on the `_PAGE_PSE` bit of the PMD (Page Medium Directory, one level above the PTE level). The PMD thus points to a 2MB physical page, instead of a directory of PTEs. Each time the page tables are scanned, the PMDs must be checked with the `pmd_trans_huge` function, so we can decide whether the PMD points to a pfn or a directory of PTEs. On some architectures, huge PUDs (Page Upper Directory) exist as well, resulting in 1GB pages.

THP is supported since kernel 2.6.38. On most Android devices the THP subsystem is not enabled.

# The bug 🐞

Delving into the Dirty COW [patch](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8310d48b125d19fcd9521d83b8293e63eb1646aa) code that deals with THP, we can see that the same logic of `can_follow_write_pte` was applied to huge PMDs. A matching function called `can_follow_write_pmd` was added:

However, in the huge PMD case, a page can be marked dirty without going through a COW cycle, using the `touch_pmd` function:

This function is reached by `follow_page_mask`, which will be called each time `get_user_pages` tries to get a huge page. Obviously, the comment is incorrect and nowadays the dirty bit is NOT meaningless. In particular — when using `get_user_pages` to read a huge page, that page will be marked dirty without going through a COW cycle, and `can_follow_write_pmd`’s logic is now broken.

At this point, exploiting the bug is straightforward — we can use a similar pattern of the original Dirty COW race. This time, after we get rid of the copied version of the page, we have to fault the original page **twice** — first to make it present, and then to turn on the dirty bit.

Now comes the inevitable question — how bad is this?

# Bug implications

In order to exploit the bug, we have to choose an interesting read-only huge page as a target for the writing. The only constraint is that we need to be able to fetch it after it’s discarded with `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`. Anonymous huge pages that were inherited from a parent process after a `fork` are a valuable target, however once they are discarded they are lost for good — we can’t fetch them again.

We found two interesting targets that should not be written into:

* The huge zero page
* Sealed (read-only) huge pages

# The zero page

When issuing a read fault on an anonymous mapping before it was ever written, we get a special physical page called the zero page. This optimization prevents the system from having to allocate multiple zeroed out pages in the system, which might never be written to. Thus, the exact same zero page is mapped in many different processes, which have different security levels.

The same principle applies to huge pages as well — there’s no need to create another huge page if no write fault has occurred yet — a special page called the huge zero page will be mapped, instead. Note that this feature can be turned off as well.

# THP, shmem and sealed files

shmem and [tmpfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt) files can be mapped using THP as well. shmem files can be created using the `[memfd_create](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html)`syscall, or by `mmap`ing anonymous shared mappings. tmpfs files can be created using the mount point of the tmpfs (usually `/dev/shm`). Both can be mapped with huge pages, depending on the system configuration.

shmem files can be sealed — sealing a file restricts the set of operations allowed on the file in question. This mechanism allows processes that don’t trust each other to communicate via shared memory without having to take extra measures to deal with unexpected manipulations of the shared memory region (see `man memfd_create()` for more info). Three types of seals exist -

* `F_SEAL_SHRINK`: file size cannot be reduced
* `F_SEAL_GROW`: file size cannot be increased
* `F_SEAL_WRITE`: file content cannot be modified

These seals can be added to the shmem file using the `fcntl` syscall.

# POC

Our POC demonstrates overwriting the huge zero page. Overwriting shmem should be equally possible and would lead to an alternative exploit path.

Note that after the first write page-fault to the zero page, it will be replaced with a new fresh (and zeroed) THP. Using this primitive, we successfully crash several processes. A likely consequence of overwriting the huge zero page is having improper initial values inside large BSS sections. A common vulnerable pattern would be using the zero value as an indicator that a global variable hasn’t been initialized yet.

The following crash example demonstrates that pattern. In this example, the JS Helper thread of Firefox makes a `NULL`-deref, probably because the boolean pointed by `%rdx` erroneously says the object was initialized:

```

# Summary

This bug demonstrates the importance of patch auditing in the security development life-cycle. As the Dirty COW case and other [past cases](https://sektioneins.de/blog/16-09-05-pegasus-ios-kernel-vulnerability-explained-part-2.html) show, even hyped vulnerabilities may get incomplete patches. The situation is not reserved for closed source software only; open source software suffers just as much.

Feel free to comment with any question or idea about the issue ☺

# Disclosure timeline

The initial report was on the 22.11.17 to the kernel and distros mailing lists. The response was immediate and professional with a [patch](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a8f97366452ed491d13cf1e44241bc0b5740b1f0) ready in a few days. The patch fixes the `touch_pmd` function to set the dirty bit of the PMD entry only when the caller asks for write access.

Thanks to the Security team and the distros for their time and effort of maintaining a high standard of security.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0180)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the patches used to fix the 'dirtycow' vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195). An attacker, able to run local code, can exploit a race condition in transparent huge pages to modify usually read-only huge pages. (CVE-2017-1000405)

Red Hat would like to thank Eylon Ben Yaakov and Daniel Shapiro for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 with the kernel version provided by the kernel-alt package, did not support turning off transactional memory (TM) on the POWER9 systems. With this update it is now possible to turn off TM on the POWER9 systems. (BZ#1509974)
* Due to a bug in the ixgbe and i40e drivers, the socket buffer list (skb list) in some cases got corrupted when running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 with the kernel version provided by the kernel-alt package on the POWER9 systems. Consequently, a kernel panic occurred. This update fixes ixgbe and i40e, and the kernel no longer panics due to this behavior. (BZ#1518412)
* Users can lower the max\_sectors\_kb setting in the sysfs file system to accommodate certain workloads. Previously, users needed to set the maximum I/O size to either the block layer default or the optional preferred I/O size reported by the device. This update fixes the scsi driver to keep the current heuristic function for the initial setting of max\_sectors\_kb. As a result, for subsequent invocations, the driver now only updates the current queue limit if it exceeds the capabilities of the hardware. (BZ#1518432)
* When performing full-bootme tests on Boston ESS systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 with the kernel version provided in the kernel-alt package, a kernel panic occurred and the operating system dropped into the XMON software. This update fixes the Multi-Queue Block IO Queueing Mechanism (blk-mq), and the kernel no longer panics in these circumstances. (BZ#1518433)
* When running the stress test on the file system with the gssstress command, and pulling one disk from one recovery group, "kernel I/O error" was reported, and gssstress became unresponsive. Gssstress now works as expected under the described circumstances. (BZ#1522645)
* When using the fwupdate\_xl710 utility to apply updates for NVM Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter XL710 on machines running Red Hat Enterpise Linux 7.4 with the kernel version provided in the kernel-alt package, a deadlock sometimes occurred when the i40e driver was acquiring access to the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) of the device. Consequently, NVM acquire timeouts occurred, the firmware update failed with the following error message: "Failed Acquiring NVM resource for read err=-53 status=0xa", and left the device's memory in a corrupted state. This update fixes the i40e driver, and the firmware updates no longer fail due to this behavior. (BZ#1522843)
* Previously, on POWER9 systems with more than 100 Pstates, the cpufreq driver did not handle the cases when the NxN matrix denominated transition table (trans\_table) overflowed beyond the PAGE\_SIZE boundary correctly. Consequently, reading trans\_table for any of the CPUs failed with the following error:

"fill\_read\_buffer: show+0x0/0xa0 returned bad count"

With this update reading trans\_table for any of the CPUs now proceeds as expected under the described circumstances. (BZ#1522844)

* Previously, the /sys/firmware/opal/exports directory did not contain an export node. Consequently, a range of memory in the Open Power Abstraction Layer (OPAL) that the operating system attempted to export to user space for debugging purposes was not available. With this update the sysfs file under /sys/firmware/opal/exports is now available for each property found there, and this file can be used for debugging purposes. (BZ#1522845)

mm, thp: Do not make page table dirty unconditionally in touch\_p[mu]d()

```
Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().

We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.

The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1516514#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-11-22 19:34:42 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the patches used to fix the 'dirtycow' vulnerability [CVE-2016-5195](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5195)).  The touch_pmd() function can be accessed by get_user_pages(). In this case, the pmd will become dirty without going through the Copy On Write cycle.   In the simplest example, a large page that is read-only can be modified, including page 0 of a processes virtual address space.

They do not contain the upstream commit (8310d48b125d19fcd9521d83b8293e63eb1646aa) which allows the race condition.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM and Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Power LE.  Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases may address this issue.  For further information please refer to the vulnerability article in the Customer Portal: <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/3253921>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1516514#c7)  Wade Mealing    2017-11-29 05:43:58 UTC  ``` What is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM,         Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Power LE,         and kernel-alt:  The kernel-alt package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM and Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Power LE is an updated kernel intended to support new architectures not available at the time of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 original shipping. The new kernel version provided by the kernel-alt packages is based on upstream version 4.11 . The offering is distributed with other updated packages but most of the userspace is the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server RPMs.  For more information please refer to:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3158541> <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3158511>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1516514#c8)  Wade Mealing    2017-11-29 07:28:32 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Disabling the use of zero page:   It is possible to prevent the zero page from being mapped as a huge page, by modifying a configuration tunable in the /sys directory as shown below.  This prevents the flaw from being exercised in this method.  #  echo 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/use_zero_page   Disabling huge pages:  It is possible to mitigate this flaw by disabling hugepages on a system.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security patch levels of 2018-02-05 or later address all issues associated with
the 2018-02-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels. To learn how
to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on the
[Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

**2. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**3. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**4. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the
[Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**5. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and the
Android Security Bulletins?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in the Android Security Bulletins
are required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities, such as those documented in this
bulletin, are not required for declaring a security patch level.
