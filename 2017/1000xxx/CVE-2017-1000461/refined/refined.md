The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1000461.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the ability to bypass fingerprinting protections implemented in the Brave browser. These protections typically involve removing references to certain methods from the global object. However, an attacker can obtain alternate references to the same methods by creating an iframe and accessing them through `iframe.contentWindow` or `iframe.contentDocument`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of effective isolation for sensitive methods across different window contexts (main frame vs. iframes).  The browser's fingerprinting protections are circumvented because the iframe's context provides access to the original, unblocked methods that are otherwise hidden in the main frame.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access fingerprinting-related methods, such as `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.toDataURL`, even when these methods are supposed to be blocked or unavailable. This enables advanced fingerprinting techniques to track users across the web, undermining the privacy protections Brave aims to provide.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting an iframe into the web page. The attacker loads any page into the iframe (the example uses `https://www.brave.com/`), and then uses the `contentWindow` or `contentDocument` property of the iframe element to obtain references to methods that the browser is attempting to block in the parent frame.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to inject Javascript code into a webpage loaded in a Brave browser instance. This can be done either through a malicious web page or by exploiting a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on a trusted website.
