Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-1000037:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in how RVM (Ruby Version Manager) automatically loads environment variables and executes hooks when a user changes directories using the `cd` command. Specifically, RVM parses configuration files within the current working directory ($PWD) and performs actions based on their content. These actions include setting environment variables, executing hooks, and installing gems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Environment Variable Loading:** RVM loads environment variables from files such as `.versions.conf`, `Gemfile`, `.ruby-version`, and `.ruby-env` without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into environment variables, which are then evaluated by the shell using `eval`, leading to command execution.
*   **Command Injection:** The code that parses environment variables fails to properly escape backslashes before using them in an `eval` statement. This leads to command injection, where an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Automatic Execution of Hooks:** RVM automatically executes hooks located in both `~/.rvm/hooks` and `$PWD/.rvm/hooks` when a user changes directories. This allows an attacker to place malicious hook scripts in a directory and have them executed when a user `cd`s into it.
*  **Automatic Gem Installation:** RVM automatically parses the `.versions.conf` file, allowing the specification of arbitrary gems to be installed using `gem install`. This can be leveraged by an attacker to install a malicious gem that contains a `post_install` hook to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Automatic `bundle install`:** RVM automatically executes `bundle install` based on the content of the `.versions.conf` file. An error in the logic allows this to happen regardless of user settings. Because Gemfiles are interpreted with Ruby, a malicious Gemfile can be used for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary command execution within the context of the user who changes directories into a malicious folder. This can lead to:

*   **Data breaches:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data.
*   **System compromise:** An attacker could take over the system or disrupt normal operations.
*   **Malware installation:** An attacker could install malware on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Directories:** An attacker can create malicious files (e.g., `.versions.conf`, hook scripts, malicious gems, Gemfiles) within a directory they control on a multi-user system. Then, they could convince the user to `cd` into that directory, triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Archives/Tarballs:** An attacker can create a malicious archive containing the above malicious files that a user could be tricked into extracting to a location and then `cd` into it.
*   **Compromised Git Repositories:** An attacker can create a malicious Git repository which a user would clone and then `cd` into.
*   **Web Application Exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious files via a web application that they control, and wait for an administrator to `cd` into the directory that the files are uploaded to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create files:** The attacker must be able to create files in a location that the victim user is likely to access.
*   **Social engineering (or automated mechanism):** The attacker needs to convince or force the victim user to use `cd` to enter a directory containing malicious files.
