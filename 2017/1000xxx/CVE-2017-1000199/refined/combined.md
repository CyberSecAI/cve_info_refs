| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1487252#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-08-31 13:47:58 UTC  ```  A local non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus can call the CheckConfig method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon via handler_qcow.so and exploit an information leak by passing in arbitrary filenames to check.  This allows a local user to check for the existence of root owned files, which might enable more serious security issues in combination with other security flaws in a system.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Security information leak in internal qcow handler's check\_config callback #194

## Description

[![@mgerstner](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24227799?v=4&size=48)](/mgerstner)[mgerstner](https://github.com/mgerstner)opened [on Jul 14, 2017](https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/issues/194#issue-243036210)

The implementation of `qcow_check_config` presents an information leak, because it allows any user with access to the dbus system bus to check for the existance of files and directories, even if the user shouldn't have access to those files.

For example issuing this command as a regular user allows to get the knowledge, whether */root/.bash\_history* exists:

```
dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.kernel.TCMUService1 /org/kernel/TCMUService1/qcow org.kernel.TCMUService1.CheckConfig string://root/.bash_history

```

These kind of information leaks in combination with other security issues often leverage more serious security issues.

I'd have suggested a bugfix for this but it is difficult to get right. If we knew the peer credentials from dbus we could do a comparison of those credentials against the target file credentials. This still would be difficult for corner cases, where the file itself would be accessible to the user, but not some of the upper components of the path.

The `check_config` callback does currently not provide a possibility to pass peer credential information in, so this would affect public API in some way. Also I've not found a simple way to get the dbus peer credentials via libgio, maybe by using a `GDBusAuthObserver`.

All quite complicated, might be easier to drop this config callback altogether.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A3277)

## Topic

An update for tcmu-runner is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The tcmu-runner packages provide a service that handles the complexity of the LIO kernel target's userspace passthrough interface (TCMU). It presents a C plugin API for extension modules that handle SCSI requests in ways not possible or suitable to be handled by LIO's in-kernel backstores.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the implementation of CheckConfig method in handler\_glfs.so of the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could send a specially crafted string to CheckConfig method resulting in various kinds of segmentation fault. (CVE-2017-1000198)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the UnregisterHandler method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could call the UnregisterHandler method with the name of a handler loaded internally in tcmu-runner via dlopen() to trigger DoS. (CVE-2017-1000200)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the UnregisterHandler method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could call UnregisterHandler method with non-existing tcmu handler as paramater to trigger DoS. (CVE-2017-1000201)
* A file information leak flaw was found in implementation of the CheckConfig method in handler\_qcow.so of the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could use this flaw to leak arbitrary file names which might not be retrievable by non-root user. (CVE-2017-1000199)
