Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-1000199:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `CheckConfig` method within the `handler_qcow.so` module of the `tcmu-runner` daemon was implemented without proper access control checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Leak:** The `CheckConfig` method allowed any user with access to the D-Bus system bus to query the existence of arbitrary files and directories, even if they did not have the necessary permissions to access them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** Attackers could use this vulnerability to determine the presence of sensitive files on the system, such as configuration files or user data. This information leak could then potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities for more serious attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** The vulnerability was exploitable by local users with access to the system's D-Bus.
- **D-Bus interaction:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted message to the `CheckConfig` D-Bus method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local, non-root user:** The attacker needs to be a local, non-root user.
- **Access to the D-Bus system bus:** The attacker needs access to the D-Bus system bus to send the crafted message.
- **No special permissions required:** No elevated privileges or complex setup was required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `handler_qcow.so` module.
- The `CheckConfig` method lacked the proper peer credential checks, which would have compared the user's access rights against the target file's permissions.
- The vulnerability could expose file names that are not normally accessible to non-root users.
- The upstream patch for this vulnerability is available at: `https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/commit/8cf8208775022301adaa59c240bb7f93742d1329`
- This issue was addressed in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 for RHEL 7 via RHSA-2017:3277.
