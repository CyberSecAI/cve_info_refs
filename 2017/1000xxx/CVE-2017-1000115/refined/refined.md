  "CVE-2017-1000115": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Mercurial: pathaudit: path traversal via symlink",
    "details": "A vulnerability was found in the way Mercurial handles path auditing and caches the results. An attacker could abuse a repository with a series of commits mixing symlinks and regular files/directories to trick Mercurial into writing outside of a given repository. The symlink auditor is sometimes cached too long, and can be confused into allowing write access to outside the repo.",
    "affected_versions": "< 4.3",
    "fixed_versions": ">= 4.3, mercurial 4.3, mercurial 4.2.3",
     "root_cause": "Incomplete symlink auditing and caching in Mercurial.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient validation of symlink paths",
       "Caching of symlink audit results allows bypassing security checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could trick Mercurial into writing files outside of a given repository, potentially leading to arbitrary file write or overwrite.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Malicious repository with crafted commits that contain symlinks and regular files/directories"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Mercurial repository to include malicious commits. No special position or privilege is needed other than ability to create a repository or have write access to a repository.",
