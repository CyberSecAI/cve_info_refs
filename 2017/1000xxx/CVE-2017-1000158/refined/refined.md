(CVE) ID: CVE-2017-1000158
```
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000158:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `PyBytes_DecodeEscape` (or `PyString_DecodeEscape` in older Python versions) function within Python's C implementation (CPython).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates the required buffer size using multiplication which, when given large enough input, can lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a small buffer being allocated.
- **Heap Corruption:**  This small buffer is then written to with a potentially larger amount of data, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, causing heap corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Heap corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain full control of a system by exploiting this overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when parsing strings with escaped characters, especially with large strings when a non-default encoding is used.
- The specific vulnerable functions are `PyString_DecodeEscape` (Python 2.7) and `PyBytes_DecodeEscape` (Python 3.x).
- This function can be indirectly called through the `parsestr` function in `ast.c` when parsing a Python file with a non-UTF-8 or non-ISO-8859-1 encoding. This makes the vulnerability accessible by simply loading a specially crafted python file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to either provide a malicious python file to be parsed or influence a program that parses strings with escaped character in a way that triggers the overflow
-  The vulnerability is most reliably exploitable in 32-bit Python builds, where the integer overflow is easier to achieve (a string in the order of 1GB will trigger the vulnerability)

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered "minor" or "unlikely" to be triggered in real-world scenarios, but is still considered a security risk and is fixed across affected versions.
- The vulnerability exists in Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.
- The provided information includes details of the fix involving an added check for integer overflows before performing the multiplication. This is present in the `Objects/bytesobject.c` and `Objects/stringobject.c` source files in CPython.
- The fix is to check for potential integer overflow before allocating a buffer, preventing the heap overflow from occurring.
- The vulnerability can be triggered in 32-bit systems.
- There's mention of a PoC generator and that a very long time to load the PoC file.
- The vulnerability is not present in python 3.6+ since the code was rewritten.
- NetApp products were also affected by this vulnerability but it was determined that they are not vulnerable.
