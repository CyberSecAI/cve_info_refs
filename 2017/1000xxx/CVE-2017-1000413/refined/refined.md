{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the implementation of the RSA algorithm within the LibTomCrypt library used by OP-TEE. Specifically, the original Left-to-Right (LtoR) algorithm used for modular exponentiation in `mpa_exp_mod()` was susceptible to timing attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability in the RSA modular exponentiation implementation.",
      "RSA key leakage due to side-channel and fault injection attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could lead to the leakage of RSA private keys. This would allow an attacker to impersonate the legitimate owner of the key, decrypt sensitive data, or forge signatures.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Side-channel timing attacks analyzing the execution time of RSA operations.",
      "Fault injection attacks targeting the RSA algorithm."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to observe or manipulate the timing of RSA operations and potentially inject faults during computation. This could be achieved through physical access or by exploiting other software vulnerabilities that allow for such observation or manipulation."

      "commit": "c53ec7708e6f97fabc4a532a48d6099f1202d913",
      "description": "Removes the `LTC_LINARO_FIX_RSAWITHOUTCRT` flag and related code as the issue is fixed upstream in LibTomCrypt."

      "commit": "d086014de4e46c9a37b5fd228e71e9861e93cd09",
      "description": "Implements `mp_rand()` for the `mpa_desc` descriptor, resolving the issue that occurs when the `LTC_RSA_BLINDING` flag is enabled. This fixes OP-TEE-2016-0003 related to RSA key leakage after fault injection."

      "commit": "e23868cfaab904ffaa9138adfe727fdb502935c8",
     "description": "Enables `RSA_CRT_HARDENING` and `RSA_CRT_BLINDING` flags by default to enhance robustness against the Bellcore attack when using RSA with CRT. This fixes OP-TEE-2016-0003 related to RSA key leakage after fault injection."
