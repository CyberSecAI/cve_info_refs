{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The stack guard-page mechanism, designed to prevent stack overflows from clashing with other memory regions, can be bypassed by various methods. These methods include allocating memory such that the stack clashes with another memory region, then moving the stack pointer over the guard page, and finally smashing either the stack or the other memory region.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient stack guard-page size, allowing stack pointer to jump over it.",
    "Vulnerabilities in stack guard-page implementations (OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD).",
    "Kernel limitations on argument and environment string sizes are only imposed on the strings themselves, not the pointers.",
    "Recursive qsort() implementation allowing excessive stack consumption.",
      "Incorrect implementation of setrlimit() leading to unauthorized memory protection changes.",
     "Flaws in how the dynamic linker handles environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH allowing manipulation and code execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root, arbitrary code execution, data corruption, and potential remote code execution in certain scenarios.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Command-line arguments and environment variables.",
    "Recursive function calls (e.g., qsort()).",
    "Exploiting vulnerabilities in glibc functions (__dcigettext(), vfprintf(), getaddrinfo()).",
    "Manipulation of LD_LIBRARY_PATH using Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs).",
    "Exploiting vulnerabilities in Sudo's get_process_ttyname() function",
    "Using hard-links to bypass Forced-Privilege protections (Solaris)",
        "Manipulating the RLIMIT_STACK value on some OSes"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system is generally required. Some attacks can be triggered remotely if a vulnerable service is exposed and re-execve() is performed after the initial connection. In some instances, an attacker may also need to be able to write files to specific directories."
