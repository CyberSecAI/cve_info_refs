Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000106:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Blue Ocean plugin's SCM content REST API did not properly check the current user's authentication or credentials when creating or editing pipelines in GitHub organization folders.
*   When a GitHub organization folder was created via Blue Ocean, it retained a reference to its creatorâ€™s GitHub credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication/Authorization:** The SCM content REST API lacked proper authentication and authorization checks.
*   **Credential Leakage/Misuse:** The plugin stored and used the creator's GitHub credentials instead of the current user's credentials for operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Commit Creation:** Users with read access to the GitHub organization folder could create arbitrary commits in repositories within the organization, using the creator's credentials.
*   **Arbitrary File Content Read:** Users with read access could read arbitrary file contents from repositories if the branch contained a Jenkinsfile, by providing the organization folder name, repository name, branch name, and file name.
*   **Potential for Supply Chain Attacks:** Malicious users could insert backdoors/malware into repositories due to the ability to commit arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible via the network through the Blue Ocean SCM content REST API.
*   **Blue Ocean Interface:** An attacker would need to access the Blue Ocean interface and target the vulnerable REST API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Jenkins Access:** The attacker needs to have read access to a GitHub organization folder within Jenkins that was created using Blue Ocean.
*   **Understanding of the REST API:** The attacker needs to know how to use the SCM content REST API.
*   **Knowledge of target repository:** Attacker needs to know the name of the target repository, branch and filename in order to read arbitrary files.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affects pipelines created for Bitbucket Cloud and Server as well.
*   The issue was present in Blue Ocean 1.1.5 and 1.2.0 beta releases up to and including 1.2.0-beta-3.
*   The fix limits SCM content REST API access to authenticated users and uses the authenticated user's credentials.

This vulnerability could allow unauthorized users to modify source code and potentially gain further access into the GitHub organizations.
