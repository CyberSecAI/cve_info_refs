- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2` function in Phoenix framework did not properly sanitize user-provided URLs used in redirects. Specifically, it allowed newlines (`\n`) within the URL which, when parsed by browsers like Chrome and Firefox, could be interpreted as an external URL instead of a local path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation, specifically not sanitizing user-provided URLs for newline characters which can be interpreted as a different protocol by browsers. This leads to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing newlines that appears to be a local redirect but is actually an external redirect. This allows them to redirect users to an attacker-controlled domain, typically for phishing attacks, social engineering or other malicious purposes.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker provides a crafted URL as user input to the vulnerable `Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2` function. The crafted URL includes newlines.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply user input to an application that uses the vulnerable `Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2` function. They also need a target that uses a vulnerable browser.
