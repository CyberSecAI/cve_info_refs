  "cveId": "CVE-2017-1000370",
  "description": "The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument or environment list can result in ASLR bypass for 32-bit PIE binaries.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Linux kernel's limitation on the size of command-line arguments and environment variables, which is 1/4 of the RLIMIT_STACK. However, this limit is applied to the strings themselves, not the argv[] and envp[] pointers to these strings. By allocating a large number of these pointers, the stack can be expanded to overlap with the PIE binary's address space.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of the number of argument and environment pointers",
	  "ASLR bypass due to predictable mapping of PIE binaries when stack is inflated"
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass ASLR for 32-bit PIE binaries, making them easier to exploit.",
     "attackVectors": [
      "Local exploitation via manipulation of argument and environment lists during program execution"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute a program with a large number of command-line arguments or environment variables on a vulnerable system."
  },
  "additionalNotes": [
    "The vulnerability is triggered when the PIE binary is executed with a large number of arguments or environment strings, which cause the stack to grow and overlap with the PIE's address space.",
    "This vulnerability can nullify the offset2lib patch introduced in Linux Kernel.",
	"The issue is specific to 32-bit PIE binaries."
