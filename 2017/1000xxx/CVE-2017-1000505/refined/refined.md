Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2017-1000505:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A type coercion feature in Groovy allowed the creation of new `File` objects from strings within sandboxed Groovy and Pipeline scripts. This bypasses the intended restrictions of the sandbox environment.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sandbox bypass:** The Groovy type coercion mechanism was not properly restricted by the Script Security Plugin's sandbox, enabling access to sensitive functionalities.
- **Unrestricted file access:** The ability to create `File` objects from strings allowed reading arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file read:** Attackers could read any file accessible to the Jenkins controller process. This may include configuration files, credentials, and source code, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Script execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the configuration of sandboxed Groovy and Pipeline scripts (including those from SCM).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to configure sandboxed Groovy or Pipeline scripts. This could involve having permissions to configure jobs, or potentially through a compromised SCM.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-663.
- The fix involves subjecting the type coercion to sandbox protection by considering it to be a call to the `new File(String)` constructor for in-process script approval.
- The provided text also specifies that the vulnerability affects versions of the Script Security Plugin up to and including 1.36, and it is fixed in version 1.37.
