The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Dolibarr.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's XSS detection mechanism fails to identify a specific payload when modifying the name of a product, allowing it to be saved in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Stored XSS vulnerability
  - Insufficient input validation/sanitization of the product name field
  - Inadequate XSS detection mechanism

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected product page.
  - Potential for session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
  - An attacker with the ability to edit product names can inject malicious JavaScript code into the product name.
  - When other users view the product page, the stored XSS payload will execute in their browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Must have a user account with permissions to modify product names in Dolibarr.
  - Basic understanding of XSS payloads and how to bypass filters.
