## Description

[![@prodigysml](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16996819?u=8ac045207384ce660425a4fdded4a836e20988a2&v=4&size=48)](/prodigysml)[prodigysml](https://github.com/prodigysml)opened [on Oct 27, 2017](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/issues/7727#issue-269249135)
# Bug

Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) using product page, bypassing XSS detection

## Environment

* **Version**: 6.0.2
* **OS**: Ubuntu
* **Web server**: Apache
* **PHP**: 7.0
* **Database**: MySQL
* **URL(s)**: `product/card.php?id=1929&mainmenu=home`

## Expected and actual behavior

### Expected behaviour

XSS detector picks up on the payload and refuses to save it

### Actual behaviour

XSS payload is saved with no interference from the detector. When visiting the page later, the payload executes.

## Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. Log into Dolibarr with a user who can edit the name of a product
2. Choose a product (this products name will be changed FYI), and click on the modify details button
3. Append the following payload to the product's current name: `<iframe/src="data:text/html;&Tab;base64&Tab;,PGJvZHkgb25sb2FkPWFsZXJ0KDEpPg==">`

## Suggested implementation

Change the detector to now pick up on similar payloads (including this one)
