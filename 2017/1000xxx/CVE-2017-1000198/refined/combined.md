| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1487252#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-08-31 13:47:58 UTC  ```  A local non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus can call the CheckConfig method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon via handler_qcow.so and exploit an information leak by passing in arbitrary filenames to check.  This allows a local user to check for the existence of root owned files, which might enable more serious security issues in combination with other security flaws in a system.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/commit/8cf8208775022301adaa59c240bb7f93742d1329>  References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q3/207>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1487252#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-08-31 13:50:07 UTC  ``` Created tcmu-runner tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1487255](show_bug.cgi?id=1487255 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-1000198 CVE-2017-1000199 CVE-2017-1000200 CVE-2017-1000201 tcmu-runner: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1487252#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-29 03:33:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:3277 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3277](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3277)   ``` |  |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A3277)

## Topic

An update for tcmu-runner is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The tcmu-runner packages provide a service that handles the complexity of the LIO kernel target's userspace passthrough interface (TCMU). It presents a C plugin API for extension modules that handle SCSI requests in ways not possible or suitable to be handled by LIO's in-kernel backstores.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the implementation of CheckConfig method in handler\_glfs.so of the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could send a specially crafted string to CheckConfig method resulting in various kinds of segmentation fault. (CVE-2017-1000198)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the UnregisterHandler method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could call the UnregisterHandler method with the name of a handler loaded internally in tcmu-runner via dlopen() to trigger DoS. (CVE-2017-1000200)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the UnregisterHandler method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could call UnregisterHandler method with non-existing tcmu handler as paramater to trigger DoS. (CVE-2017-1000201)
* A file information leak flaw was found in implementation of the CheckConfig method in handler\_qcow.so of the tcmu-runner daemon. A local, non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus could use this flaw to leak arbitrary file names which might not be retrievable by non-root user. (CVE-2017-1000199)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1487246#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-08-31 13:41:00 UTC  ```  A local non-root user with access to the D-Bus system bus can call the CheckConfig method implemented in the tcmu-runner daemon via handler_glfs.so and cause various kinds of segmentation faults, depending on the string passed to the method.  For example the "hosts" variable in glfs_check_config() is not zero initialized, but always freed on error, causing invalid free and/or invalid memory accesses.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/commit/61bd03e600d2abf309173e9186f4d465bb1b7157>  References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q3/207>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1487246#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-08-31 13:50:24 UTC  ``` Created tcmu-runner tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1487255](show_bug.cgi?id=1487255 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-1000198 CVE-2017-1000199 CVE-2017-1000200 CVE-2017-1000201 tcmu-runner: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1487246#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-29 03:33:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:3277 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3277](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3277)   ``` |  |
