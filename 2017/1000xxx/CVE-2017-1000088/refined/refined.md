The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, and this response focuses on the one related to CVE-2017-1000088.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sidebar Link plugin did not perform input validation on the URLs provided for sidebar links. This allowed users to use `javascript:` schemes, resulting in a persisted Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persisted XSS:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored and executed when other users view the affected pages.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin did not validate the URL scheme allowing `javascript:` URLs to be used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they visit affected pages (jobs, views, and agents).
- This could lead to the theft of session cookies, modification of page content, or redirection to malicious websites.
- The attacker can use this to potentially compromise other user's accounts or inject arbitrary content into the Jenkins UI.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user with the permission to configure jobs, views or agents can add a crafted sidebar link containing malicious JavaScript using the `javascript:` URL scheme.
- When another user views the page with the malicious link, the injected JavaScript will execute within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have permission to configure jobs, views, or agents.
- They must be able to add or modify sidebar links.
