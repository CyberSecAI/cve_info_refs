    {
      "type": "vulnerability",
      "content": "The provided text discusses a research project named 'sim set' that uses symbolic execution to identify semantic problems in x.509 certificate validation in TLS libraries. It does not mention a specific vulnerability with a CVE ID.",
      "root_cause": "Non-compliance with the X.509 standard in TLS libraries.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Misinterpretation of the 2-byte year of UTC time.",
        "Using lax comparison logic when matching extended key usage object identifiers.",
        "Ignoring country, state, and locality attributes in subject and issuer names.",
        "Ineffective sanity checks.",
	"Hidden coding mistakes in parsing code.",
	"Overly restrictive time checks.",
	"Not checking path length constraints."
      ],
      "impact": "Overly permissive implementations can lead to various attacks while overly restrictive ones can result in loss of service. This could result in the acceptance of invalid certificates or the rejection of valid certificates.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "Impersonation attacks.",
	"Acceptance of expired certificates"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to craft malicious certificates that exploit the weaknesses in the library's validation logic. They would need to have control over the certificate presented to a vulnerable client."
