## Description

[![@obi1kenobi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2348618?u=9cda9b2935a3dafd380af0386a7be1998d7132aa&v=4&size=48)](/obi1kenobi)[obi1kenobi](https://github.com/obi1kenobi)opened [on May 24, 2017](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/issues/417#issue-231078057)

The [Server](https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/blob/4375361939e942c4dd666d3ca4e1159858404bc4/src/saml2/server.py#L91) class randomly generates a fixed 16-byte initialization vector (IV) for the purpose of encrypting data. Then, via the [UsernamePasswordMako](https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/blob/4375361939e942c4dd666d3ca4e1159858404bc4/src/saml2/authn.py#L123) class, that fixed IV makes its way to the `AESCipher` class, where it is consistently reused for encrypting data.

Initialization vector reuse like this is a security concern, since it leaks information about the encrypted data to attackers, regardless of the encryption mode used. For example, if the IV is reused with the same key in AES-CTR mode, the attacker will very likely be able to entirely decrypt the encrypted data: <https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2991/why-must-iv-key-pairs-not-be-reused-in-ctr-mode>

Instead of relying on a fixed, randomly-generated IV, it would be better to randomly-generate a new IV for every encryption operation. Here are a couple of links that have more information on why that is the preferred approach:
