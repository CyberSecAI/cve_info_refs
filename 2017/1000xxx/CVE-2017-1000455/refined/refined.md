{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'activate-setuid-programs' function in GuixSD's (gnu build activation) would create setuid-root binaries in /gnu/store for programs listed under 'setuid-programs' in the operating-system declaration. This function created a hard link or copy of the program to /run/setuid-programs/ and then set the setuid bit on both the copy in /run/setuid-programs and the original program in /gnu/store.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that setuid binaries were created directly within the /gnu/store directory. This allows users to potentially execute older, vulnerable versions of setuid programs if a previous OS generation included them. The program in the /gnu/store retained the setuid permissions",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could potentially run older, vulnerable setuid programs from previous OS generations, possibly exploiting known vulnerabilities in those programs to gain elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required. An attacker would need to be a user on the GuixSD system and have knowledge of or the ability to find previously setuid programs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a local user on a GuixSD system, and have the ability to execute commands."
