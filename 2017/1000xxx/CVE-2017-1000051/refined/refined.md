Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000051:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper HTML escaping within the CryptPad application. Specifically, multiple areas were identified where user-supplied data was not correctly sanitized before being displayed in the browser, leading to XSS vulnerabilities. The application's reliance on proper escaping, instead of a layered security approach, resulted in exploitable flaws.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities were present due to inadequate HTML escaping.
- The application had a Content Security Policy (CSP) in place but made an exception for inline scripts due to CKEditor's usage. This exception weakened the CSP and allowed the XSS vulnerabilities to be exploited.
-  A pad export vulnerability, as well as an XSS issue within the userlist.
- Alertify.js was not handling user input securely, potentially exposing XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- Given that CryptPad stores encryption keys in the browser, a successful XSS attack could potentially grant an attacker access to all of the victim's pads (documents).

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into various parts of the application where user input was not properly sanitized. This includes, but is not limited to, pad content, userlist, or other input fields.
- An export feature was also vulnerable, which could allow an attacker to inject XSS when a pad is exported and later viewed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input into the CryptPad application. This could potentially be done through various means, such as creating or editing a pad, interacting with user lists, or other input mechanisms.
-  No special position is required, as the injection can be achieved through standard web app functionalities.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Martin Gubri.
- CryptPad developers have released version 1.1.1 to patch these vulnerabilities which implemented a stronger Content Security Policy everywhere except the CKEditor iframe, in addition to sanitizing the XSS issues.
-  CryptPad also implemented a new bootloader script to be compatible with CSP headers, which loads scripts and forcefully overrides browser caching issues.
-  Alertify.js now validates input with a 'force' flag to overwrite the default behavior.
- The developers are also considering sandboxing each app into an iframe, to isolate them from each other and protect cryptographic keys.
