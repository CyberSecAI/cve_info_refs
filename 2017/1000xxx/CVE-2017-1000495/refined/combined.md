# Issue

Any user can execute JavaScript code on an administrator user's account by simply changing their name into an XSS payload. This can be used to create a denial of service condition, or make the administrator perform unauthorised actions.

# Steps to reproduce

1. Create a user with the lowest privileges
2. Navigate to the 'My Account' section of the application
3. Change the user's real name to a JavaScript payload, like `asdf<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
4. Log out of the account.
5. Log into an administrator account
6. Navigate to the user list in the administrator's console
7. Observe an alert box appear
