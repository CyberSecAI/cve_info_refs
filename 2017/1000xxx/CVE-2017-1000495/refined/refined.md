The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1000495.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying user names in the administrator panel. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or encode HTML special characters within the "real name" field when displaying them on the user list.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an administrator's browser session.
- This could be used to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the administrator (e.g., modifying data, adding new users, escalating privileges).
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by repeatedly triggering malicious JavaScript.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting an XSS payload in the "real name" field, a low-privilege user can trigger the vulnerability when an administrator views the user list.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs an account with the application.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to edit their "real name" or similar user profile fields
- The attacker needs to convince an administrator to view a list of users that includes the attacker.
