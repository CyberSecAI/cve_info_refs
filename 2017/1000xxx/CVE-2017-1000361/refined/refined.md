    "related": true,
    "summary": "This document discusses security testing of SDN controllers using fuzzing techniques, focusing on OpenFlow implementations in OpenDaylight and ONOS. It details discovered vulnerabilities including denial of service flaws and implementation bugs.",

      {
        "vulnerability": "Denial of Service (DoS) in OpenDaylight",
        "description": "A vulnerability where the controller crashes due to an excessive number of threads created. This occurs when a malicious switch sends many OpenFlow hello packets but does not receive any data from the controller. The thread managing the connection doesn't terminate, leading to an exponential thread growth and eventual crash.",
          "impact": "Controller crashes leading to unavailability of network control.",
        "attack_vector": "Malicious switch sends many OpenFlow Hello packets without proper handling of response.",
        "capabilities": "Attacker controls or compromises a network switch.",
        "weaknesses": "Improper thread management and resource handling within the controller.",
          "remediation": "Increase java heap memory."

        "vulnerability": "DoS in adding flows in OpenDaylight",

        "impact": "Legitimate applications are unable to add flows to the switch, impairing network control until restart.",
        "attack_vector": "Malicious switch or network application send multiple duplicate REST API requests to add the same flow",
        "capabilities": "Attacker needs to send REST API requests to add flows on the controller.",
         "weaknesses":"Improper handling of duplicate flow addition requests.",

        "vulnerability": "DoS in OpenDaylight odl-mdsal-xsql",
         "description": "This component is vulnerable to several denial of service attacks. These vulnerabilites involve sending crafted strings to specific ports, resulting in Java out of memory errors and increased CPU consumption. ",
