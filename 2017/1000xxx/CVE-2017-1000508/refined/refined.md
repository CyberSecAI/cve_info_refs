The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1000508.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient output sanitization of client email and web address fields. Specifically, the application was not properly escaping these fields before displaying them in the client view, which resulted in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the client's email or web address fields.
- When an administrator or other user views the client details, the malicious script would execute in their browser. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the application interface
    - Potentially gain access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject the malicious code by manipulating the client's email or web address fields via the application interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify client data. This would require either having an account with sufficient privileges or somehow exploiting another vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to client data management functionalities.
