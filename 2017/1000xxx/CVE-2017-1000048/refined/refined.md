  "CVE-2017-1000048": {
    "description": "The qs module for Node.js is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays with a depth limit. It was found that ljharb's qs module for Node.js did not properly parse query strings. An attacker could send a specially crafted query that overwrites the resulting object's prototype properties (such as toString() or hasOwnProperty()), resulting in a denial of service when the overwritten function would be executed.",
    "root_cause": "Improper parsing of query strings in the qs module for Node.js.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Prototype pollution/override vulnerability",
	  "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could overwrite prototype properties, leading to a denial-of-service when the overwritten function is executed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted query strings"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send a crafted query string to a system using the vulnerable qs library.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by prefixing the name of the parameter with `[` or `]` (e.g. `qs.parse(\"]=toString\")`)"
