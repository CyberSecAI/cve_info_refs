Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure parsing of XML files by LogicalDOC. Specifically, the XML parser is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The application processes uploaded XML files without properly sanitizing or disabling external entity resolution. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code that can force the parser to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the XXE vulnerability to read sensitive files from the server's filesystem. In the specific example provided, the attacker was able to read `/etc/passwd`. This can lead to the disclosure of system user information, application configuration files, and potentially database credentials. If the platform uses an integrated SQL database, the attacker could obtain logs of SQL statements, including password hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user uploads a specially crafted XML file to the application. The application attempts to parse the file for indexing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the LogicalDOC application. Even a user with the lowest level of privileges (guest account) can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The blog post describes the vulnerability in greater detail than the typical CVE description, explaining how the content of the accessed file is included in the indexing results, enabling the attacker to search for specific content and retrieve information.
- The blog post mentions that LogicalDOC was running as root on their test system, which amplified the impact of this vulnerability, since the attacker could read any file accessible to the root user.
