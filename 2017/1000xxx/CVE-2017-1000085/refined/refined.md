The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000085.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Subversion Plugin did not properly check permissions when connecting to a user-specified Subversion repository during form validation. This allowed users with Item/Build permission (but not Item/Configure) to initiate a connection to any server and send credentials with a known ID. Additionally, the functionality did not enforce POST requests, allowing for CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient permission checks.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to lack of POST request enforcement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential capture of credentials by sending them to a malicious server.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A user with Item/Build permission can send credentials to an arbitrary server.
-  CSRF attacks can be used to trigger this vulnerability without direct access to Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a user account with Item/Build permissions in Jenkins.
- For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a form.
