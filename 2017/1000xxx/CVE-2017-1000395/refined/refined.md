- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jenkins "User" remote API at `/user/(username)/api` was disclosing sensitive information about users, specifically email addresses, to any user with Overall/Read permissions. This occurred due to the API providing more information than necessary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability, specifically exposing email addresses of Jenkins users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can obtain email addresses of Jenkins users, potentially leading to targeted phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, accessing the vulnerable API endpoint `/user/(username)/api`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins instance.
