Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000102:

**CVE-2017-1000102:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The "Details" view of plugins based on the Static Analysis Utilities Plugin was vulnerable to a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This was due to the plugin not sanitizing user-influenced input when rendering the "Details" view.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin failed to sanitize HTML, allowing malicious users to inject arbitrary HTML into the "Details" view.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the plugin's output. This could lead to various attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Defacing the Jenkins interface
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious users could inject arbitrary HTML through input to the Static Analysis Utilities plugin
    *   One example given is influencing console output which is parsed to extract build warnings
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the Static Analysis Utilities Plugin. For example, they need to be able to control parts of the console output which is then parsed and used in the details view.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability was addressed by sanitizing HTML to a safe subset in all messages on the Details view.
*   The same vulnerability was also present in the DRY plugin and was assigned CVE-2017-1000103.
*   The provided text also mentions that the Static Analysis Utilities plugin is suspended, but this is not relevant to the vulnerability itself.
