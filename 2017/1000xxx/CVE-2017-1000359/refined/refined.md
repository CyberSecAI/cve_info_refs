The provided document is a Master's thesis on security testing of SDN controllers using fuzzing techniques. While it does not directly describe a specific vulnerability, it outlines a methodology and reports results that led to the discovery of several vulnerabilities that could potentially be mapped to a CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities discovered lies in the implementation flaws within the SDN controllers (OpenDaylight and ONOS) when handling malformed or unexpected OpenFlow protocol messages, or in their REST API implementation. Specifically, the fuzzing process revealed weaknesses in:
- Parsing of OpenFlow messages
- Handling of large numbers of connections
- Resource management
- Flow management in ODL REST API
- Input sanitization when parsing XML using odl-mdsal-xsql component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Multiple DoS vulnerabilities were found, triggered by sending crafted OpenFlow messages, sending repeated REST API requests or by repeatedly opening and closing connections. This leads to:
    - Controller crashes due to excessive thread creation.
    - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) causing performance degradation or service unavailability
    - Inability for legitimate SDN applications to add new flows
- **Unhandled Exceptions:** The controllers exhibit unhandled exceptions (NullPointerExceptions, IllegalArgumentExceptions, IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions, etc.) when parsing malformed packets.
- **Memory Leaks:** In some cases, the fuzzing resulted in memory leaks, where the controller does not properly release allocated resources. This includes stack traces and log files growing to extreme sizes and causing the system to slow down.
- **Parsing errors:** Some packet types may be misinterpreted causing unexpected exceptions due to type mismatch.
- **Lack of input validation** in the odl-mdsal-xsql component allowing for the creation of XML injection vulnerabilities using crafted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Service Disruption:** Legitimate users are denied access to network services controlled by the SDN controller.
- **Network Instability:**  Denial of service attacks on the controller can lead to network outages and disruption of network traffic.
- **Data Integrity:**  Although not a direct result of the exploitation, vulnerabilities may also affect data integrity in cases when switches impersonate each other.
- **Loss of Control:** An attacker can potentially take control of the network by causing the controller to malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Switch:**  An attacker controls a switch and sends malformed or unexpected OpenFlow messages to the SDN controller.
- **Compromised Switch:** An attacker compromises a legitimate switch and uses it to send malicious traffic.
- **Direct Connection:** An attacker directly connects a malicious device to the controller ports.
- **REST API attacks:** An attacker sends multiple requests using a REST client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the SDN controller.
- The attacker can be connected to the SDN network as a legitimate or compromised switch, or directly connected to the network.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the controller, as these vulnerabilities are present before authentication in the initial communication phase.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the OpenFlow protocol and its structures to craft malicious packets.
- In case of REST API attacks, the attacker needs the API credentials.

**Additional Notes**
- The fuzzing process targeted OpenFlow implementation and discovered vulnerabilities in both OpenDaylight and ONOS.
- The thesis also mentions web based vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injections as possible attack vectors although the core of the research is focused on OpenFlow protocol implementation.
- The found vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction to create multistage vulnerabilities.

In summary, while the document doesn't describe a single CVE, it provides valuable insights into the types of vulnerabilities that can be found in SDN controllers using fuzzing and how they can be exploited.
