Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Jenkins storing user-related metadata in directories named after the user ID, without proper sanitization or escaping of the user ID. This allows special characters within user IDs to be interpreted as file system commands or create directory traversal issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unsafe directory naming:** Using user-provided strings directly as directory names without escaping.
- **Directory Traversal:** User names containing `..` could allow an attacker to overwrite other configuration files.
- **Resource deletion**: User names consisting of a single `/` would have their user record stored in the parent directory; deleting this user deleted all user records.
- **Reserved names:** User names could consist of reserved names such as `COM` (on Windows), potentially causing unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Loss:** Deletion of all user records by creating a malicious user account with name `/`
- **Configuration File Manipulation:**  Overwriting other configuration files through directory traversal.
- **System Instability:** Creation of files with reserved names such as `COM` on Windows.

**Attack vectors:**

-  Creation of user accounts with crafted user IDs containing special characters. This can be done by either an admin or regular user (depending on the configured security realm).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to create or modify user accounts or user names through Jenkins interface or an associated authentication mechanism such as LDAP. This could be an attacker with low-level access, as creating accounts and users is usually not only for admins, it can be used by developers with permission to manage users in the system.
