Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2017-1000185.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `MovieAddFrame` function of the `gif2swf` tool. This is caused by a `memcpy` operation that attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `memcpy` within the `MovieAddFrame` function writes beyond the allocated memory region on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The immediate impact is a program crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow, as observed by the AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can often be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted, though this particular exploit only appears to cause a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious GIF file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted GIF file. Specifically, the provided PoC file `swftools/git2swf_-r_2_-o_dev_null_-z_memory_corruption__fopen` is used to trigger the overflow by the `gif2swf` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted GIF file to the `gif2swf` tool.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or pre-existing access to the system to trigger this vulnerability when a user/service processes the crafted GIF with `gif2swf`.
