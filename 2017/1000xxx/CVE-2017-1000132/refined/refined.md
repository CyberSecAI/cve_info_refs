- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the ability to upload and execute arbitrary SWF files within the Mahara platform. Specifically, the "Files to Download" block does not enforce download behavior for flash files, which allows them to be executed inline when a user clicks on a link to a SWF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, achieved through the execution of malicious ActionScript code embedded within a user-uploaded SWF file.
    - Lack of proper handling for file downloads: SWF files, when uploaded as a "file for download", are not being forced to download by the browser via the `content-disposition: attachment` header, allowing them to run directly in the browser.
    - Insufficient security controls on embedded SWF files: When embedding SWF files in the internalmedia block, the `allowscriptaccess` and `allownetworking` parameters are not set to `never`, potentially allowing the SWF to execute scripts or access the network.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Cookie theft: An attacker can steal Mahara users' cookies, compromising their sessions.
    - Account takeover: By stealing cookies, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Redirection to malicious websites: Attackers can redirect users to harmful websites containing malware, trojans, or JavaScript downloaders, potentially resulting in full system compromise.
    - XSS Worm propagation: The vulnerability can be used to spread an XSS worm, affecting a large number of Mahara users.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - File upload: An attacker uploads a malicious SWF file using the "Files to Download" feature.
    - User interaction: A user clicks on the link to the uploaded SWF file, leading to its execution within their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to a Mahara account: An attacker must have a user account on the vulnerable Mahara instance.
    - Ability to upload files: The attacker must have the ability to upload files to the system.
    - Knowledge of SWF exploitation: The attacker should be able to create a malicious SWF file with ActionScript that performs malicious actions.
