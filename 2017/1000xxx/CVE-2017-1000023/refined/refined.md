- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows uploading HTML files containing malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript is then executed in the browser of users who preview the document.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not sanitize or validate HTML files before storage and preview, allowing malicious scripts to be executed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This can be used to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the application interface. In this specific case, an attacker with low privileges can use social engineering to target an administrator to steal their session cookies.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading a malicious HTML file through the application's file upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application, even with the lowest privilege account. The attacker can then leverage social engineering to target higher privileged users.
