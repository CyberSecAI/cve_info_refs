{
  "CVE-2017-1000486": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from two issues: 1) a hard-coded default encryption key ('PrimeSecret'), and 2) a padding oracle attack ('PrimeOracle') against the internal crypto algorithm used to decrypt parameters in PrimeFaces.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded encryption key",
      "Padding oracle vulnerability due to insecure use of DES cipher in CBC mode without verification (HMAC)" ,
      "Expression Language injection vulnerability in StreamedContentHandler"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary Expression Language (EL) code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the application server.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting malicious requests to the `/javax.faces.resource/dynamiccontent.properties.xhtml` endpoint, including a specially crafted and encrypted `pfdrid` parameter. This encrypted payload bypasses a partial security fix using the padding oracle vulnerability to execute arbitrary EL code.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the vulnerability. No authentication is required."
