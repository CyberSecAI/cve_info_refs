As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  openSUSE (At this moment openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.0 and Tumbleweed) please feel free to reopen this bug against that version (!you must update the "Version" component in the bug fields, do not just reopen please), or alternatively create a new ticket.

References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-1000231> <https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/bugs-script/show_bug.cgi?id=1256> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1068711#c1)  Tomáš Chvátal   2019-07-11 11:22:15 UTC  ``` This is automated batch bugzilla cleanup.  The openSUSE 42.3 changed to end-of-life (EOL [1]) status. As such it is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  openSUSE (At this moment openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.0 and Tumbleweed) please feel free to reopen this bug against that version (!you must update the "Version" component in the bug fields, do not just reopen please), or alternatively create a new ticket.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed during the lifetime of the release.
