Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1000231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free error found in `parse.c` of ldns version 1.7.0. Specifically, a double-free occurred during token parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double-free vulnerability. This occurs when memory that has already been freed is freed again, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided descriptions state the impact is "unspecified" but can lead to an application crash.
- A successful exploit could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The initial descriptions indicated "unspecified attack vectors."
- SUSE's analysis suggests a network attack vector with low complexity in their CVSSv3 score, while their own assessment considers a local attack vector with high complexity and required user interaction, where a user might be tricked to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the parsing functionality in `parse.c` of ldns.
- The SUSE information mentions a network vector but also considers a local attack vector with high complexity which requires user interaction.
- The Debian Security Advisory indicates the issue can result in an "application crash."
