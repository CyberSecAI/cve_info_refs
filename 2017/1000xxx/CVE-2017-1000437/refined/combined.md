## Description

[![@r0t0tiller](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10905489?u=74c5dc9c89f73f869e9a6aadabadc873e3211077&v=4&size=48)](/r0t0tiller)[r0t0tiller](https://github.com/r0t0tiller)opened [on Sep 4, 2017](https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity/issues/186#issue-255128011)

Summary:

Gravity is vulnerable to a Stack-Buffer-Overflow in the operator\_string\_add function. ASAN is saying it is a "buffer-underflow" but by looking at gravity under GDB we can see that we are gaining a arbitrary write. This opens up a security risk as a attacker can use this to write passed a static buffer and achieve code execution.

Execution:

./gravity test.gravity
