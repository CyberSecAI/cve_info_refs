The provided content describes a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `operator_string_add` function of the Gravity programming language.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `operator_string_add` function does not properly validate the size of the input strings when performing concatenation, leading to a buffer overflow when the resulting string exceeds the allocated buffer size on the stack. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs due to an integer overflow when adding a large number to a string and then concatenating the result in a loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite stack memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating string concatenation operations within Gravity programs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted Gravity program that performs the vulnerable string concatenation.

The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) code snippet that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability. The ASAN output also confirms that a stack buffer overflow occurs.
