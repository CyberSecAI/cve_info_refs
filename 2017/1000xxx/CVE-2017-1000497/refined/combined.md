[![@prodigysml](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16996819?u=8ac045207384ce660425a4fdded4a836e20988a2&v=4&size=48)](/prodigysml)[prodigysml](https://github.com/prodigysml)opened [on Dec 13, 2017](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/issues/152#issue-281617647)
# Issue

Pepperminty-Wiki is vulnerable to XXE attacks due to the usage of the `simplexml_load_file` function without disabling entities. This leads to a confirmed denial of service scenario (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack>) and may lead to execution of commands on the server.

# Where the Issue Occurred

If an uploaded svg, containing the billion laughs payload, makes its way to the simplexml\_load\_file function, the denial of service scenario is triggered. This exact locations in the code are given below:

[Pepperminty-Wiki/build/index.php](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/blob/e0aeda8b170ed5850c48641f4614cb115655dcdc/build/index.php#L5469)

[e0aeda8](/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/commit/e0aeda8b170ed5850c48641f4614cb115655dcdc)

|  | $svg = simplexml\_load\_file($svgFilename); // Load it as XML |
| --- | --- |

[Pepperminty-Wiki/modules/feature-upload.php](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/blob/e0aeda8b170ed5850c48641f4614cb115655dcdc/modules/feature-upload.php#L624)

|  | $svg = simplexml\_load\_file($svgFilename); // Load it as XML |
| --- | --- |

# Remediation

Prior to loading any xml, disable entities ensuring that the above-mentioned attacks will no longer be possible.

`libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);`
