Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issue discussed in the GitHub issue #33 for the `mahara-mobile-cordova` repository:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Mahara Mobile app was logging user passwords in plain text within the Mahara access logs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Plaintext password logging:** Passwords should never be stored or logged in plain text as it makes them extremely vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If an attacker gains access to the Mahara access logs, they could retrieve user passwords in plain text, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need access to the Mahara server's access logs. This could involve:
    - Compromising the server.
    - Unauthorized access to server files.
    - Accessing the logs through misconfigured server setups.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the server's filesystem or logs. This access could be achieved through a variety of means, such as a compromised account or a vulnerability in the system the server is running on.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was identified by Pawel Kubzdyl.
- The issue was addressed with a security fix in commit `5878b7c` in February 2017.
