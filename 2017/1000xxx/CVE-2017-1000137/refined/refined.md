- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Block title" field of the text box content editor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize the "Block title" when creating a new block, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating or editing a page and injecting malicious JavaScript code in the "Block title" of a "Text box" using the content editor. The XSS is triggered when the user adds another "Text Box" after entering the malicious code
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a user who can create or edit pages within the Mahara application.
