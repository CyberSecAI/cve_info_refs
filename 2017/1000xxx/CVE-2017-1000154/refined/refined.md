The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1000154.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code that checks if a user's authentication instance belongs to a suspended institution was only present in the `LiveUser->login()` method, which is used for username/password logins. External authentication methods like SAML, XMLRPC, and Shibboleth, bypass this check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent application of institution suspension checks across different authentication methods.
- Lack of centralized check for suspended institutions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Users of suspended or expired institutions could still log in through external authentication methods, potentially bypassing intended access restrictions and granting access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Using external authentication methods (SAML, XMLRPC, Shibboleth) to login to Mahara instances that are associated with suspended institutions.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a user with an account associated to a suspended or expired institution using an external auth method to login.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs an existing account in a suspended or expired institution.
- The attacker also needs to use an external authentication method to login to Mahara.
- Access to a Mahara instance that allows external authentication.
