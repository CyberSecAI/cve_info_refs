* Result of `net::EscapeUrlEncodedData` can be used directly in the final url creation below, `escaped_url` `GURL` is not required.
* the `use_plus` parameter should be invoked with false, since we use `net::UnescapeRule::SPACES`  below.

`SPOOFING_AND_CONTROL_CHARS` should be avoided. Also `NORMAL` rule need not be specified, any rule specified includes the normal rule by default.
