The provided content relates to a stack overflow vulnerability in the `pdf2swf` tool within the `swftools` project, and the information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by a crafted input file. Specifically, it appears to be related to how the tool handles string copying, leading to excessive stack usage through recursive calls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability in the `pdf2swf` tool
- Improper handling of a crafted input leading to recursive function calls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to stack overflow
- Potential for denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Inputting a specially crafted PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool via command-line argument.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute `pdf2swf` with control over the input file argument.
- No specific user privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided crash log shows the address sanitizer detecting the stack overflow at memory address `0x7ffc6f304ff0`.
- The crash occurs when running the `pdf2swf` tool with specific command line flags: `-z -i -w -b -l -f -G -I -o /den/null` and a malicious file named `pdf2swf_-z_-i_-w_-b_-l_-f_-G_-I_-o_dev_null_copyString_stack_flow`.
- The call stack shows the recursive calls originating from address `0x4d883d`, leading to stack exhaustion.
