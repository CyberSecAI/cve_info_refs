{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Runtime Broker's Clipboard Broker allows low IL/AppContainer processes to access an OOP IStorage object. The broker wraps application-provided IDataObject objects, which, when accessed, execute code within the Runtime Broker's process, outside the sandbox.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control on clipboard objects, Insecure wrapping of IDataObject, Lack of proper marshaling of IStorage objects leading to unintended code execution in the Runtime Broker process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation from low-integrity/AppContainer process to medium-integrity, Arbitrary code execution outside the sandbox, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local, through the clipboard API.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be running in a low-integrity process such as an AppContainer or low IL process and be able to interact with the clipboard API."
