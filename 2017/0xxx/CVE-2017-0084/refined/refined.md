{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A corrupted font file causes an out-of-bounds read in the `USP10!AssignGlyphTypes` function, leading to subsequent out-of-bounds writes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Out-of-bounds write",
     "Heap corruption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption leading to potential remote code execution, or denial of service due to the crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing of a specially crafted (corrupted) font file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted font file to a vulnerable application. This could be done through a web page, email or any other application that processes fonts."
