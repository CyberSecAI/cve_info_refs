Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `passwordauth` plugin's use of the `CGI::FormBuilder` module within ikiwiki. Specifically, the `CGI::FormBuilder->field("foo")` method, when called in a list context, can return multiple values for a single field (`foo`) instead of the expected single value. This behavior breaks the usual Perl convention for named arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can exploit this flaw to log in as a different user by sending multiple values for login parameters, even if they only have credentials for another account.
- **User Database Manipulation:** An attacker can set arbitrary fields in the user database when creating a new account by crafting requests with multiple values for parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a valid login can potentially gain access to more privileged accounts.
- **Data Tampering:** An attacker can create new user accounts with manipulated data, including potentially setting arbitrary user roles/privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves manipulating the HTTP request to the ikiwiki server. By submitting multiple values for CGI parameters related to login or account creation, an attacker can exploit the flawed handling of the `CGI::FormBuilder` module in the `passwordauth` plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the ikiwiki server.
- The target ikiwiki instance must have the CGI script (cgi_wrapper) enabled.
- The `passwordauth` plugin must also be enabled, which is the default configuration.
- To perform privilege escalation, the attacker needs valid credentials for any existing user. For account manipulation, the attacker does not need any prior credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is related to issues seen in CVE-2016-9646, indicating a pattern of issues in how `CGI::FormBuilder` is used in ikiwiki.
- The vulnerability affects ikiwiki versions >= 2.11 and is fixed in version >= 3.20170111 and 3.20141016.4
