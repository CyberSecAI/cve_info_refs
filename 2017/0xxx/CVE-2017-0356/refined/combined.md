If you are using ikiwiki to render pages that only you can edit, do not
generate any wrappers, and do not use the cgi, then there are no more
security issues with this program than with cat(1). If, however, you let
others edit pages in your wiki, then some possible security issues do need
to be kept in mind.

If you find a new security vulnerability, please email the maintainers
privately instead of listing it in a public bug tracker, so that we can
arrange for coordinated disclosure when a fix is available.

# Probable holes

*(The list of things to fix.)*

## commit spoofing

Anyone with direct commit access can forge "web commit from foo" and
make it appear on [RecentChanges](../recentchanges/) like foo committed. One way to avoid
this would be to limit web commits to those done by a certain user.

## other stuff to look at

I have been meaning to see if any CRLF injection type things can be
done in the CGI code.

---

# Potential gotchas

*(Things not to do.)*

## image file etc attacks

If it enounters a file type it does not understand, ikiwiki just copies it
into place. So if you let users add any kind of file they like, they can
upload images, movies, windows executables, css files, etc (though not html
files). If these files exploit security holes in the browser of someone
who's viewing the wiki, that can be a security problem.

Of course nobody else seems to worry about this in other wikis, so should we?

People with direct commit access can upload such files
(and if you wanted to you could block that with a pre-commit hook).

The attachments plugin is not enabled by default. If you choose to
enable it, you should make use of its powerful abilities to filter allowed
types of attachments, and only let trusted users upload.

It is possible to embed an image in a page edited over the web, by using
`img src="data:image/png;"`. Ikiwiki's htmlscrubber only allows `data:`
urls to be used for `image/*` mime types. It's possible that some broken
browser might ignore the mime type and if the data provided is not an
image, instead run it as javascript, or something evil like that. Hopefully
not many browsers are that broken.

## multiple accessors of wiki directory

If multiple people can directly write to the source directory ikiwiki is
using, or to the destination directory it writes files to, then one can
cause trouble for the other when they run ikiwiki through symlink attacks.

So it's best if only one person can ever directly write to those directories.

## setup files

Setup files are not safe to keep in the same revision control repository
with the rest of the wiki. Just don't do it.

## page locking can be bypassed via direct commits

A locked page can only be edited on the web by an admin, but anyone who is
allowed to commit directly to the repository can bypass this. This is by
design, although a pre-commit hook could be used to prevent editing of
locked pages, if you really need to.

## web server attacks

If your web server does any parsing of special sorts of files (for example,
server parsed html files), then if you let anyone else add files to the wiki,
they can try to use this to exploit your web server.

---

# Hopefully non-holes

*(AKA, the assumptions that will be the root of most security holes...)*

## exploiting ikiwiki with bad content

Someone could add bad content to the wiki and hope to exploit ikiwiki.
Note that ikiwiki runs with perl taint checks on, so this is unlikely.

One fun thing in ikiwiki is its handling of a PageSpec, which involves
translating it into perl and running the perl. Of course, this is done
*very* carefully to guard against injecting arbitrary perl code.

## publishing cgi scripts

ikiwiki does not allow cgi scripts to be published as part of the wiki. Or
rather, the script is published, but it's not marked executable (except in
the case of "destination directory file replacement" below), so hopefully
your web server will not run it.

## suid wrappers

`ikiwiki --wrapper` is intended to generate a wrapper program that
runs ikiwiki to update a given wiki. The wrapper can in turn be made suid,
for example to be used in a [post-commit](../post-commit/) hook by people who cannot write
to the html pages, etc.

If the wrapper program is made suid, then any bugs in this wrapper would be
security holes. The wrapper is written as securely as I know how, is based
on code that has a history of security use long before ikiwiki, and there's
been no problem yet.

## shell exploits

ikiwiki does not expose untrusted data to the shell. In fact it doesn't use
`system(3)` at all, and the only use of backticks is on data supplied by the
wiki admin and untainted filenames.

Ikiwiki was developed and used for a long time with perl's taint checking
turned on as a second layer of defense against shell and other exploits. Due
to a strange [bug](http://bugs.debian.org/411786) in perl, taint checking
is currently disabled for production builds of ikiwiki.

## cgi data security

When ikiwiki runs as a cgi to edit a page, it is passed the name of the
page to edit. It has to make sure to sanitise this page, to prevent eg,
editing of ../../../foo, or editing of files that are not part of the wiki,
such as subversion dotfiles. This is done by sanitising the filename
removing unallowed characters, then making sure it doesn't start with "/"
or contain ".." or "/.svn/", etc. Annoyingly ad-hoc, this kind of code is
where security holes breed. It needs a test suite at the very least.

## CGI::Session security

I've audited this module and it is massively insecure by default. ikiwiki
uses it in one of the few secure ways; by forcing it to write to a
directory it controls (and not /tmp) and by setting a umask that makes the
file not be world readable.

## cgi password security

Login to the wiki using [passwordauth](../plugins/passwordauth/) involves sending a password
in cleartext over the net. Cracking the password only allows editing the wiki
as that user though. If you care, you can use https, I suppose. If you do use
https either for all of the wiki, or just the cgi access, then consider using
the sslcookie option. Using [openid](../plugins/openid/) is a potentially better option.

## XSS holes in CGI output

ikiwiki has been audited to ensure that all cgi script input/output
is sanitised to prevent XSS attacks. For example, a user can't register
with a username containing html code (anymore).

It's difficult to know for sure if all such avenues have really been
closed though.

## HTML::Template security

If the [template](../plugins/template/) plugin is enabled, all users can modify templates
like any other part of the wiki. Some trusted users can modify templates
without it too. This assumes that HTML::Template is secure
when used with untrusted/malicious templates. (Note that includes are not
allowed.)

---

# Plugins

The security of [plugins](../plugins/) depends on how well they're written and what
external tools they use. The plugins included in ikiwiki are all held to
the same standards as the rest of ikiwiki, but with that said, here are
some security notes for them.

* The [img](../plugins/img/) plugin assumes that imagemagick/perlmagick are secure
  from malformed image attacks for at least the formats listed in
  `img_allowed_formats`. Imagemagick has had security holes in the
  past. To be able to exploit such a hole, a user would need to be able to
  upload images to the wiki.

---

# Fixed holes

*(Unless otherwise noted, these were discovered and immediately fixed by the
ikiwiki developers.)*

## destination directory file replacement

Any file in the destination directory that is a valid page filename can be
replaced, even if it was not originally rendered from a page. For example,
ikiwiki.cgi could be edited in the wiki, and it would write out a
replacement. File permission is preseved. Yipes!

This was fixed by making ikiwiki check if the file it's writing to exists;
if it does then it has to be a file that it's aware of creating before, or
it will refuse to create it.

Still, this sort of attack is something to keep in mind.

## symlink attacks

Could a committer trick ikiwiki into following a symlink and operating on
some other tree that it shouldn't? svn supports symlinks, so one can get
into the repo. ikiwiki uses File::Find to traverse the repo, and does not
tell it to follow symlinks, but it might be possible to race replacing a
directory with a symlink and trick it into following the link.

Also, if someone checks in a symlink to /etc/passwd, ikiwiki would read and
publish that, which could be used to expose files a committer otherwise
wouldn't see.

To avoid this, ikiwiki will skip over symlinks when scanning for pages, and
uses locking to prevent more than one instance running at a time. The lock
prevents one ikiwiki from running a svn up/git pull/etc at the wrong time
to race another ikiwiki. So only attackers who can write to the working
copy on their own can race it.

## symlink + cgi attacks

Similarly, a commit of a symlink could be made, ikiwiki ignores it
because of the above, but the symlink is still there, and then you edit the
page from the web, which follows the symlink when reading the page
(exposing the content), and again when saving the changed page (changing
the content).

This was fixed for page saving by making ikiwiki refuse to write to files
that are symlinks, or that are in subdirectories that are symlinks,
combined with the above locking.

For page editing, it's fixed by ikiwiki checking to make sure that it
already has found a page by scanning the tree, before loading it for
editing, which as described above, also is done in a way that avoids
symlink attacks.

## underlaydir override attacks

ikiwiki also scans an underlaydir for pages, this is used to provide stock
pages to all wikis w/o needing to copy them into the wiki. Since ikiwiki
internally stores only the base filename from the underlaydir or srcdir,
and searches for a file in either directory when reading a page source,
there is the potential for ikiwiki's scanner to reject a file from the
srcdir for some reason (such as it being contained in a directory that is
symlinked in), find a valid copy of the file in the underlaydir, and then
when loading the file, mistakenly load the bad file from the srcdir.

This attack is avoided by making ikiwiki refuse to add any files from the
underlaydir if a file also exists in the srcdir with the same name.

## multiple page source issues

Note that I previously worried that underlay override attacks could also be
accomplished if ikiwiki were extended to support other page markup
languages besides markdown. However, a closer look indicates that this is
not a problem: ikiwiki does preserve the file extension when storing the
source filename of a page, so a file with another extension that renders to
the same page name can't bypass the check. Ie, ikiwiki won't skip foo.rst
in the srcdir, find foo.mdwn in the underlay, decide to render page foo and
then read the bad foo.mdwn. Instead it will remember the .rst extension and
only render a file with that extension.

## XSS attacks in page content

ikiwiki supports protecting users from their own broken browsers via the
[htmlscrubber](../plugins/htmlscrubber/) plugin, which is enabled by default.

## svn commit logs

It's was possible to force a whole series of svn commits to appear to
have come just before yours, by forging svn log output. This was
guarded against by using svn log --xml.

ikiwiki escapes any html in svn commit logs to prevent other mischief.

## XML::Parser

XML::Parser is used by the aggregation plugin, and has some security holes.
Bug #[378411](http://bugs.debian.org/378411) does not
seem to affect our use, since the data is not encoded as utf-8 at that
point. #[378412](http://bugs.debian.org/378412) could affect us, although it
doesn't seem very exploitable. It has a simple fix, and has been fixed in
Debian unstable.

## include loops

Various directives that cause one page to be included into another could
be exploited to DOS the wiki, by causing a loop. Ikiwiki has always guarded
against this one way or another; the current solution should detect all
types of loops involving preprocessor directives.

## Online editing of existing css and images

A bug in ikiwiki allowed the web-based editor to edit any file that was in
the wiki, not just files that are page sources. So an attacker (or a
genuinely helpful user, which is how the hole came to light) could edit
files like style.css. It is also theoretically possible that an attacker
could have used this hole to edit images or other files in the wiki, with
some difficulty, since all editing would happen in a textarea.

This hole was discovered on 10 Feb 2007 and fixed the same day with the
release of ikiwiki 1.42. A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as
version 1.33.1. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions if your wiki
allows web editing.

## html insertion via title

Missing html escaping of the title contents allowed a web-based editor to
insert arbitrary html inside the title tag of a page. Since that part of
the page is not processed by the htmlscrubber, evil html could be injected.

This hole was discovered on 21 March 2007 and fixed the same day (er, hour)
with the release of ikiwiki 1.46. A fix was also backported to Debian etch,
as version 1.33.2. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions if your
wiki allows web editing or aggregates feeds.

## javascript insertion via meta tags

It was possible to use the meta plugin's meta tags to insert arbitrary
url contents, which could be used to insert stylesheet information
containing javascript. This was fixed by sanitising meta tags.

This hole was discovered on 21 March 2007 and fixed the same day
with the release of ikiwiki 1.47. A fix was also backported to Debian etch,
as version 1.33.3. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions if your
wiki can be edited by third parties.

## insufficient checking for symlinks in srcdir path

Ikiwiki did not check if path to the srcdir to contained a symlink. If an
attacker had commit access to the directories in the path, they could
change it to a symlink, causing ikiwiki to read and publish files that were
not intended to be published. (But not write to them due to other checks.)

In most configurations, this is not exploitable, because the srcdir is
checked out of revision control, but the directories leading up to it are
not. Or, the srcdir is a single subdirectory of a project in revision
control (ie, `ikiwiki/doc`), and if the subdirectory were a symlink,
ikiwiki would still typically not follow it.

There are at least two configurations where this is exploitable:

* If the srcdir is a deeper subdirectory of a project. For example if it is
  `project/foo/doc`, an an attacker can replace `foo` with a symlink to a
  directory containing a `doc` directory (not a symlink), then ikiwiki
  would follow the symlink.
* If the path to the srcdir in ikiwiki's configuration ended in "/",
  and the srcdir is a single subdirectory of a project, (ie,
  `ikiwiki/doc/`), the srcdir could be a symlink and ikiwiki would not
  notice.

This security hole was discovered on 26 November 2007 and fixed the same
day with the release of ikiwiki 2.14. I recommend upgrading to this version
if your wiki can be committed to by third parties. Alternatively, don't use
a trailing slash in the srcdir, and avoid the (unusual) configurations that
allow the security hole to be exploited.

## javascript insertion via uris

The htmlscrubber did not block javascript in uris. This was fixed by adding
a whitelist of valid uri types, which does not include javascript.
([CVE-2008-0809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0809)) Some urls specifyable by the meta plugin could also
theoretically have been used to inject javascript; this was also blocked
([CVE-2008-0808](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0808)).

This hole was discovered on 10 February 2008 and fixed the same day
with the release of ikiwiki 2.31.1. (And a few subsequent versions..)
A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as version 1.33.4. I recommend
upgrading to one of these versions if your wiki can be edited by third
parties.

## Cross Site Request Forging

Cross Site Request Forging could be used to constuct a link that would
change a logged-in user's password or other preferences if they clicked on
the link. It could also be used to construct a link that would cause a wiki
page to be modified by a logged-in user. ([CVE-2008-0165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0165))

These holes were discovered on 10 April 2008 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 2.42. A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as
version 1.33.5. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions.

## Cleartext passwords

Until version 2.48, ikiwiki stored passwords in cleartext in the `userdb`.
That risks exposing all users' passwords if the file is somehow exposed. To
pre-emtively guard against that, current versions of ikiwiki store password
hashes (using Eksblowfish).

If you use the [passwordauth](../plugins/passwordauth/) plugin, I recommend upgrading to
ikiwiki 2.48, installing the [Authen::Passphrase](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=Authen%3A%3APassphrase) perl module, and running
`ikiwiki-transition hashpassword` to replace all existing cleartext passwords
with strong blowfish hashes.

You might also consider changing to [openid](../plugins/openid/), which does not
require ikiwiki deal with passwords at all, and does not involve users sending
passwords in cleartext over the net to log in, either.

## Empty password security hole

This hole allowed ikiwiki to accept logins using empty passwords, to openid
accounts that didn't use a password. It was introduced in version 1.34, and
fixed in version 2.48. The [bug](http://bugs.debian.org/483770) was
discovered on 30 May 2008 and fixed the same day. ([CVE-2008-0169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0169))

I recommend upgrading to 2.48 immediatly if your wiki allows both password
and openid logins.

## Malformed UTF-8 DOS

Feeding ikiwiki page sources containing certian forms of malformed UTF-8
can cause it to crash. This can potentially be used for a denial of service
attack.

intrigeri discovered this problem on 12 Nov 2008 and a patch put in place
later that day, in version 2.70. The fix was backported to testing as version
2.53.3, and to stable as version 1.33.7.

## Insufficient blacklisting in teximg plugin

Josh Triplett discovered on 28 Aug 2009 that the teximg plugin's
blacklisting of insecure TeX commands was insufficient; it could be
bypassed and used to read arbitrary files. This was fixed by
enabling TeX configuration options that disallow unsafe TeX commands.
The fix was released on 30 Aug 2009 in version 3.1415926, and was
backported to stable in version 2.53.4. If you use the teximg plugin,
I recommend upgrading. ([CVE-2009-2944](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2944))

## javascript insertion via svg uris

Ivan Shmakov pointed out that the htmlscrubber allowed `data:image/*` urls,
including `data:image/svg+xml`. But svg can contain javascript, so that is
unsafe.

This hole was discovered on 12 March 2010 and fixed the same day
with the release of ikiwiki 3.20100312.
A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as version 2.53.5. I recommend
upgrading to one of these versions if your wiki can be edited by third
parties.

## javascript insertion via insufficient htmlscrubbing of comments

Kevin Riggle noticed that it was not possible to configure
`htmlscrubber_skip` to scrub comments while leaving unscubbed the text
of eg, blog posts. Confusingly, setting it to " *and !comment(*)" did not
scrub comments.

Additionally, it was discovered that comments' html was never scrubbed during
preview or moderation of comments with such a configuration.

These problems were discovered on 12 November 2010 and fixed the same
hour with the release of ikiwiki 3.20101112. ([CVE-2010-1673](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1673))

## javascript insertion via insufficient checking in comments

Dave B noticed that attempting to comment on an illegal page name could be
used for an XSS attack.

This hole was discovered on 22 Jan 2011 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20110122. A fix was backported to Debian squeeze,
as version 3.20100815.5. An upgrade is recommended for sites
with the comments plugin enabled. ([CVE-2011-0428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0428))

## possible javascript insertion via insufficient htmlscrubbing of alternate stylesheets

Giuseppe Bilotta noticed that 'meta stylesheet` directives allowed anyone
who could upload a malicious stylesheet to a site to add it to a
page as an alternate stylesheet, or replacing the default stylesheet.

This hole was discovered on 28 Mar 2011 and fixed the same hour with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20110328. A fix was backported to Debian squeeze,
as version 3.20100815.6. An upgrade is recommended for sites that have
untrusted committers, or have the attachments plugin enabled.
([CVE-2011-1401](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1401))

## tty hijacking via ikiwiki-mass-rebuild

Ludwig Nussel discovered a way for users to hijack root's tty when
ikiwiki-mass-rebuild was run. Additionally, there was some potential
for information disclosure via symlinks. ([CVE-2011-1408](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1408))

This hole was discovered on 8 June 2011 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20110608. Note that the fix is dependant on
a version of su that has a similar hole fixed. Version 4.1.5 of the shadow
package contains the fixed su; [Debian bug #628843](http://bugs.debian.org/628843) tracks fixing the hole in
Debian. An upgrade is a must for any sites that have `ikiwiki-update-wikilist`
installed suid (not the default), and whose admins run `ikiwiki-mass-rebuild`.

## javascript insertion via meta tags

RaÃºl Benencia discovered an additional XSS exposure in the meta plugin.
([CVE-2012-0220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0220))

This hole was discovered on 16 May 2012 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20120516. A fix was backported to Debian squeeze,
as version 3.20100815.9. An upgrade is recommended for all sites.

## XSS via openid selector

Raghav Bisht discovered this XSS in the openid selector. ([CVE-2015-2793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2793))

The hole was reported on March 24th, a fix was developed on March 27th,
and the fixed version 3.20150329 was released on the 29th. A fix was backported
to Debian jessie as version 3.20141016.2 and to Debian wheezy as version
3.20120629.2. An upgrade is recommended for sites using CGI and openid.

## XSS via error messages

CGI error messages did not escape HTML meta-characters, potentially
allowing an attacker to carry out cross-site scripting by directing a
user to a URL that would result in a crafted ikiwiki error message. This
was discovered on 4 May by the ikiwiki developers, and the fixed version
3.20160506 was released on 6 May. The same fixes were backported to Debian
8 "jessie" in version 3.20141016.3. A backport to Debian 7 "wheezy" is
in progress.

An upgrade is recommended for sites using
the CGI. ([CVE-2016-4561](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4561), OVE-20160505-0012)

## ImageMagick CVE-2016â3714 ("ImageTragick")

ikiwiki 3.20160506 and 3.20141016.3 attempt to mitigate
[CVE-2016-3714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3714), and any
future ImageMagick vulnerabilities that resemble it, by restricting the
image formats that the [img](../ikiwiki/directive/img/) directive is willing to
resize. An upgrade is recommended for sites where an untrusted user is
able to attach images. Upgrading ImageMagick to a version where
CVE-2016-3714 has been fixed is also recommended, but at the time of
writing no such version is available.

## Perl CVE-2016-1238 (current working directory in search path)

ikiwiki 3.20160728 attempts to mitigate [CVE-2016-1238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1238) by
removing `'.'` from the Perl library search path. An attacker with write
access to ikiwiki's current working directory could potentially use this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary Perl code. An upgrade is recommended
for sites where an untrusted user is able to attach files with arbitrary
names and/or run a setuid ikiwiki wrapper with a working directory of
their choice.

## Editing restriction bypass for git revert

intrigeri discovered that a web or git user could revert a change to a
page they are not allowed to edit, if the change being reverted was made
before the page was moved from a location where that user had permission
to edit it. For example, if a file is moved from `drafts/policy.mdwn`
(editable by less-trusted users) to `policy.mdwn` (only editable
by more-trusted users), a less-trusted user could revert a change
that was made to `drafts/policy.mdwn` prior to that move, and it would
result in `policy.mdwn` being altered.

This affects sites with the `git` VCS and the `recentchanges` plugin,
which are both used in most ikiwiki installations.

This bug was reported on 2016-12-17. A partially fixed version
3.20161219 was released on 2016-12-19, but the solution used in that
version was not effective with git versions older than 2.8.0.
A more complete fix was released on 2016-12-29 in version 3.20161229,
with fixes backported to Debian 8 in version 3.20141016.4.

([CVE-2016-10026](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10026) represents the original vulnerability.
[CVE-2016-9645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9645)/OVE-20161226-0002 represents the vulnerability
in 3.20161219 caused by the incomplete fix.)

## Commit metadata forgery via CGI::FormBuilder context-dependent APIs

When CGI::FormBuilder->field("foo") is called in list context (and
in particular in the arguments to a subroutine that takes named
arguments), it can return zero or more values for foo from the CGI
request, rather than the expected single value. This breaks the usual
Perl parsing convention for named arguments, similar to CVE-2014-1572
in Bugzilla (which was caused by a similar API design issue in CGI.pm).

In ikiwiki, this appears to have been exploitable in two places, both
of them relatively minor:

* in the comments plugin, an attacker who was able to post a comment
  could give it a user-specified author and author-URL even if the wiki
  configuration did not allow for that, by crafting multiple values
  for other fields
* in the editpage plugin, an attacker who was able to edit a page
  could potentially forge commit authorship (attribute their edit to
  someone else) by crafting multiple values for the rcsinfo field

This was fixed in ikiwiki 3.20161229, with fixes backported to Debian 8
in version 3.20141016.4.

([CVE-2016-9646](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9646)/OVE-20161226-0001)

## Authentication bypass via repeated parameters

The ikiwiki maintainers discovered further flaws similar to CVE-2016-9646
in the passwordauth plugin's use of CGI::FormBuilder, with a more
serious impact:

* An attacker who can log in to a site with a password can log in
  as a different and potentially more privileged user.
* An attacker who can create a new account can set arbitrary fields
  in the user database for that account.

This was fixed in ikiwiki 3.20170111, with fixes backported to Debian 8
in version 3.20141016.4.

([CVE-2017-0356](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0356)/OVE-20170111-0001)

## Server-side request forgery via aggregate plugin

The ikiwiki maintainers discovered that the [aggregate](../plugins/aggregate/) plugin
did not use [LWPx::ParanoidAgent](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=LWPx%3A%3AParanoidAgent). On sites where the
aggregate plugin is enabled, authorized wiki editors could tell ikiwiki
to fetch potentially undesired URIs even if LWPx::ParanoidAgent was
installed:

* local files via `file:` URIs
* other URI schemes that might be misused by attackers, such as `gopher:`
* hosts that resolve to loopback IP addresses (127.x.x.x)
* hosts that resolve to RFC 1918 IP addresses (192.168.x.x etc.)

This could be used by an attacker to publish information that should not have
been accessible, cause denial of service by requesting "tarpit" URIs that are
slow to respond, or cause undesired side-effects if local web servers implement
["unsafe"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.1) GET requests.
([CVE-2019-9187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9187))

Additionally, if the LWPx::ParanoidAgent module was not installed, the
[blogspam](../plugins/blogspam/), [openid](../plugins/openid/) and [pinger](../plugins/pinger/) plugins
would fall back to [LWP](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=LWP), which is susceptible to similar attacks.
This is unlikely to be a practical problem for the blogspam plugin because
the URL it requests is under the control of the wiki administrator, but
the openid plugin can request URLs controlled by unauthenticated remote
users, and the pinger plugin can request URLs controlled by authorized
wiki editors.

This is addressed in ikiwiki 3.20190228 as follows, with the same fixes
backported to Debian 9 in version 3.20170111.1:

* URI schemes other than `http:` and `https:` are not accepted, preventing
  access to `file:`, `gopher:`, etc.
* If a proxy is [configured in the ikiwiki setup file](../tips/using_a_proxy/),
  it is used for all outgoing `http:` and `https:` requests. In this case
  the proxy is responsible for blocking any requests that are undesired,
  including loopback or RFC 1918 addresses.
* If a proxy is not configured, and LWPx::ParanoidAgent is installed,
  it will be used. This prevents loopback and RFC 1918 IP addresses, and
  sets a timeout to avoid denial of service via "tarpit" URIs.
* Otherwise, the ordinary LWP user-agent will be used. This allows requests
  to loopback and RFC 1918 IP addresses, and has less robust timeout
  behaviour. We are not treating this as a vulnerability: if this
  behaviour is not acceptable for your site, please make sure to install
  LWPx::ParanoidAgent or disable the affected plugins.

ikiwiki is a static site generator with some dynamic features,
used for wikis, blogs and other websites.

The ikiwiki maintainers discovered two related flaws in the
passwordauth plugin's use of CGI::FormBuilder, involving API design
issues similar to those that led to CVE-2014-1572. Impact:

* An attacker who can log in to a site with a password can log in
  as a different and potentially more privileged user.
* An attacker who can create a new account can set arbitrary fields
  in the user database for that account.

Sites that enable the CGI script (cgi_wrapper) and do not disable the
simple password authentication plugin (passwordauth, enabled by default)
are affected.

For current releases, this is fixed in ikiwiki >= 3.20170111.
For the Debian 8 branch, it is fixed in ikiwiki 3.20141016.4.

# Probable holes

*(The list of things to fix.)*

## commit spoofing

Anyone with direct commit access can forge "web commit from foo" and
make it appear on [RecentChanges](../recentchanges/) like foo committed. One way to avoid
this would be to limit web commits to those done by a certain user.

## other stuff to look at

I have been meaning to see if any CRLF injection type things can be
done in the CGI code.

---

# Potential gotchas

*(Things not to do.)*

## image file etc attacks

If it enounters a file type it does not understand, ikiwiki just copies it
into place. So if you let users add any kind of file they like, they can
upload images, movies, windows executables, css files, etc (though not html
files). If these files exploit security holes in the browser of someone
who's viewing the wiki, that can be a security problem.

Of course nobody else seems to worry about this in other wikis, so should we?

People with direct commit access can upload such files
(and if you wanted to you could block that with a pre-commit hook).

The attachments plugin is not enabled by default. If you choose to
enable it, you should make use of its powerful abilities to filter allowed
types of attachments, and only let trusted users upload.

It is possible to embed an image in a page edited over the web, by using
`img src="data:image/png;"`. Ikiwiki's htmlscrubber only allows `data:`
urls to be used for `image/*` mime types. It's possible that some broken
browser might ignore the mime type and if the data provided is not an
image, instead run it as javascript, or something evil like that. Hopefully
not many browsers are that broken.

## multiple accessors of wiki directory

If multiple people can directly write to the source directory ikiwiki is
using, or to the destination directory it writes files to, then one can
cause trouble for the other when they run ikiwiki through symlink attacks.

So it's best if only one person can ever directly write to those directories.

## setup files

Setup files are not safe to keep in the same revision control repository
with the rest of the wiki. Just don't do it.

## page locking can be bypassed via direct commits

A locked page can only be edited on the web by an admin, but anyone who is
allowed to commit directly to the repository can bypass this. This is by
design, although a pre-commit hook could be used to prevent editing of
locked pages, if you really need to.

## web server attacks

If your web server does any parsing of special sorts of files (for example,
server parsed html files), then if you let anyone else add files to the wiki,
they can try to use this to exploit your web server.

---

# Hopefully non-holes

*(AKA, the assumptions that will be the root of most security holes...)*

## exploiting ikiwiki with bad content

Someone could add bad content to the wiki and hope to exploit ikiwiki.
Note that ikiwiki runs with perl taint checks on, so this is unlikely.

One fun thing in ikiwiki is its handling of a PageSpec, which involves
translating it into perl and running the perl. Of course, this is done
*very* carefully to guard against injecting arbitrary perl code.

## publishing cgi scripts

ikiwiki does not allow cgi scripts to be published as part of the wiki. Or
rather, the script is published, but it's not marked executable (except in
the case of "destination directory file replacement" below), so hopefully
your web server will not run it.

## suid wrappers

`ikiwiki --wrapper` is intended to generate a wrapper program that
runs ikiwiki to update a given wiki. The wrapper can in turn be made suid,
for example to be used in a [post-commit](../post-commit/) hook by people who cannot write
to the html pages, etc.

If the wrapper program is made suid, then any bugs in this wrapper would be
security holes. The wrapper is written as securely as I know how, is based
on code that has a history of security use long before ikiwiki, and there's
been no problem yet.

## shell exploits

ikiwiki does not expose untrusted data to the shell. In fact it doesn't use
`system(3)` at all, and the only use of backticks is on data supplied by the
wiki admin and untainted filenames.

Ikiwiki was developed and used for a long time with perl's taint checking
turned on as a second layer of defense against shell and other exploits. Due
to a strange [bug](http://bugs.debian.org/411786) in perl, taint checking
is currently disabled for production builds of ikiwiki.

## cgi data security

When ikiwiki runs as a cgi to edit a page, it is passed the name of the
page to edit. It has to make sure to sanitise this page, to prevent eg,
editing of ../../../foo, or editing of files that are not part of the wiki,
such as subversion dotfiles. This is done by sanitising the filename
removing unallowed characters, then making sure it doesn't start with "/"
or contain ".." or "/.svn/", etc. Annoyingly ad-hoc, this kind of code is
where security holes breed. It needs a test suite at the very least.

## CGI::Session security

I've audited this module and it is massively insecure by default. ikiwiki
uses it in one of the few secure ways; by forcing it to write to a
directory it controls (and not /tmp) and by setting a umask that makes the
file not be world readable.

## cgi password security

Login to the wiki using [passwordauth](../plugins/passwordauth/) involves sending a password
in cleartext over the net. Cracking the password only allows editing the wiki
as that user though. If you care, you can use https, I suppose. If you do use
https either for all of the wiki, or just the cgi access, then consider using
the sslcookie option. Using [openid](../plugins/openid/) is a potentially better option.

## XSS holes in CGI output

ikiwiki has been audited to ensure that all cgi script input/output
is sanitised to prevent XSS attacks. For example, a user can't register
with a username containing html code (anymore).

It's difficult to know for sure if all such avenues have really been
closed though.

## HTML::Template security

If the [template](../plugins/template/) plugin is enabled, all users can modify templates
like any other part of the wiki. Some trusted users can modify templates
without it too. This assumes that HTML::Template is secure
when used with untrusted/malicious templates. (Note that includes are not
allowed.)

---

# Plugins

The security of [plugins](../plugins/) depends on how well they're written and what
external tools they use. The plugins included in ikiwiki are all held to
the same standards as the rest of ikiwiki, but with that said, here are
some security notes for them.

* The [img](../plugins/img/) plugin assumes that imagemagick/perlmagick are secure
  from malformed image attacks for at least the formats listed in
  `img_allowed_formats`. Imagemagick has had security holes in the
  past. To be able to exploit such a hole, a user would need to be able to
  upload images to the wiki.

---

# Fixed holes

*(Unless otherwise noted, these were discovered and immediately fixed by the
ikiwiki developers.)*

## destination directory file replacement

Any file in the destination directory that is a valid page filename can be
replaced, even if it was not originally rendered from a page. For example,
ikiwiki.cgi could be edited in the wiki, and it would write out a
replacement. File permission is preseved. Yipes!

This was fixed by making ikiwiki check if the file it's writing to exists;
if it does then it has to be a file that it's aware of creating before, or
it will refuse to create it.

Still, this sort of attack is something to keep in mind.

## symlink attacks

Could a committer trick ikiwiki into following a symlink and operating on
some other tree that it shouldn't? svn supports symlinks, so one can get
into the repo. ikiwiki uses File::Find to traverse the repo, and does not
tell it to follow symlinks, but it might be possible to race replacing a
directory with a symlink and trick it into following the link.

Also, if someone checks in a symlink to /etc/passwd, ikiwiki would read and
publish that, which could be used to expose files a committer otherwise
wouldn't see.

To avoid this, ikiwiki will skip over symlinks when scanning for pages, and
uses locking to prevent more than one instance running at a time. The lock
prevents one ikiwiki from running a svn up/git pull/etc at the wrong time
to race another ikiwiki. So only attackers who can write to the working
copy on their own can race it.

## symlink + cgi attacks

Similarly, a commit of a symlink could be made, ikiwiki ignores it
because of the above, but the symlink is still there, and then you edit the
page from the web, which follows the symlink when reading the page
(exposing the content), and again when saving the changed page (changing
the content).

This was fixed for page saving by making ikiwiki refuse to write to files
that are symlinks, or that are in subdirectories that are symlinks,
combined with the above locking.

For page editing, it's fixed by ikiwiki checking to make sure that it
already has found a page by scanning the tree, before loading it for
editing, which as described above, also is done in a way that avoids
symlink attacks.

## underlaydir override attacks

ikiwiki also scans an underlaydir for pages, this is used to provide stock
pages to all wikis w/o needing to copy them into the wiki. Since ikiwiki
internally stores only the base filename from the underlaydir or srcdir,
and searches for a file in either directory when reading a page source,
there is the potential for ikiwiki's scanner to reject a file from the
srcdir for some reason (such as it being contained in a directory that is
symlinked in), find a valid copy of the file in the underlaydir, and then
when loading the file, mistakenly load the bad file from the srcdir.

This attack is avoided by making ikiwiki refuse to add any files from the
underlaydir if a file also exists in the srcdir with the same name.

## multiple page source issues

Note that I previously worried that underlay override attacks could also be
accomplished if ikiwiki were extended to support other page markup
languages besides markdown. However, a closer look indicates that this is
not a problem: ikiwiki does preserve the file extension when storing the
source filename of a page, so a file with another extension that renders to
the same page name can't bypass the check. Ie, ikiwiki won't skip foo.rst
in the srcdir, find foo.mdwn in the underlay, decide to render page foo and
then read the bad foo.mdwn. Instead it will remember the .rst extension and
only render a file with that extension.

## XSS attacks in page content

ikiwiki supports protecting users from their own broken browsers via the
[htmlscrubber](../plugins/htmlscrubber/) plugin, which is enabled by default.

## svn commit logs

It's was possible to force a whole series of svn commits to appear to
have come just before yours, by forging svn log output. This was
guarded against by using svn log --xml.

ikiwiki escapes any html in svn commit logs to prevent other mischief.

## XML::Parser

XML::Parser is used by the aggregation plugin, and has some security holes.
Bug #[378411](http://bugs.debian.org/378411) does not
seem to affect our use, since the data is not encoded as utf-8 at that
point. #[378412](http://bugs.debian.org/378412) could affect us, although it
doesn't seem very exploitable. It has a simple fix, and has been fixed in
Debian unstable.

## include loops

Various directives that cause one page to be included into another could
be exploited to DOS the wiki, by causing a loop. Ikiwiki has always guarded
against this one way or another; the current solution should detect all
types of loops involving preprocessor directives.

## Online editing of existing css and images

A bug in ikiwiki allowed the web-based editor to edit any file that was in
the wiki, not just files that are page sources. So an attacker (or a
genuinely helpful user, which is how the hole came to light) could edit
files like style.css. It is also theoretically possible that an attacker
could have used this hole to edit images or other files in the wiki, with
some difficulty, since all editing would happen in a textarea.

This hole was discovered on 10 Feb 2007 and fixed the same day with the
release of ikiwiki 1.42. A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as
version 1.33.1. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions if your wiki
allows web editing.

## html insertion via title

Missing html escaping of the title contents allowed a web-based editor to
insert arbitrary html inside the title tag of a page. Since that part of
the page is not processed by the htmlscrubber, evil html could be injected.

This hole was discovered on 21 March 2007 and fixed the same day (er, hour)
with the release of ikiwiki 1.46. A fix was also backported to Debian etch,
as version 1.33.2. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions if your
wiki allows web editing or aggregates feeds.

## javascript insertion via meta tags

It was possible to use the meta plugin's meta tags to insert arbitrary
url contents, which could be used to insert stylesheet information
containing javascript. This was fixed by sanitising meta tags.

This hole was discovered on 21 March 2007 and fixed the same day
with the release of ikiwiki 1.47. A fix was also backported to Debian etch,
as version 1.33.3. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions if your
wiki can be edited by third parties.

## insufficient checking for symlinks in srcdir path

Ikiwiki did not check if path to the srcdir to contained a symlink. If an
attacker had commit access to the directories in the path, they could
change it to a symlink, causing ikiwiki to read and publish files that were
not intended to be published. (But not write to them due to other checks.)

In most configurations, this is not exploitable, because the srcdir is
checked out of revision control, but the directories leading up to it are
not. Or, the srcdir is a single subdirectory of a project in revision
control (ie, `ikiwiki/doc`), and if the subdirectory were a symlink,
ikiwiki would still typically not follow it.

There are at least two configurations where this is exploitable:

* If the srcdir is a deeper subdirectory of a project. For example if it is
  `project/foo/doc`, an an attacker can replace `foo` with a symlink to a
  directory containing a `doc` directory (not a symlink), then ikiwiki
  would follow the symlink.
* If the path to the srcdir in ikiwiki's configuration ended in "/",
  and the srcdir is a single subdirectory of a project, (ie,
  `ikiwiki/doc/`), the srcdir could be a symlink and ikiwiki would not
  notice.

This security hole was discovered on 26 November 2007 and fixed the same
day with the release of ikiwiki 2.14. I recommend upgrading to this version
if your wiki can be committed to by third parties. Alternatively, don't use
a trailing slash in the srcdir, and avoid the (unusual) configurations that
allow the security hole to be exploited.

## javascript insertion via uris

The htmlscrubber did not block javascript in uris. This was fixed by adding
a whitelist of valid uri types, which does not include javascript.
([CVE-2008-0809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0809)) Some urls specifyable by the meta plugin could also
theoretically have been used to inject javascript; this was also blocked
([CVE-2008-0808](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0808)).

This hole was discovered on 10 February 2008 and fixed the same day
with the release of ikiwiki 2.31.1. (And a few subsequent versions..)
A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as version 1.33.4. I recommend
upgrading to one of these versions if your wiki can be edited by third
parties.

## Cross Site Request Forging

Cross Site Request Forging could be used to constuct a link that would
change a logged-in user's password or other preferences if they clicked on
the link. It could also be used to construct a link that would cause a wiki
page to be modified by a logged-in user. ([CVE-2008-0165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0165))

These holes were discovered on 10 April 2008 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 2.42. A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as
version 1.33.5. I recommend upgrading to one of these versions.

## Cleartext passwords

Until version 2.48, ikiwiki stored passwords in cleartext in the `userdb`.
That risks exposing all users' passwords if the file is somehow exposed. To
pre-emtively guard against that, current versions of ikiwiki store password
hashes (using Eksblowfish).

If you use the [passwordauth](../plugins/passwordauth/) plugin, I recommend upgrading to
ikiwiki 2.48, installing the [Authen::Passphrase](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=Authen%3A%3APassphrase) perl module, and running
`ikiwiki-transition hashpassword` to replace all existing cleartext passwords
with strong blowfish hashes.

You might also consider changing to [openid](../plugins/openid/), which does not
require ikiwiki deal with passwords at all, and does not involve users sending
passwords in cleartext over the net to log in, either.

## Empty password security hole

This hole allowed ikiwiki to accept logins using empty passwords, to openid
accounts that didn't use a password. It was introduced in version 1.34, and
fixed in version 2.48. The [bug](http://bugs.debian.org/483770) was
discovered on 30 May 2008 and fixed the same day. ([CVE-2008-0169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0169))

I recommend upgrading to 2.48 immediatly if your wiki allows both password
and openid logins.

## Malformed UTF-8 DOS

Feeding ikiwiki page sources containing certian forms of malformed UTF-8
can cause it to crash. This can potentially be used for a denial of service
attack.

intrigeri discovered this problem on 12 Nov 2008 and a patch put in place
later that day, in version 2.70. The fix was backported to testing as version
2.53.3, and to stable as version 1.33.7.

## Insufficient blacklisting in teximg plugin

Josh Triplett discovered on 28 Aug 2009 that the teximg plugin's
blacklisting of insecure TeX commands was insufficient; it could be
bypassed and used to read arbitrary files. This was fixed by
enabling TeX configuration options that disallow unsafe TeX commands.
The fix was released on 30 Aug 2009 in version 3.1415926, and was
backported to stable in version 2.53.4. If you use the teximg plugin,
I recommend upgrading. ([CVE-2009-2944](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2944))

## javascript insertion via svg uris

Ivan Shmakov pointed out that the htmlscrubber allowed `data:image/*` urls,
including `data:image/svg+xml`. But svg can contain javascript, so that is
unsafe.

This hole was discovered on 12 March 2010 and fixed the same day
with the release of ikiwiki 3.20100312.
A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as version 2.53.5. I recommend
upgrading to one of these versions if your wiki can be edited by third
parties.

## javascript insertion via insufficient htmlscrubbing of comments

Kevin Riggle noticed that it was not possible to configure
`htmlscrubber_skip` to scrub comments while leaving unscubbed the text
of eg, blog posts. Confusingly, setting it to " *and !comment(*)" did not
scrub comments.

Additionally, it was discovered that comments' html was never scrubbed during
preview or moderation of comments with such a configuration.

These problems were discovered on 12 November 2010 and fixed the same
hour with the release of ikiwiki 3.20101112. ([CVE-2010-1673](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1673))

## javascript insertion via insufficient checking in comments

Dave B noticed that attempting to comment on an illegal page name could be
used for an XSS attack.

This hole was discovered on 22 Jan 2011 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20110122. A fix was backported to Debian squeeze,
as version 3.20100815.5. An upgrade is recommended for sites
with the comments plugin enabled. ([CVE-2011-0428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0428))

## possible javascript insertion via insufficient htmlscrubbing of alternate stylesheets

Giuseppe Bilotta noticed that 'meta stylesheet` directives allowed anyone
who could upload a malicious stylesheet to a site to add it to a
page as an alternate stylesheet, or replacing the default stylesheet.

This hole was discovered on 28 Mar 2011 and fixed the same hour with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20110328. A fix was backported to Debian squeeze,
as version 3.20100815.6. An upgrade is recommended for sites that have
untrusted committers, or have the attachments plugin enabled.
([CVE-2011-1401](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1401))

## tty hijacking via ikiwiki-mass-rebuild

Ludwig Nussel discovered a way for users to hijack root's tty when
ikiwiki-mass-rebuild was run. Additionally, there was some potential
for information disclosure via symlinks. ([CVE-2011-1408](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1408))

This hole was discovered on 8 June 2011 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20110608. Note that the fix is dependant on
a version of su that has a similar hole fixed. Version 4.1.5 of the shadow
package contains the fixed su; [Debian bug #628843](http://bugs.debian.org/628843) tracks fixing the hole in
Debian. An upgrade is a must for any sites that have `ikiwiki-update-wikilist`
installed suid (not the default), and whose admins run `ikiwiki-mass-rebuild`.

## javascript insertion via meta tags

RaÃºl Benencia discovered an additional XSS exposure in the meta plugin.
([CVE-2012-0220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0220))

This hole was discovered on 16 May 2012 and fixed the same day with
the release of ikiwiki 3.20120516. A fix was backported to Debian squeeze,
as version 3.20100815.9. An upgrade is recommended for all sites.

## XSS via openid selector

Raghav Bisht discovered this XSS in the openid selector. ([CVE-2015-2793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2793))

The hole was reported on March 24th, a fix was developed on March 27th,
and the fixed version 3.20150329 was released on the 29th. A fix was backported
to Debian jessie as version 3.20141016.2 and to Debian wheezy as version
3.20120629.2. An upgrade is recommended for sites using CGI and openid.

## XSS via error messages

CGI error messages did not escape HTML meta-characters, potentially
allowing an attacker to carry out cross-site scripting by directing a
user to a URL that would result in a crafted ikiwiki error message. This
was discovered on 4 May by the ikiwiki developers, and the fixed version
3.20160506 was released on 6 May. The same fixes were backported to Debian
8 "jessie" in version 3.20141016.3. A backport to Debian 7 "wheezy" is
in progress.

An upgrade is recommended for sites using
the CGI. ([CVE-2016-4561](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4561), OVE-20160505-0012)

## ImageMagick CVE-2016â3714 ("ImageTragick")

ikiwiki 3.20160506 and 3.20141016.3 attempt to mitigate
[CVE-2016-3714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3714), and any
future ImageMagick vulnerabilities that resemble it, by restricting the
image formats that the [img](../ikiwiki/directive/img/) directive is willing to
resize. An upgrade is recommended for sites where an untrusted user is
able to attach images. Upgrading ImageMagick to a version where
CVE-2016-3714 has been fixed is also recommended, but at the time of
writing no such version is available.

## Perl CVE-2016-1238 (current working directory in search path)

ikiwiki 3.20160728 attempts to mitigate [CVE-2016-1238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1238) by
removing `'.'` from the Perl library search path. An attacker with write
access to ikiwiki's current working directory could potentially use this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary Perl code. An upgrade is recommended
for sites where an untrusted user is able to attach files with arbitrary
names and/or run a setuid ikiwiki wrapper with a working directory of
their choice.

## Editing restriction bypass for git revert

intrigeri discovered that a web or git user could revert a change to a
page they are not allowed to edit, if the change being reverted was made
before the page was moved from a location where that user had permission
to edit it. For example, if a file is moved from `drafts/policy.mdwn`
(editable by less-trusted users) to `policy.mdwn` (only editable
by more-trusted users), a less-trusted user could revert a change
that was made to `drafts/policy.mdwn` prior to that move, and it would
result in `policy.mdwn` being altered.

This affects sites with the `git` VCS and the `recentchanges` plugin,
which are both used in most ikiwiki installations.

This bug was reported on 2016-12-17. A partially fixed version
3.20161219 was released on 2016-12-19, but the solution used in that
version was not effective with git versions older than 2.8.0.
A more complete fix was released on 2016-12-29 in version 3.20161229,
with fixes backported to Debian 8 in version 3.20141016.4.

([CVE-2016-10026](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10026) represents the original vulnerability.
[CVE-2016-9645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9645)/OVE-20161226-0002 represents the vulnerability
in 3.20161219 caused by the incomplete fix.)

## Commit metadata forgery via CGI::FormBuilder context-dependent APIs

When CGI::FormBuilder->field("foo") is called in list context (and
in particular in the arguments to a subroutine that takes named
arguments), it can return zero or more values for foo from the CGI
request, rather than the expected single value. This breaks the usual
Perl parsing convention for named arguments, similar to CVE-2014-1572
in Bugzilla (which was caused by a similar API design issue in CGI.pm).

In ikiwiki, this appears to have been exploitable in two places, both
of them relatively minor:

* in the comments plugin, an attacker who was able to post a comment
  could give it a user-specified author and author-URL even if the wiki
  configuration did not allow for that, by crafting multiple values
  for other fields
* in the editpage plugin, an attacker who was able to edit a page
  could potentially forge commit authorship (attribute their edit to
  someone else) by crafting multiple values for the rcsinfo field

This was fixed in ikiwiki 3.20161229, with fixes backported to Debian 8
in version 3.20141016.4.

([CVE-2016-9646](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9646)/OVE-20161226-0001)

## Authentication bypass via repeated parameters

The ikiwiki maintainers discovered further flaws similar to CVE-2016-9646
in the passwordauth plugin's use of CGI::FormBuilder, with a more
serious impact:

* An attacker who can log in to a site with a password can log in
  as a different and potentially more privileged user.
* An attacker who can create a new account can set arbitrary fields
  in the user database for that account.

This was fixed in ikiwiki 3.20170111, with fixes backported to Debian 8
in version 3.20141016.4.

([CVE-2017-0356](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0356)/OVE-20170111-0001)

## Server-side request forgery via aggregate plugin

The ikiwiki maintainers discovered that the [aggregate](../plugins/aggregate/) plugin
did not use [LWPx::ParanoidAgent](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=LWPx%3A%3AParanoidAgent). On sites where the
aggregate plugin is enabled, authorized wiki editors could tell ikiwiki
to fetch potentially undesired URIs even if LWPx::ParanoidAgent was
installed:

* local files via `file:` URIs
* other URI schemes that might be misused by attackers, such as `gopher:`
* hosts that resolve to loopback IP addresses (127.x.x.x)
* hosts that resolve to RFC 1918 IP addresses (192.168.x.x etc.)

This could be used by an attacker to publish information that should not have
been accessible, cause denial of service by requesting "tarpit" URIs that are
slow to respond, or cause undesired side-effects if local web servers implement
["unsafe"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.1) GET requests.
([CVE-2019-9187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9187))

Additionally, if the LWPx::ParanoidAgent module was not installed, the
[blogspam](../plugins/blogspam/), [openid](../plugins/openid/) and [pinger](../plugins/pinger/) plugins
would fall back to [LWP](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=LWP), which is susceptible to similar attacks.
This is unlikely to be a practical problem for the blogspam plugin because
the URL it requests is under the control of the wiki administrator, but
the openid plugin can request URLs controlled by unauthenticated remote
users, and the pinger plugin can request URLs controlled by authorized
wiki editors.

This is addressed in ikiwiki 3.20190228 as follows, with the same fixes
backported to Debian 9 in version 3.20170111.1:

* URI schemes other than `http:` and `https:` are not accepted, preventing
  access to `file:`, `gopher:`, etc.
* If a proxy is [configured in the ikiwiki setup file](../tips/using_a_proxy/),
  it is used for all outgoing `http:` and `https:` requests. In this case
  the proxy is responsible for blocking any requests that are undesired,
  including loopback or RFC 1918 addresses.
* If a proxy is not configured, and LWPx::ParanoidAgent is installed,
  it will be used. This prevents loopback and RFC 1918 IP addresses, and
  sets a timeout to avoid denial of service via "tarpit" URIs.
* Otherwise, the ordinary LWP user-agent will be used. This allows requests
  to loopback and RFC 1918 IP addresses, and has less robust timeout
  behaviour. We are not treating this as a vulnerability: if this
  behaviour is not acceptable for your site, please make sure to install
  LWPx::ParanoidAgent or disable the affected plugins.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
