Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0871:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the system constructs `Throwable` objects. An attacker can trick the system into constructing a non-real, potentially malicious class instead of a real `Throwable`. This is due to insufficient validation when constructing these objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper object construction, specifically related to `Throwable` objects.
- Lack of adequate checks or sanitization when creating `Throwable` instances.
- Potential for type confusion by constructing a fake `Throwable`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP): A malicious application can leverage this vulnerability to bypass security restrictions and gain elevated access, potentially leading to the acquisition of additional permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the affected Android device.
- The malicious app must be able to trigger the flawed object construction process.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided AOSP link shows a change that addresses the issue by ensuring that only real `Throwable` objects are constructed, indicating a fix for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity.
