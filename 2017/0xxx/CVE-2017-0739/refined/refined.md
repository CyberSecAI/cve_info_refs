Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `libhevc` library, specifically within the `Equalizer::setParameter` function. It's a memory corruption issue. The commit message indicates a "memory overflow" when setting parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a memory overflow, specifically in how parameters are set within the `Equalizer` class. This suggests an issue with how the `setParameter` function handles input data size, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact is listed as "Information Disclosure". The attacker could potentially read sensitive memory by triggering the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted file that is processed by the affected `libhevc` library, leading to the memory overflow during parameter setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to supply the malicious file, presumably via a media processing path of some kind, in order to trigger the vulnerability. This could involve exploiting other vulnerabilities to get the malicious data to the targeted library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue is in the commit with the ID: `e6e353a231f746743866d360b88ef8ced367bcb1`
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions: 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, and 7.1.2
- This vulnerability is related to processing of HEVC encoded media, which means an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted HEVC file
- The severity of this issue is categorized as "Moderate"
