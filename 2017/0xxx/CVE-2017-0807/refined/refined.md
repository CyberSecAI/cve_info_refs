Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in `File.getCanonicalPath` where it uses a cache which may contain stale data if underlying files were modified by another process or code not aware of the canonical path cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `File.getCanonicalPath` method may return inaccurate results due to the use of a cache that is not properly invalidated when underlying files are modified. This indicates an improper caching mechanism.
- The core weakness is the potential for stale data in the canonical path cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The potential security implications are not fully specified. However, the description indicates that this inaccurate path resolution could lead to security issues by using an incorrect file path. This can allow an attacker to potentially bypass intended file access restrictions or execute code using a path they shouldn't have access to.
- The Pixel/Nexus Security Bulletin identifies this as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability, meaning a malicious application could use this flaw to gain access to additional permissions it should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious app could modify files that are used to compute canonical paths in order to influence or cause `File.getCanonicalPath` to return an inaccurate path.
- A local attacker could exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local attacker with the ability to modify files.
- The attacker must be able to execute a malicious application on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue disables the `File.getCanonicalPath` caches, this indicates that a complete fix may have not been developed and instead the vulnerability was mitigated through removing the cache entirely.
- The vulnerability impacts a wide range of Android versions, from 4.4.4 to 7.1.2, which makes it a significant issue.
