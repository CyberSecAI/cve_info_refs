  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2017-0614",
      "Root cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment Communicator driver.",
      "Weaknesses": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. The weakness lies in how the Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment Communicator driver handles specific operations, allowing for privilege escalation when exploited.",
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a local malicious application to gain kernel-level privileges, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the device. This could involve unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of malware, or permanent device damage that may require reflashing the operating system.",
      "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to install and execute a specifically crafted application on the targeted device.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to install and execute a malicious application on the targeted device. This usually requires the user to explicitly install a third-party application or be tricked into installing it."
