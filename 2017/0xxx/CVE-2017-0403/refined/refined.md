{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel performance subsystem.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. This may result in a permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local malicious application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to install and execute a malicious application locally on the device."
