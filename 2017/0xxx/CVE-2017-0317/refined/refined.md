- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA GPU and GeForce Experience installer fails to set proper permissions on the package extraction path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper permissions on the package extraction path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A non-privileged user can tamper with the extracted files, potentially leading to privilege escalation through code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A non-privileged user can modify the extracted files before the installer executes them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user on the system where the NVIDIA GPU or GeForce Experience installer is being used and needs to tamper with the extracted files during the installation process.
