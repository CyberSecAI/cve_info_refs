  "CVE-2017-0135": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "This CVE refers to a security feature bypass vulnerability in Microsoft Edge caused by improper handling of the Same Origin Policy when using the XSS filter.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Edge's XSS filter incorrectly modifies or removes meta tags, particularly those related to Content Security Policy (CSP), when it detects a potential XSS payload in a URL parameter that is also present in the HTML.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Security Feature Bypass: The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the Content Security Policy (CSP), which is a security mechanism designed to prevent XSS attacks. By manipulating the meta tag that defines the CSP, the attacker can inject and execute malicious scripts.",
          "XSS Filter Abuse: The XSS filter, intended to prevent XSS, is abused to remove CSP directives by modifying the <meta> tag."
      ],
      "impact": "The primary impact is the ability to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP), allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves crafting a URL that includes a meta tag (specifically, the CSP meta tag) as a parameter. When a user visits this URL, the Edge browser's XSS filter incorrectly identifies this parameter as a potential XSS payload and modifies the meta tag, effectively disabling the CSP.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. The user needs to click on this malicious URL. This attack is primarily a client-side attack, requiring the user to visit a specially crafted link."
