{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the HTC touchscreen driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This is achieved by compromising a privileged process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context, which may lead to a complete device compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local malicious application on the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device, and the app needs to be able to compromise a privileged process to exploit the HTC touchscreen driver vulnerability."
