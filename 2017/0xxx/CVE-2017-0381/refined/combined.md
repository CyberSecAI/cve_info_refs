# Opus: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201702-21**

A vulnerability in Opus could cause memory corruption.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/opus** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.3-r1** |

### Background

Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec.

### Description

A large NLSF values could cause the stabilization code in
silk/NLSF\_stabilize.c to wrap-around and have the last value in
NLSF\_Q15[] to be negative, close to -32768.

Under normal circumstances, the code will simply read from the wrong
table resulting in an unstable LPC filter. The filter would then go
through the LPC stabilization code at the end of silk\_NLSF2A().

Ultimately, the output audio would be garbage, but no worse than with
any other harmless bad packet.

Please see the referenced upstream patch and Debian bug report below for
a detailed analysis.

However, the original report was about a successful exploitation of
Android’s Mediaserver in conjunction with this vulnerability.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
stream, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Opus users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/opus-1.1.3-r1"

```

# Android Security Bulletin—January 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published January 03, 2017 | Updated February 2, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of January 05, 2017 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on December 05,
2016 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-01-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-01-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    and 2017-01-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the January
  05, 2017 security patch level.

## Security vulnerability summary

The tables below contains a list of security vulnerabilities, the Common
Vulnerability and Exposures ID (CVE), the assessed severity, and whether or not
Google devices are affected. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-01-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-01-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the January 1, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of January 5, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-01-01](#2017-01-01-details) and
[2017-01-05](#2017-01-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running the
  latest available version of Android are affected by the issue, the table
  will have "None" in the *Updated Google devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

Subject: CVE-2017-0381
Date: Tue, 17 Jan 2017 01:25:27 -0500
```
Hi,

[CVE-2017-0381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0381) states that:
"A remote code execution vulnerability in silk/NLSF_stabilize.c in
libopus in Mediaserver could enable an attacker using a specially
crafted file to cause memory corruption during media file and data
processing."

Now I'm not sure who did the analysis of this bug, but the analysis we
did concluded that the very worst that could happen was a slightly out
of bounds *read* 256 bytes before a constant table. What this means in
practice is that the value is read from another table and the decoded
data audio will sound bad (which was already going to happen if you're
decoding garbage data).

The worst case that could happen is a plain crash. This would happen if
the code is compiled with assertions (the code would assert before
making the read), or -- if you're really unlucky -- if the table is
placed just after some unreadable memory.

So while the bug definitely needed to be fixed -- and was fixed back in
July -- we don't consider it to be a severe security issue. If you
disagree with our analysis, could you point out what we missed?

Cheers,

	Jean-Marc

```

Version: 1.2~alpha2-1
Distribution: unstable
Urgency: medium
Maintainer: Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>
Changed-By: Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>
Description:
 libopus-dbg - debugging symbols for libopus
 libopus-dev - Opus codec library development files

 libopus0   - Opus codec runtime library
Closes: [851612](bugreport.cgi?bug=851612)
Changes:
 opus (1.2~alpha2-1) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   * Run the tonality analysis at 24 kHz, which reduces complexity while giving
     better frequency resolution for the tonality estimate.
   * Speech quality improvements especially in the 12-20 kbit/s range.
   * Improved VBR encoding for hybrid mode.
   * More aggressive use of wider speech bandwidth, including fullband speech
     starting at 14 kbit/s.
   * Music quality improvements in the 32-48 kb/s range.
   * Generic and SSE CELT optimizations.
   * Support for directly encoding packets up to 120 ms.
   * DTX support for CELT mode.
   * SILK CBR improvements.
   * Ensure that NLSF cannot be negative when computing a min distance between
     them.  This was reported and fixed in July, and assessed as having only a
     relatively minor impact (garbage output, from the garbage input needed to
     trigger it), or at very worst, an assertion failure or simple crash from
     a slightly out of bounds read.  In December it was assigned [CVE-2017-0381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0381)
     by someone other than the upstream developers, with claims of it being a
     'Critical' issue on Android, but we're yet to see any analysis to back
     that up.  Closes: #[851612](bugreport.cgi?bug=851612)

Apologies for the long delay, Jean-Marc. Thanks a lot for your
analysis.

Ron, would it be possible that you fix that issue via an upcoming
point release for jessie? It would not warrant a DSA on it's own.

Salvatore

We could cherry pick that patch back into 1.1 that's in Jessie, but
unless someone does find a more serious hole in the upstream analysis,
the interesting question would be what do we actually want to achieve
with a point release update?

After we decided to tag 1.2-alpha2 as the best candidate for Stretch,
Jean-Marc also applied this to the 1.1 branch, now tagged as 1.1.4,
for people who did want the fix, but didn't want to jump to the 1.2
changes yet - since there was some amount of hysteria growing attached
to it based on the original CVE claims.

Between 1.1 and 1.1.4 there have actually been a number of patches
to fix things of approximately this severity (this code is continually
being fuzzed and subjected to new analysis, and that does shake out
new corner cases with numeric precision and the like from time to time).

So if we're going to update Jessie because this is "severe enough" to
warrant that (but not so serious to do as a DSA), it would seem a bit
silly to not pull in all of the fixes in that category, or to prioritise
them purely on "how much publicity someone else gave them".

The downside of that is the diff between 1.1 and 1.1.4 isn't something
I expect the SRMs will find a delight to review.  And cherry picking
all of them individually will probably be a significant amount of
error prone work, that personally I'd have a lot less faith in not
introducing an accidental regression.  I don't yet know how many of
them are significantly linked to prior patches in the series.

This patch is the only diff between 1.1.3 and 1.1.4, and 1.1.3 spent
a few months in Stretch without incident before this update.

In "normal use", most people are unlikely to hit any of these issues,
but if we want a stable update where we can honestly say "fixes all
known corner cases where corrupt or maliciously crafted input can do
Something Bad", we probably do want to consider pulling in significantly
more of 1.1.4 than just this patch.  And if we want what we pull in to
have been tested, then pulling in 1.1.4 verbatim would be the safest bet
by a fair margin.

If there's a real regression to that, it would be an upstream bug and
there'll be a 1.1.5 to fix it as soon as it's known ...  This is now
a 'serious' bugfix only branch.  New work is all for 1.2.

I've CC'd -release, to see what they'd prefer we do for Jessie.
It might be that the best option here is to just put something later
in -bpo, and if people are paranoid, they can choose to use that?

  Cheers,
  Ron

I'd prefer to review patches rather than walls of text that refer to
changes in the abstract, since that makes it easier to know what you're
talking about.  But based on what I've read it doesn't sound like jessie
needs an update?

This is the commit (along with the analysis):
<https://git.xiph.org/?p=opus.git;a=commitdiff;h=70a3d641b>

That being said, the change itself will not help you much unless you
pull out the full source, since the illegal read occurs in a different file.

Cheers,

Unless there's a surprise reveal about the real severity, I think it
would be theatre to push just this patch and not the similar things
fixed without fanfare in 1.1.4 as an SPU - and I don't think 1.1.4 is
in the usual comfort zone for an SPU, or that any of these are known
to be serious enough to warrant making an uncomfortable exception.

Salvatore asked me to look at our options, so I gave enough context
for people to do their own detailed assessment if they feel they want
to disagree.  If someone is really worried about being exposed by 1.1
in Jessie, they'd be much better off with a -bpo of what's in Stretch,
or a -sloppy backport of 1.1.4, than with just this one issue patched.

If we later find any of them are more seriously exploitable, we can
put a targetted fix through -security or -p-u for just that, but we'd
have already done that if the upstream analysis thought they were.

It looks like the language and severity of the original CVE has been
toned down now based on the analysis given here anyway - so even the
"it would be good PR to show this as fixed in Jessie" argument isn't
as strong as it was a week ago when I originally replied.

  Thanks!
  Ron
