Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-0590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) library, specifically in how it handles SPS (Sequence Parameter Set) parsing. The issue occurs when the parser reads more bytes than specified by the nal length field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read**: The parser reads beyond the allocated memory buffer when processing the SPS data, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:**  As stated in the Android Security Bulletin, a successful exploit could lead to memory corruption and potentially remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially crafted media file**: An attacker can craft a malicious HEVC encoded media file containing a manipulated SPS with a nal length that is smaller than the actual data length.
- **Multiple methods**: The bulletin mentions multiple attack vectors, such as email, web browsing, and MMS, that could be used to deliver the malicious media file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to deliver malicious media**: The attacker needs the ability to deliver the malicious file to a vulnerable device. This could be done by sending the file via email, hosting it on a website, or via MMS.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check in the SPS parsing logic to ensure that the parser does not read more bytes than the nal length.
- The provided commit messages show that this fix was cherry-picked from earlier commits, indicating that the vulnerability was present in older versions and needed to be patched in the newer codebase.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Critical" due to the potential for remote code execution.
