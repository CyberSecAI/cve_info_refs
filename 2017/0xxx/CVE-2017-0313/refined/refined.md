Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-0313:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `DxgkDdiSubmitCommandVirtual` function of the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver (specifically in `nvlddmkm.sys`). This function is responsible for submitting command buffers to the GPU.
*   The issue stems from insufficient validation of user-provided input used to determine the memory region for a copy operation. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary length and source offset for the copy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unchecked Length:** The `len` value used in `memcpy` is not properly validated, despite checks existing that only call a debug logging function.
*   **Unchecked Offset (size field):** The `size` field in the `NvPrivateHeader` structure, which is used as the offset for the copy source, is not checked against the actual buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can lead to a system crash, causing a denial of service.
*   **Escalation of Privileges:** The memory corruption could also be potentially exploited to gain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local, as the attacker must have access to the system to call the vulnerable `DxgkDdiSubmitCommandVirtual` function via the user-mode driver.
*   The attacker controls the `len` and `size` values through a crafted command buffer, which is passed through to the kernel driver's `DxgkDdiSubmitCommandVirtual` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to interact with the NVIDIA GPU driver to submit a specially crafted command buffer containing malicious data.
*   The attacker requires local access to the system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The kernel driver allocates a buffer for vendor-specific data from the user-mode driver.
*   The user-provided data is structured as `NvPrivateHeader` and `NvPrivateData`.
*   The driver performs a `memcpy` operation based on the user provided `len` and an offset within the buffer.
*   The vulnerability occurs because the `len` and the offset are not correctly validated before the `memcpy`, allowing for out-of-bounds memory access.
*   The vulnerability is triggered in a copy operation where the `src` address is calculated using user-controlled header.size without proper validation, and the length of the copy is determined by user-provided input.
*   The `memcpy` operation copies `8 * len` bytes from the crafted source address (`src`) to the destination address (`priv_data`)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit-db entry includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) crash, showing a `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA` on a Windows 10 x64 system with driver version 375.95.
*   The fix was included in driver version 378.52 for Windows and 378.13 for Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris
*   The vulnerability is present in the kernel-mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`).
