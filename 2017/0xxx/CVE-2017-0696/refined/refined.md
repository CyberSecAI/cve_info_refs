Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0696:

**CVE-2017-0696**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists while searching for a valid PPS (Picture Parameter Set) element in the AVC (Advanced Video Coding) library. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during the parsing of PPS syntax elements within the `libavc` library.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow. This occurs when the code attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer, potentially corrupting adjacent memory regions.
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** Insufficient error checking during PPS parsing allows for a malicious or malformed input to trigger the overflow. The vulnerability specifically occurs when parsing `second_chroma_qp_index_offset` within a PPS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided information indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition. This could occur due to memory corruption which causes the process handling the media to crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Specially Crafted Media File:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious AVC media file containing a malformed PPS element.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, since they only need to deliver a specially crafted file to the vulnerable device.
    *   **Ability to Deliver Malicious Media:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious media content to the system. This might be through a website, a messaging app, or other mechanisms that process media files.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `libavc` library.
*   The fix involves adding an error check while parsing PPS syntax elements specifically the `second_chroma_qp_index_offset` element.
*   The commit messages highlight the addition of error checks to prevent the buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided source code commits contain the specific fix.
* The vulnerability is categorized as a Denial of Service (DoS) with High severity.
