{
  "CVE-2017-0899": {
    "description": "rubygems: Escape sequence in the \"summary\" field of gemspec",
    "root_cause": "The rubygems module was found to not properly sanitize gems' specification text, specifically in the \"summary\" field. A specially crafted gem could contain terminal escape sequences that could then be executed when displaying the gem summary.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of escape sequences",
      "Insufficient sanitization of input",
      "Unrestricted text output leading to terminal injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could insert malicious escape sequences that when rendered in a user's terminal, can lead to arbitrary command execution, modification of terminal settings, or other malicious actions.  This can occur when listing gem details or summaries through the command line.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted gemspec file",
       "Maliciously crafted gem hosted on a repository",
      "Display of gem summary using command line"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create a gem with a malicious \"summary\" field and host it on a repository, or have it included in a gem cache or otherwise accessed by the victim."
