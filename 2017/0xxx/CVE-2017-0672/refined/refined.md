Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0672:

**CVE-2017-0672**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing size limit for BMP images within the Skia graphics library. Specifically, this issue leads to a denial of service vulnerability when handling crafted, large BMP images, since the program attempts to allocate memory that is too big.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted BMP image that leads to excessive memory allocation, ultimately crashing the application.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper size validation for BMP image inputs, allowing for the processing of extremely large, potentially invalid images.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. An application using the vulnerable Skia library will crash when attempting to process a malicious BMP image.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted BMP image.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted BMP image to an application using the vulnerable Skia library. This might be achieved through various means depending on the application being targeted (e.g., a user uploading an image, receiving an image via network, etc).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit log specifies that the fix implemented adds a limit on the size of BMP images, aligning with the limit used by Chromium, thus preventing crashes due to excessively large images.
*   The vulnerability is present in Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1 and 7.1.2.
*   The fix is available in the AOSP repository: `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/skia/%2B/c4087ff5486d36a690c681affb668164ec0dd697`
