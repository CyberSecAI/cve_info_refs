Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0753:

**CVE-2017-0753**

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability exists in a library, specifically within the Android platform's codebase. The nature of the vulnerability is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it involves the processing of a "specially crafted file".
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is a flaw that allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE) when handling a malformed file. This indicates a lack of proper input validation or bounds checking in how the library parses or processes such files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code within the context of an unprivileged process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, delivered through a "specially crafted file." This file likely triggers the vulnerability upon processing by the vulnerable library. It is likely that this file would need to be processed by a component or app that utilizes the vulnerable library.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver or cause the processing of the specially crafted file by a vulnerable process. This could potentially be achieved through various methods such as sending the file via email, tricking a user into opening it, or delivering it through a malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is marked as "High" severity.
*   The affected AOSP versions are 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0.
