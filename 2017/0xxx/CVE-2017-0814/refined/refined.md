Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds access in the codebook processing within the Tremolo library. Specifically, when processing codebooks, the software attempts to access memory locations beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Out-of-bounds read: The primary vulnerability is the possibility of reading memory beyond the boundaries of allocated buffers during codebook processing. This can lead to information disclosure and potentially other issues

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory due to the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Maliciously crafted media files: The attack can likely be triggered by processing a specially crafted media file that contains malformed codebook data, forcing the vulnerable code to access memory outside of the allocated bounds.
-  The vulnerability is located within the "external/tremolo" component of the Android framework

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to provide a malicious media file to a vulnerable device/application to trigger the vulnerable code path
- No special privileges are needed, as the vulnerability lies within the media processing logic

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as a "Moderate" severity issue in the provided security bulletin.
- The fix addresses an out-of-bounds access issue which can lead to information disclosure.
- The fix is implemented in the `external/tremolo` component of AOSP.
