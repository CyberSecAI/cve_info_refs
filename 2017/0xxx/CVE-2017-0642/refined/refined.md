{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An issue was found in the handling of multi-view buffers during the release from a reference.",
    "weaknesses": "When checking multi-view (mv) buffers for release from reference, unallocated mv buffers were also being checked. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.",
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the incorrect handling of memory buffers. Specifically, the incorrect check could lead to a loop accessing an unallocated memory which can cause a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves processing media files that trigger the flawed buffer handling logic.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to provide a specially crafted media file that can be processed by the vulnerable media framework to trigger the vulnerability."
