Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how the Microsoft scripting engine handles objects in memory, specifically function expressions with names captured in parameter scopes. When a function or variable declaration with the same name exists in the body of the function, the function expression name could be incorrectly marked as shadowed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability leads to memory corruption, where incorrect handling of scopes causes the function's name symbol not to be added to the correct scope (either parameter or body scope).
- **Incorrect Scope Handling:** The core weakness is in how the scripting engine determines the correct scope for function names, especially when dealing with function expressions, named parameters, and variable declarations within the same function. Specifically, it has issues with splitting parameter and body scope correctly when a named function expression is captured in the parameter scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means they can gain the same user rights as the user running the affected browser.
- **Full User Control:** Gaining control over the user's context allows the attacker to perform a wide range of malicious activities.
- **Memory Corruption:** The root cause, which is memory corruption, can cause instability in other areas.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the internet or a network.
- **Web Browser:** The vulnerability affects how Microsoft scripting engines render content within browsers. Exploitation typically involves delivering malicious content (e.g., through a website) that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction, making it highly dangerous. The user only has to navigate to the malicious page or content.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send the malicious content to the victim, usually through a network.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit `9da019424601325a6e95e6be0fa03d7d21d0b517` addresses the issue by modifying the parsing logic to properly handle function expressions. When the name is captured in the parameter scope, the parameter and body scopes are split so that the name symbol is added to the parameter scope, not the body scope.
- The fix prevents the incorrect shadowing of function expression names, which caused the symbol not to be added to the body, thus causing the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a high CVSS score of 8.1, highlighting its severity.
- The provided GitHub Advisory also notes a high EPSS score indicating a significant probability of exploitation.

The vulnerability is related to mishandling of scopes while parsing Javascript function expressions which leads to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
