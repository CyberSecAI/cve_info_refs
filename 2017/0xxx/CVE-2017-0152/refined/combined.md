…n param scope

In a function expression with name, where the name is captured in one
of the param scope functions, if there is a function or var declaration
with the same name as the function expression name we were marking the
function expression name as shadowed. In non-eval case this causes
issue because the name symbol won't get added to the body. This change is to
fix it in such a way if the name is captured in the param scope then we
split the param and body scope such that the name symbol is added to the
param scope not body scope.

## Description

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way affected Microsoft scripting engine render when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user, aka "Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability."

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
