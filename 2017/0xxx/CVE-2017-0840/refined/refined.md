Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient parameter and value size checking within the `EffectBundle` component, specifically related to the way graphic buffer modes are tracked within `OMXNodeInstance`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper validation of the size of parameters and their values within `EffectBundle`, which is used to manage audio effects.
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** This vulnerability is classified as an information disclosure issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
