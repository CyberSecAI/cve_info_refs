{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `USP10!ttoGetTableData` function of the Windows Uniscribe library, triggered by a malformed TTF font file. The function attempts to read data from a memory address based on an offset within the font data structure. When the font is malformed, this offset can lead to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory read"
    ],
    "impact": "The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash (denial-of-service), and potentially, the disclosure of sensitive data from the process heap if exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by loading and processing a specially crafted, malformed TTF font file.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide the malformed font file to a system or application that uses the Uniscribe library to render text, which then attempts to load the font."
