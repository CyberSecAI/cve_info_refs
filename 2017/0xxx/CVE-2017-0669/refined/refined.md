  "CVE-2017-0669": {
    "Description": "After uninstalling an app, if the system was shutdown before the download provider received the broadcast for UID_REMOVED, another app installed later in the same uid might be able to gain access to files downloaded by this app. Removing such hanging downloads at the start up of the download provider should fix this issue.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs when an app is uninstalled and the system is shut down before the download provider processes the UID_REMOVED broadcast. When a new app is installed with the same UID later, it can potentially access files downloaded by the previously uninstalled app.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate cleanup of downloaded files after app uninstallation."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to files downloaded by a previously uninstalled application by installing an app with the same UID.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to uninstall an app, then shutdown the system before the download provider processes the UID_REMOVED broadcast. Subsequently install a new app with the same UID after system restart.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to install and uninstall applications and to have the device shutdown."
  }
