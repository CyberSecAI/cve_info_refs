{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of the record size in relation to the number of declared rectangles when handling the EmfPlusSetTSClip EMF+ record.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read in `gdiplus!GetRECTSForPlayback`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash). Potential disclosure of junk/out-of-bounds heap bytes, but not confirmed to lead to memory corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted EMF+ image file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a malicious EMF+ file to be processed by a GDI+ client (e.g. displaying the image)."
