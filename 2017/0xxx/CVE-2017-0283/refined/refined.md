  "CVE-2017-0283": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-based memory corruption in USP10!MergeLigRecords",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is triggered within the `memcpy` function due to a malformed font file. Specifically, the `MergeLigRecords` function is called within a loop, and a specific attribute is modified by the `ttoGetTableInfo` call causing the crash in `memcpy`.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution",
      "Attack vectors": "By opening a specially crafted font file, an attacker could cause memory corruption and potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to get the victim to open a malformed font file. This could be through a website or other file transfer method."
