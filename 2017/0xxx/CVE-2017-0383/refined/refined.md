{
  "CVE-2017-0383": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the `unsafeReadTypedVector` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability occurs because a size passed to `std::vector` is not properly checked, potentially causing an integer overflow. If exceptions are disabled, this leads to an under-allocation and an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local malicious application can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application can trigger the vulnerability through an improperly sized vector.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a local malicious application installed on the device."
  }
