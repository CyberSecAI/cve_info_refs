Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located in the `libhevc` component, specifically related to how it handles tile indices. The commit message mentions "Fix tile index buf alloc size", suggesting an issue with buffer allocation when dealing with tile indices in HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) decoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect buffer allocation size:** The core problem is that the code allocates a buffer with an incorrect size for storing tile indices. This likely leads to a heap buffer overflow when writing to the undersized buffer, because the code writes beyond the allocated space if the number of tiles exceeds expectations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HEVC file. By triggering the buffer overflow, the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the privileged process (likely the media server process) that handles video decoding.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted HEVC file:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious HEVC file that exploits the tile index handling logic to cause the buffer overflow during decoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, since the vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious media file. They do not need any specific access to the device other than the ability to send it a specially crafted HEVC file.
- **Privileged process context:** The exploitation occurs within a privileged process, likely the media server, thus allowing the attacker to execute code with those privileges if successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than a simple "PLACEHOLDER" description. It gives information about the component (libhevc) and the nature of the bug (tile index buffer allocation size).
- The fix included in the commit identified is likely related to increasing the buffer size to correctly handle the tile indices based on the HEVC video stream.
