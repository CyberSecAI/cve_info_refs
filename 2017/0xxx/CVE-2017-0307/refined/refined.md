  "CVE-2017-0307": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Integer overflow in NVIDIA Tegra DRM driver leads to buffer overflow.",
    "details": "The NVIDIA Tegra kernel contains a vulnerability in the DRM driver. The driver performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate. However, an integer overflow can occur, causing less memory to be allocated than expected, which may lead to a buffer overflow. This could result in a denial of service or a potential escalation of privileges.",
    "affected_components": [
      "NVIDIA Tegra DRM driver"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow during memory allocation size calculation, leading to insufficient memory allocation and a subsequent buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service or escalation of privileges.",
     "attack_vector": "Local access",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Local access with low privileges."
