{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel sound subsystem.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A local malicious application could exploit a vulnerability in the kernel sound subsystem to gain elevated privileges.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel, potentially leading to a permanent device compromise requiring reflashing of the operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring a malicious application to be installed on the device.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to install and execute a malicious application on the target device."
