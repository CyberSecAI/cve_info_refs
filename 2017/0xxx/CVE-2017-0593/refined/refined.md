Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Android Framework APIs related to permission handling. Specifically, it allows an application to potentially change permission protection levels, leading to a privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Permission Handling:** The core issue is that the system does not properly restrict changes to permission protection levels, allowing an app to potentially elevate the protection level of a normal permission to dangerous.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An application can exploit this vulnerability to elevate its privileges by manipulating permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious application could gain access to custom permissions that it would not normally have. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.
- **Bypassing Operating System Protections:** This vulnerability bypasses the operating system's intended isolation of application data, allowing for cross-application attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A locally installed malicious application can exploit the vulnerability.
- The application would add a normal permission to another app's group and then redefine that permission as dangerous.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Locally Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- **No special permissions:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to carry out the attack.
