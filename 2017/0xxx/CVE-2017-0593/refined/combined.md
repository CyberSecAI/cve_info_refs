# Android Security Bulletin—May 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published May 01, 2017 | Updated October 03, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of May 05, 2017 or later address all of these
issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on April 03, 2017
or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-05-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-05-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-05-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-05-01
    and 2017-05-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the May 05,
  2017 security patch level.

## Android and Google Service Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2016_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the
[Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-05-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-05-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-05-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-05-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-05-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-05-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the May 01, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of May 05, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-05-01](#2017-05-01-details) and
[2017-05-05](#2017-05-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One, Nexus Player,
  Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

## Revisions

  Android introduced runtime permissions in order to provide users with more contextual information to make informed decisions as well as with finer granularity when dealing with permissions. In this work, we identified that the correct operation of the runtime permission model relies on certain implicit assumptions which can conveniently be broken by adversaries to illegitimately obtain permissions from the background while impersonating foreground apps. We call this detrimental scenario false transparency attacks. These attacks constitute a serious security threat to the Android platform as they invalidate the security guarantees of 1) runtime permissions by enabling background apps to spoof the context and identity of foreground apps when requesting permissions and of 2) Android permissions altogether by allowing adversaries to exploit users' trust in other apps to obtain permissions.

  Android leverages a set of system permissions to
  protect platform resources. At the same time, it allows untrusted
  third-party applications to declare their own custom permissions
  to regulate access to app components. However, Android treats
  custom permissions the same way as system permissions even
  though they are declared by entities of different trust levels. In
  this work, we describe two new classes of vulnerabilities that arise
  from the ‘predicament’ created by mixing system and custom
  permissions in Android. These have been acknowledged as serious
  security flaws by Google and we demonstrate how they can be
  exploited in practice to gain unauthorized access to platform
  resources and to compromise popular Android apps. To address
  the shortcomings of the system, we propose a new modular
  design called Cusper for the Android permission model. Cusper
  separates the management of system and custom permissions and
  introduces a backward-compatible naming convention for custom
  permissions to prevent custom permission spoofing. We validate
  the correctness of Cusper by 1) introducing the first formal
  model of Android runtime permissions, 2) extending it to describe
  Cusper, and 3) formally showing that key security properties
  that can be violated in the current permission model are always
  satisfied in Cusper. To demonstrate Cusper’s practicality, we
  implemented it in the Android platform and showed that it is
  both effective and efficient.

  In-app embedded browsers are commonly used by app developers to display web content without having to redirect the user to heavy-weight web browsers. Just like the conventional web browsers, embedded browsers can allow the execution of web code. In addition, they provide mechanisms (viz., JavaScript bridges) to give web code access to internal app code that might implement critical functionalities and expose device resources. This is intrinsically dangerous since there is currently no means for app developers to perform origin-based access control on the JavaScript bridges, and any web code running in an embedded browser is free to use all the exposed app and device resources. Previous work that addresses this problem provided access control solutions that work only for apps that are built using hybrid frameworks. Additionally, these solutions focused on protecting only the parts of JavaScript bridges that expose permissions-protected resources. In this work, our goal is to provide a generic solution that works for all apps that utilize embedded web browsers and protects all channels that give access to internal app and device resources. Towards realizing this goal, we built Draco, a uniform and fine-grained access control framework for web code running on Android embedded browsers (viz., WebView). Draco provides a declarative policy language that allows developers to define policies to specify the desired access characteristics of web origins in a fine-grained fashion, and a runtime system that dynamically enforces the policies. In contrast with previous work, we do not assume any modifications to the Android operating system, and implement Draco in the Chromium Android System WebView app to enable seamless deployment. Our evaluation of the the Draco runtime system shows that Draco incurs negligible overhead, which is in the order of microseconds.

  As users interact with an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, they leave behind traces of information about their presence, preferences and behavior. While the ecosystem can track individuals’ movements
  to provide enhanced recommendations, individuals have little control over how this information is being used or distributed. Such tracking has led to increasing privacy concerns over the use of IoT.
  While it is possible to develop systems to enable anonymous interaction with IoT, anonymity results in limited benefits to both individuals and IoT ecosystems. In response, we present Incognito,
  a secure and privacy preserving IoT framework where user information exposure is driven by the concept of identity. In particular, we advocate user-managed identities, leaving the control of the choice
  of identity in a given context, as well as the level of exposure, in the hands of the user. Using Incognito, users can create identities that work only within certain contexts and are meaningless outside
  of these contexts. Furthermore, Incognito allows for simple management of information exposure through contextual-policies for sharing as well as querying of an IoT ecosystem. By giving individuals
  full control over the information traces that they leave behind in an IoT infrastructure, Incognito, in essence, puts individuals on equal footing with the entities that want to track their behavioral
  data. Incognito fosters a symbiotic relationship; users will need to expose information in exchange for personalized recommendations and IoT organizations who provide sophisticated user experiences
  will see enhanced user engagement.

  Yesterday Sassine Ghazi joined us as the last guest lecturer for my Stanford University cloud computing class. He's CEO of Synopsys Inc, the 14th largest software company in the world. A couple of highlights. 1) Over the past 40 years the industry can now pack 1,000,000x more transistors in the same semiconductor chip area. With this rise in complexity he talked about Re-engineering Engineering and how AI will fundamentally change hardware/chip engineering - soon. 2) His advice to students - it's a learning journey. He himself spends 15% of his personal time - learning. 3) He believes this vast buildout of centralized AI infrastructure will be used for science and engineering applications.

  You don’t normally see LLM researchers and engineers talking about their day-to-day work. Big shoutout to this YouTube video from the Anthropic LLM Interpretability team, the team behind the Golden Gate Claude. It’s amazing to see that most of the team members have worked for the team for only one year, and yet they have made such a big breakthrough in interpretability research. Another thing I want to highlight is the unique challenges facing the team and how they approach these challenges, that is, through fast trial-and-error iterations and constant evaluation of what may work and what to prioritize next.

  I'm genuinely impressed by the adoption of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting for LLMs. This technique transforms the way Large Language Models tackle complex reasoning tasks by breaking down challenges into a series of manageable steps. Instead of merely pointing LLMs to the destination, CoT provides a clear roadmap, guiding them through each twist and turn.
  Picture navigating a labyrinth. Just as one might struggle without a clear path, LLMs can falter in complex tasks without proper guidance.
  Chain of Thought prompting shines as a guiding light, leading LLMs step-by-step through the intellectual maze.
  The era of tossing a problem to an LLM and hoping for the best is behind us. CoT empowers us to dismantle intricate tasks into a sequence of logical steps, paving the way through the maze with precision.

  BadRAM in 3 Simple Steps:
  1. Compromise the memory module
  BadRAM makes the memory module intentionally lie about its size, tricking the CPU into accessing nonexistent "ghost" addresses that are silently mapped to existing memory regions.
  2. Find aliases
  Two CPU addresses now map to the same DRAM location. Our practical tools find these aliases in minutes.
  3. Bypass CPU Access Control
  Through these aliases, attackers can bypass CPU memory protections, exposing sensitive data or causing disruptions.

  When you need to play with your data in Gen Ai, you need RAG and Chunking is one of the main component in the RAG framework while consuming or processing your data.
  Excellent post below describing how in different ways chunking in RAG can be implemented..

  Nice article! I have been thinking about this exact "certificate" for a while as well, I know 2 things for certain:
  1 - Contrary to what most "AI hype maximalists" think, human-made content is going to become MORE valuable in the near future, not less. (including human-written software)
  2 - To make this certificate a killer feature, we need to provide a trust-less way to validate the authenticity of the content. I can't quite put my finger on how this would work, but I think any solution would involve cryptography and perhaps the blockchain

  I have been working at Huawei for over a year now at a team that specializes in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with Salnikov Igor, Aleksei T. and Alexander Demidovskij. During this time, we have made several publications that I would like to share with you.
  One of our recent publications relates to the topic has become particularly interesting recently because opens the door to perspective availabilities - alternatives of backpropagation. Geoffrey Hinton in his work The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigations takes a look at alternative of backpropagation based on recognition of real and fake data. We decided to focus on analysis of another part of backpropagation-less methods - biological plasticity learning rules a.k.a localized or Hebbian learning and cundacted analysis of existing localized learning efficiency. Our work Implementation Challenges and Strategies for Hebbian Learning in Convolutional Neural Networks was presented on Neuroinformatics 2023 conference and publised in Optical Memory and Neural Networks. This is an important first step for our team towards exploring neural network learning methods without using the error back propagation method.

  I just watched a summary of the new paper out of Meta entitled “Large Concept Models”. https://lnkd.in/e43n6HZg
  I’m late to the party in posting this reaction but I was immediately intrigued and have musings I wish to share.
  Does anyone remember reading Babel-17 by Roger Zelazny? It centres around the link between language and behaviour. Minds were reprogrammed using an engineered language that could force itself into the subconscious.
  It makes me wonder how many concepts humans presently possess, collectively, and from where they originate. It seems to me that some don’t rely on language to exist, e.g. objects in the world, simple emotions, physical actions.
  But then there are others which seem like they can’t exist without language to describe them, e.g. “justice”, or from para 1 of the paper “explicit higher-level semantic representation”. I understand these concepts could be constructed as combinations of simpler concepts, but is there any research out there investigating how this is done in humans and animals?
  I ask because I wonder if a LCM will be able to imagine new concepts, or will be limited by our own languages to concepts that humans have already discovered and specified? Can we apply some of the combinatorial imagination we see demonstrated in recent Large Image/Video Models to these new LCMs?

  Early this year I started to educate myself in quantum computing.
  Today I presented my progress on the field at my company eBay.
  This is a summary of what I have learned so far
