  "CVE-2017-0902": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found where rubygems did not sanitize DNS responses when requesting the hostname of the rubygems server for a domain, via a \_rubygems.\_tcp DNS SRV query. An attacker with the ability to manipulate DNS responses could direct the gem command towards a different domain.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The RubyGems client did not properly sanitize DNS responses when performing SRV lookups for gem server API discovery.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of DNS responses.",
        "Lack of hostname verification."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with the ability to manipulate DNS responses could redirect the RubyGems client to an attacker-controlled server. This could lead to arbitrary code execution by installing a malicious gem.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attack.",
        "DNS spoofing."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to manipulate DNS responses, either by performing a MITM attack or through DNS spoofing techniques. They must also have a malicious gem server ready to serve to the victim after a DNS redirection is successful.",
        "required_position": "Network adjacent to the victim or control over victim's DNS resolvers."
      },
    "affected_packages": [
      "rubygems versions prior to 2.6.13",
       "ruby versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7 and the versions of rh-ruby22-ruby and rh-ruby23-ruby as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections",
      "ruby2.1 < 2.1.5-2+deb8u4",
      "ruby2.3 < 2.3.3-1ubuntu1.3, < 2.3.1-2~16.04.6" ,
       "ruby < 2.4.2, < 2.2.8, < 2.3.5"
    ],
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered when the RubyGems client uses an SRV DNS record to discover the API endpoint of a gem server. A specially crafted DNS response can redirect the client to an attacker-controlled server. This is similar to CVE-2015-3900 and CVE-2015-4020."
