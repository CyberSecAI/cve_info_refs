  "vulnerability_information": {
    "CVE-2017-0872": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a failure to initialize the 'last_y' parameter in WebPIDecGetRGB when decoding a truncated WebP file where no rows can be decoded. Subsequently, an uninitialized value is used, potentially leading to issues when filling the remaining rows.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of uninitialized variable",
          "Improper handling of truncated WebP files"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious WebP file, causing the application to use an uninitialized value when decoding the image.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted WebP file that is truncated such that no rows can be decoded.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the malformed WebP file for processing by the affected application."
    }
