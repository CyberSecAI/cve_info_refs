{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver that could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the kernel's context.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation would allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application can exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device."
