  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2017-0402",
    "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability in the Qualcomm audio post processor could enable a local malicious application to access data outside of its permission levels. This issue is rated as Moderate because it could be used to access sensitive data without permission.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how the Equalizer command is handled, specifically how it processes indices. It is possible to use negative indices which results in out-of-bounds reads and information disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application could potentially access sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a local malicious application installed on the device."

    "patch_info": "The vulnerability is fixed by validating indices used in the Equalizer command to prevent negative indices from accessing memory out of bounds."
