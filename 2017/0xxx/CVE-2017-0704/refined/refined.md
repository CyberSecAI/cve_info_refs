Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0704:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Settings application related to setting a new parent profile password, specifically when fingerprint authentication is bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the absence of a second lock password confirmation screen when using the "Skip fingerprint" option during password setup. This allows a new password to be set without proper verification, potentially bypassing the user's desired security settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this by setting a new password for the parent profile on a device, potentially locking out the legitimate user or gaining unauthorized access. This leads to an Elevation of Privilege (EoP), as the attacker is effectively bypassing the intended authentication process.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is initiated through an `adb shell` command to launch the `SET_NEW_PARENT_PROFILE_PASSWORD` action within the Settings app. Then, by choosing to skip fingerprint setup, the attacker can set a new password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs:
1. Physical access to the device (to initiate the `adb shell` command)
2. The device must have fingerprint support.
3. The device must be set to use a password, but not fingerprint for unlocking.

In summary, this CVE describes a vulnerability that allows an attacker with physical access to bypass fingerprint lock and set a new parent profile password, leading to a moderate EoP.
