{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of .NET for DCOM, specifically the IManagedObject interface, which automatically deserializes an untrusted BinaryFormatter stream. When a .NET DCOM client connects to an untrusted endpoint, this deserialization can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unsafe deserialization of .NET objects through the BinaryFormatter",
    "Use of DCOM with .NET classes across trust boundaries",
    "Vulnerable IManagedObject interface",
    "Insufficient authentication at initial DCOM connection",
    "Use of old System.Management classes instead of Cim classes"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the machine initiating the WMI connection. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the management application, typically a high-privileged account.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Compromised WMI server sending malicious serialized objects to a client.",
     "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) or Man-At-The-Side attack to inject a malicious COM objref, redirecting the client to an attacker controlled server."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to compromise a WMI server or perform a MITM attack on a client connecting to WMI over DCOM.",
    "Ability to create a malicious .NET serialized object."
  ]
