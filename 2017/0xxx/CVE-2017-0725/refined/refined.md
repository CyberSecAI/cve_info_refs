  "CVE-2017-0725": {
    "description": "The provided text describes a fix for a vulnerability related to parsing of width and height in a frame header, where a zero value for either could cause an error. Additionally, it mentions a bug where the system attempts to read too much data from a file, leading to a crash when the header size reported by a \"BMP\" is larger than SSIZE_MAX, which could cause a crash when reading from a file. This information is related to the fix for CVE-2017-0725 according to the Android Security Bulletin.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the improper parsing of frame header width/height values and reading beyond the buffer when dealing with BMP files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Buffer Overflow",
	  "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash when parsing a specially crafted file. This occurs when width/height is 0 or when reading excessively from a file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted image file",
      "Maliciously formatted image file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted image file to a vulnerable service or application that processes it."
