Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0550:

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-0550 is a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability within the Mediaserver component of Android. It is caused by an issue in how the libavc library handles specially crafted media files and can lead to a device hang or reboot.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `libavc` library, specifically how it processes certain media files. The code commits associated with CVE-2017-0550 are linked to the fix of a memory corruption issue in libavc. This memory corruption is triggered by a specially crafted media file that exploits a flaw when handling a specific condition in the bitstream. Specifically, the fix is related to the logic that determines when a bitstream has reached the end.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of bitstream termination within libavc library
- Potential memory corruption due to crafted input, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation can cause the device to hang or reboot. This can render the device temporarily unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Specially crafted media files: The primary attack vector involves a malformed media file that, when processed by Mediaserver, triggers the vulnerability. These files could be delivered through various channels like:
    - Web browsing: Visiting a malicious website that includes the crafted media.
    - Email: Receiving an email with a malformed attachment.
    - MMS: Receiving a multimedia message with the crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to deliver a crafted media file to the target device.
- No specific privilege is required; this vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes commit messages which help in understanding the vulnerability. For example, the commit messages mention "fix in returning end of bitstream error for MBAFF", "slices should terminate on even MB boundary", and "treat that as error" - These provide strong clues about the nature of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity because of the potential for remote denial of service.
- The fix is present in AOSP versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1.

In summary, CVE-2017-0550 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Android Mediaserver due to improper bitstream handling, which can be triggered by processing a malformed media file.
