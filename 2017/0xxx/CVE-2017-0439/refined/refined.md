- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context, potentially leading to a local privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a local malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the target device.
