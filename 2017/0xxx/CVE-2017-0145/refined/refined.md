    "Summary": "The document discusses SMBv1 vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0143, CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0145, CVE-2017-0146, CVE-2017-0147, CVE-2017-0148) affecting Siemens Healthineers Molecular Diagnostics products, which use Microsoft Windows. It details that an unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code by sending crafted requests to the SMBv1 server, with the exception of CVE-2017-0147 that could lead to information disclosure with specially crafted packets by an authenticated attacker. Siemens Healthineers has developed solutions for affected products and provides mitigations, such as isolating affected products on network ports 139/tcp, 445/tcp or 3389/tcp, or operating in stand-alone mode.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is the presence of SMBv1 vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows systems used by the affected products.",

It exploits information disclosure by connecting to IPC$ and attempting a transaction on FID 0. A 'STATUS_INSUFF_SERVER_RESOURCES' response indicates vulnerability, without requiring valid SMB credentials in default configurations. The module does not provide exploit functionality itself, it is only a scanner.",

     "Summary": "This entry provides an exploit for a remote code execution vulnerability (MS17-010) in the SrvOs2FeaToNt function of Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 (x64). The vulnerability occurs due to missing boundary checks in the Srv.sys process, which results in a cross-border copy leading to arbitrary code execution. The provided python script leverages this by crafting specific SMB packets, which allows for remote code execution, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition on failed attempts.",
