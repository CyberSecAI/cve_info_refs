Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0811:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2017-0811 and its associated bug ID A-37930177, confirming its relevance.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `impel2d_dec_p_b_slice` function within the `libhevc` library. The code lacks a check for `num_mbs_left == 0` after calling the `skip_mbs` function. Even if the function should return an error, the code continues with decoding the frame and writing beyond the allocated output buffer.
*   **Weakness:** Missing check for `num_mbs_left` after calling `skip_mbs`, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted file, leading to arbitrary code execution within a privileged process (RCE).
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted media file by the affected library.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious media file that triggers the vulnerable code path. No further capabilities are mentioned.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a check for `num_mbs_left == 0` to prevent writing beyond the allocated buffer.
* The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" due to its ability to execute arbitrary code and is applicable across several Android versions (5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0).
* The provided code commits show that this is a fix for a memory overflow error in the libhevc library.
* Another provided commit is also related, addressing a different issue in the same library: Ensuring that the CTB size > 16 for clips with tiles and width/height >= 4096. When these conditions are met, a CTB size of 16 can result in tile position > 255, which is not supported by the decoder and would lead to a crash.
