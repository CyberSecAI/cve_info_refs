{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NVIDIA kernel driver's i2c-hid driver allows an attacker to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary memory location.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary memory write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Escalation of privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs local access to the vulnerable device."
