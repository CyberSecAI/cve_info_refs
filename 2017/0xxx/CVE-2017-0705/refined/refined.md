    "CVE-2017-0705": {
      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `GSCAN_ATTRIBUTE_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_BSSIDS` attribute within the nl80211 driver when the `GSCAN_SUBCMD_SET_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_CONFIG` command is used. Specifically, the code does not properly validate the size and structure of nested attributes within the `GSCAN_ATTRIBUTE_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_BSSIDS` attribute, leading to potential buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code lacks proper bounds checking and validation when parsing nested attributes within the `GSCAN_ATTRIBUTE_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_BSSIDS` attribute. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious netlink message with a large number of nested attributes or incorrect sizes of nested attributes that can cause a heap buffer overflow.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of this vulnerability allows a proximate attacker to achieve an elevation of privilege. Specifically, by crafting a malicious netlink message, they can cause memory corruption in the kernel, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel's context.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted netlink message to the nl80211 driver using the `GSCAN_SUBCMD_SET_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_CONFIG` command, with the vulnerable `GSCAN_ATTRIBUTE_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_BSSIDS` containing many or improperly sized nested attributes.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to communicate with the nl80211 driver. This typically implies a local user or process that has network access to the device's Wi-Fi interface. The attacker does not need to have root privileges initially but will gain these privileges due to the memory corruption."
