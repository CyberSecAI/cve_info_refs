{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-0483",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the Media Framework handles malformed bistreams during decoding, specifically within the `avc_utils` component.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The decoder does not gracefully handle malformed bistreams, leading to an issue during initialization.",
        "An empty NAL unit may not be properly handled, potentially causing incorrect state during decoding."
      ],
      "impact": "A denial-of-service vulnerability could be triggered by using a specially crafted bistream, causing the device to hang or reboot.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malformed media file provided via email, web browsing, or MMS can trigger the vulnerability.",
         "Specifically, a crafted AVC bistream will cause a crash in Mediaserver"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malformed media file to the vulnerable device.",
      "additional_details": "The fix addresses an error condition that occurs when the number of MBs decoded in the current frame is zero. The vulnerability is related to an unnecessary decrement of MB info in a multi-core case when an error is detected."
