Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0089:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `USP10!UpdateGlyphFlags` function within the Windows Uniscribe library. A corrupted font file triggers an out-of-bounds write in the heap during glyph processing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds write. This occurs when the `UpdateGlyphFlags` function attempts to write to memory outside of an allocated heap buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds write leads to a crash, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted, corrupted font file is used as the attack vector.
- The font file triggers a heap out-of-bounds write when processed by the Uniscribe library.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when displaying text using the corrupted font. This could be through various Windows applications or system components that rely on Uniscribe for text rendering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious font file for the system to process. This could be achieved through a website, email attachment, or other methods of delivering files to the target system.
- No special user privileges are explicitly needed, though triggering the vulnerability may require displaying the malicious font using a program that uses Uniscribe functionality, possibly requiring some user interaction.
