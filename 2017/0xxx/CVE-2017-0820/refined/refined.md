Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located within the `libhevc` component of the Android media framework, specifically within the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) library. The provided commit message indicates a fix within the `platform/external/libhevc` project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is categorized as "NSI" (Not Specified) which means there isn't enough information to accurately classify the vulnerability type. The impact is potentially a denial of service (DoS). There was a high severity denial of service vulnerability in older android versions (4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service condition on a vulnerable Android device. This could lead to the device becoming unresponsive or crashing, disrupting normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would likely involve providing a specially crafted HEVC video file or stream to the device. When the media framework attempts to decode this malicious content using the vulnerable `libhevc` library, it could trigger the denial-of-service condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need the ability to deliver the specially crafted media content to the target device. This could be achieved through various means, such as:

*   Embedding the malicious media in a website.
*   Sending the malicious media as an attachment in a messaging app.
*   Including the malicious media in an app installed by the user.

The attacker needs no special privileges on the device.
