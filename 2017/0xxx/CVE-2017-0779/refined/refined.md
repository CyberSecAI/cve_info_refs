Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to a memory allocation issue in AudioFlinger. Specifically, when handling client-less tracks, there's a potential for incorrect memory management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Memory Allocation:** The core issue appears to be a flaw in how AudioFlinger allocates memory for client-less tracks. This can lead to either a buffer overflow or use-after-free scenario. 
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability is classified as Information Disclosure, meaning that an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, possibly from the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is information disclosure, where an attacker could read data from the application's memory.
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):** As noted in the bulletin, under some circumstances (specifically, Android versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1), this can lead to a denial-of-service condition (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Specially crafted audio file:** The vulnerability can be triggered via processing a specially crafted audio file, which can then lead to the memory corruption.
-  **Local Attack:** While the bulletin also mentions "remote attacker", the specific vulnerability detailed in the provided commit logs seems to be triggered via local means through a crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted audio file to trigger the vulnerability.
- While a local attack is implied, the bulletin suggests a remote attacker may trigger this as well.
- The ability to send the malicious file via media processing or by other means is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves checking the buffer size of static tracks, implying a size check was missing or inadequate.
- Multiple AOSP versions are affected, from 4.4.4 to 7.1.2.
- The vulnerability is fixed by commit `ff4c8310ab7976ea9930b1dc4e3383720d5b5a8d` and `b58464fa783c75ba9d304f670a4392df6fa98ed8` in AOSP.
- It appears that the initial vulnerability was a memory allocation issue related to client-less audio tracks.
