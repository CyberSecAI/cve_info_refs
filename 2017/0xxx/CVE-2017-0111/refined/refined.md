{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple crashes in the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library when displaying text using a corrupted font file or calling documented Uniscribe API functions against such malformed fonts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds reads",
      "Wild memory reads"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to crashes, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By using a custom program that displays all of the font's glyphs at various point sizes, and additionally calls some of the Uniscribe-specific API functions using corrupted font files.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to display text with a custom program using malformed font files."
  },
  "additional_information": "The crashes occur at various locations in the Uniscribe library, specifically during operations like glyph substitution, positioning, and table lookups, making it hard to assess the root cause and impact of each crash individually. The issues reproduce on Windows 7 and it's recommended to enable PageHeap to get reliable repros."
