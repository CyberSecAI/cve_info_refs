Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0678:

**CVE-2017-0678**

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of metadata in the media framework. Specifically, the issue lies in how the system handles character data after metadata updates.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process by sending a specially crafted file.
* **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, requiring the attacker to send a specially crafted file to the affected device.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted file to the target device. This could be achieved through various means, including malicious websites, emails, or messaging apps.

**Technical Details:**
The fix involves modifying the `MetaData` handling to invalidate previously used character data after a metadata update. This prevents the use of outdated or corrupted data which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. Specifically, the commit message mentions "Modifying MetaData invalidates previous char*" and also addresses a bug with ID 36576151.
The provided code diff indicates that this commit fixes a bug related to memory handling within the media framework.
