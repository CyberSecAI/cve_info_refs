Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-0123 (This is confirmed by the included link to the NVD page for this CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple heap out-of-bounds and wild reads in the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library when processing corrupted font files. The crashes are caused by invalid memory READ accesses within the Uniscribe library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Heap Out-of-bounds read
*   Wild reads

**Impact of Exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) via application crash due to memory access violations. This is explicitly stated in the "Type" field as "dos". The content also mentions the crashes occur at page boundaries and non-mapped addresses.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Processing of a malformed font file.
*   Calling documented Uniscribe API functions against such malformed fonts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious font file to an application that uses the Uniscribe library to display text, or be able to manipulate the API calls to Uniscribe to trigger the vulnerability. The content specifies that a custom program is required to fully exploit the vulnerability that displays all of the font's glyphs at various point sizes, and additionally calls some of the Uniscribe-specific API functions.

**Additional Details:**
*   The content mentions multiple crash locations, with a list of 27 identified in the Uniscribe library (USP10.dll).
*   The issues were discovered through fuzzing.
*   The vulnerabilities were confirmed to reproduce on Windows 7.
*   PageHeap was advised to be enabled to get reliable reproductions.
*   A proof-of-concept is available in the form of a zipped archive.
*   This vulnerability is one of many addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-011.
