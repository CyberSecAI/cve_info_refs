**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1078

We have discovered two bugs in the implementation of the win32k!NtGdiGetDIBitsInternal system call, which is a part of the graphic subsystem in all modern versions of Windows. The issues can potentially lead to kernel pool memory disclosure (bug #1) or denial of service (bug #1 and #2). Under certain circumstances, memory corruption could also be possible.

----------[ Double-fetch while handling the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure ]----------

At the beginning of the win32k!NtGdiGetDIBitsInternal system call handler, the code references the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure (and specifically its .biSize field) several times, in order to correctly calculate its size and capture it into kernel-mode memory. A pseudo-code representation of the relevant code is shown below, where "bmi" is a user-controlled address:

--- cut ---
  ProbeForRead(bmi, 4, 1);
  ProbeForWrite(bmi, bmi->biSize, 1); <------------ Fetch #1

  header_size = GreGetBitmapSize(bmi); <----------- Fetch #2
  captured_bmi = Alloc(header_size);

  ProbeForRead(bmi, header_size, 1);
  memcpy(captured_bmi, bmi, header_size); <-------- Fetch #3

  new_header_size = GreGetBitmapSize(bmi);
  if (header_size != new_header_size) {
    // Bail out.
  }

  // Process the data further.
--- cut ---

In the snippet above, we can see that the user-mode "bmi" buffer is accessed thrice: when accessing the biSize field, in the GreGetBitmapSize() call, and in the final memcpy() call. While this is clearly a multi-fetch condition, it is mostly harmless: since there is a ProbeForRead() call for "bmi", it must be a user-mode address, so bypassing the subsequent ProbeForWrite() call by setting bmi->biSize to 0 doesn't change much. Furthermore, since the two results of the GreGetBitmapSize() calls are eventually compared, introducing any inconsistencies in between them is instantly detected.

As far as we are concerned, the only invalid outcome of the behavior could be read access to out-of-bounds pool memory in the second GreGetBitmapSize() call. This is achieved in the following way:

1. Invoke NtGdiGetDIBitsInternal with a structure having the biSize field set to 12 (sizeof(BITMAPCOREHEADER)).
2. The first call to GreGetBitmapSize() now returns 12 or a similar small value.
3. This number of bytes is allocated for the header buffer.
4. (In a second thread) Change the value of the biSize field to 40 (sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER)) before the memcpy() call.
5. memcpy() copies the small structure (with incorrectly large biSize) into the pool allocation.
6. When called again, the GreGetBitmapSize() function assumes that the biSize field is set adequately to the size of the corresponding memory area (untrue), and attempts to access structure fields at offsets greater than 12.

The bug is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for win32k.sys, as the invalid memory read will then be reliably detected and will yield a system bugcheck. An excerpt from a kernel crash log triggered using the bug in question is shown below:

--- cut ---
  DRIVER_PAGE_FAULT_BEYOND_END_OF_ALLOCATION (d6)
  N bytes of memory was allocated and more than N bytes are being referenced.
  This cannot be protected by try-except.
  When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
  the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.

The out-of-bounds data read by GreGetBitmapSize() could then be extracted back to user-mode to some degree, which could help disclose sensitive data or defeat certain kernel security mitigations (such as kASLR).

Attached is a PoC program for Windows 7 32-bit (double_fetch_oob_read.cpp).

----------[ Unhandled out-of-bounds write to user-mode memory when requesting RLE-compressed bitmaps ]----------

The 5th parameter of the NtGdiGetDIBitsInternal syscall is a pointer to an output buffer where the bitmap data should be written to. The length of the buffer is specified in the 8th parameter, and can be optionally 0. The logic of sanitizing and locking the memory area is shown below ("Buffer" is the 5th argument and "Length" is the 8th).

--- cut ---
  if (Length != 0 || (Length = GreGetBitmapSize(bmi)) != 0) {
    ProbeForWrite(Buffer, Length, 4);
    MmSecureVirtualMemory(Buffer, Length, PAGE_READWRITE);
  }
--- cut ---

We can see that if the "Length" argument is non-zero, it is prioritized over the result of GreGetBitmapSize() in specifying how many bytes of the user-mode output buffer should be locked in memory as readable/writeable. Since the two calls above are supposed to guarantee that the required user-mode memory region will be accessible until it is unlocked, the call to the GreGetDIBitsInternal() function which actually fills the buffer with data is not guarded with a try/except block.

However, if we look into GreGetDIBitsInternal() and further into GreGetDIBitsInternalWorker(), we can see that if a RLE-compressed bitmap is requested by the user (as indicated by bmi.biCompression set to BI_RLE[4,8]), the internal EncodeRLE4() and EncodeRLE8() routines are responsible for writing the output data. The legal size of the buffer is passed through the functions' 5th parameter (last one), and is always set to bmi.biSizeImage. This creates a discrepancy: a different number of bytes is ensured to be present in memory (Length), and a different number can be actually written to it (bmi.biSizeImage). Due to the lack of exception handling in this code area, the resulting exception causes a system-wide bugcheck:

--- cut ---
  KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (8e)
  This is a very common bugcheck.  Usually the exception address pinpoints
  the driver/function that caused the problem.  Always note this address
  as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.
  Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.  This means a hard
  coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted
  /NODEBUG.  This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have
  hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...
  If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the
  system is booted /DEBUG.  This will let us see why this breakpoint is
  happening.
  Arguments:
  Arg1: c0000005, The exception code that was not handled
  Arg2: 9461564b, The address that the exception occurred at
  Arg3: 9d0539a0, Trap Frame

While the size of the buffer passed to EncodeRLE[4,8] can be arbitrarily controlled through bmi.biSizeImage (32-bit field), it doesn't enable an attacker to corrupt kernel-mode memory, as the memory writing takes place sequentially from the beginning to the end of the buffer. Furthermore, since the code in NtGdiGetDIBitsInternal() makes sure that the buffer size passed to ProbeForWrite() is >= 1, its base address must reside in user space. As such, this appears to be a DoS issue only, if we haven't missed anything in our analysis.

Attached is a PoC program for Windows 7 32-bit (usermode_oob_write.cpp), and a bitmap file necessary for the exploit to work (test.bmp).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
