The provided content is related to CVE-2017-0905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability present in the `Resource#find` method of the `recurly-client-ruby` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `Resource#find` method in `lib/recurly/resource.rb` accepted a `uuid` parameter which could be a URL. If the `uuid` started with `http`, the method would use it as the URI for the request, without proper validation, leading to an SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make requests to internal resources that are not directly accessible to the outside world and potentially gain access to sensitive data, or execute internal functions.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious URL and pass it as the `uuid` parameter to the `Resource#find` method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have the ability to control or influence the `uuid` parameter passed to the `Resource#find` method. This would likely require the ability to call the affected API endpoint.
