  "cve": "CVE-2017-0397",
  "description": "The provided text discusses a vulnerability related to parsing MP3 album art information in Stagefright. It involves using strlen() to parse user-supplied strings, which may be unterminated, leading to reading beyond the buffer's end.",
  "affected_versions": "Android versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1.",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `strlen()` to parse user-supplied strings in the MP3 album art parsing code within Stagefright. If these strings are not properly null-terminated, `strlen()` will read past the end of the buffer.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper bounds checking",
    "Use of strlen() on potentially unterminated strings"
  ],
  "impact": "The primary impact is an information disclosure vulnerability, allowing a malicious application to access sensitive data outside of its permission levels. This could potentially lead to more serious exploitation.",
  "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing user-provided MP3 files, which may contain specially crafted album art metadata.",
  "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted MP3 file to the vulnerable device, potentially through local storage or a media sharing service.",
  "additional_information": "The fix involves replacing `strlen()` with `strnlen()` for 8-bit encodings and strengthening the parsing of 16-bit encodings. Additionally, the code was reworked to better handle buffer boundaries and prevent over-reads. The vulnerability is described in the 2017-01-01 Android Security Bulletin as a moderate information disclosure issue."
