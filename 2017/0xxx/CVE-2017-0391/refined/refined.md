Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0391:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content, particularly the commit message from android.googlesource.com, directly references bug ID 32322258 which is associated with CVE-2017-0391 in the Android Security Bulletin. The commit message describes handling of invalid slice addresses in slice headers, which, if parsed, could result in an incomplete slice header during the decode stage. The fix was to avoid incrementing slice_idx for ignored slice errors. This aligns with the official description for CVE-2017-0391 provided in the Android Security Bulletin, which states: "A denial of service vulnerability in Mediaserver could enable a remote attacker to use a specially crafted file to cause a device hang or reboot." The vulnerability is located in the libhevc library.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The root cause is improper handling of invalid `slice_address` within HEVC slice headers during the decoding process in the libhevc library.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The decoder was not properly validating slice addresses. Specifically, when an invalid slice_address was parsed, it lead to an incomplete slice header.
    *  **Incomplete slice header**: When an invalid slice address was parsed, the decoder was incrementing the slice index (slice_idx), this caused an incomplete slice header during the decode stage.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a device hang or reboot due to the incomplete slice header, causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Specially crafted media files:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a crafted HEVC media file containing an invalid slice address.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability can be triggered via a specially crafted media file.
    * **Ability to deliver the crafted file:** The attacker needs the capability to deliver or have the device process a malicious HEVC file.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The provided commit messages indicate that the fix involves not incrementing the slice index (`slice_idx`) when a slice error is ignored. This prevents the creation of incomplete slice headers.
*   The vulnerability affects all Android versions from 6.0 to 7.1.1

**In summary:** CVE-2017-0391 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Android libhevc library where parsing an invalid slice address in the HEVC file during decode stage results in an incomplete slice header leading to device hanging/reboot. This can be exploited remotely by an attacker providing a specially crafted media file. The fix is to avoid incrementing slice_idx for ignored slice errors.
