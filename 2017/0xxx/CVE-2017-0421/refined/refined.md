Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-0421:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks when an application sends or receives content change notifications related to content providers.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is the absence of checks to ensure that an app has the necessary access level to the underlying content provider before receiving or sending change notifications.
- **Information Disclosure:**  A malicious application can exploit this flaw to eavesdrop on sensitive user data from the notifications of otherwise private content providers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** A malicious application can potentially gain access to sensitive user data by intercepting content change notifications from private content providers, which it would normally not have permission to access. This could include personal information, app data, or other protected content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector involves a locally installed malicious application.
- **Content Change Notification System:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Android system's content change notification mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
- The attacker does not require any special permissions beyond the ability to install and run an app, and to register for receiving content change notifications.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves requiring apps to have some level of access to the underlying content provider in order to either send or receive content change notifications.
- The commit message mentions that without these checks, a malicious app could "sniff sensitive user data from the notifications of otherwise private providers."

**Additional Information:**
- The fix is associated with Android bug ID A-32555637 and change ID If2dcd45cb0a9f1fb3b93e39fc7b8ae9c34c2fdef.
- This vulnerability is rated as 'High' severity.
- It affects a wide range of Android versions (5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1).

This vulnerability is related to an information disclosure and not remote code execution.
