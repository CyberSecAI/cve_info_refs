Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-0062

**Root Cause:**
- A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `USP10!ScriptApplyLogicalWidth` function within the Windows Uniscribe library. This occurs when processing a malformed Enhanced Metafile (EMF) file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability stems from an attempt to read memory outside the allocated bounds within the heap. This is triggered when a malformed EMF file is processed by the Uniscribe library. Specifically, the code attempts to access `dword ptr [eax+edi*4]`, where the calculated address goes beyond the valid memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a crash due to an access violation. This can cause the application or system to become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious EMF File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted or malformed EMF file to an application that utilizes GDI+ or Uniscribe for rendering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to deliver the crafted EMF file:** An attacker would need to be able to get the vulnerable application to process a malicious EMF file. This could be through various methods such as:
    - Embedding it within a document (e.g., Word, Office document).
    - Hosting it on a website and tricking a user to open it in a browser.
    - Sending the file via email and getting the user to open it.
- **No special privileges are needed:** The vulnerability exists within user-mode code.
- **Knowledge of GDI+ or Uniscribe API:** An attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious EMF file that would trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was found using Project Zero (Google Security Research).
- The provided crash analysis highlights the out-of-bounds read at the address `751e6f3c` within `USP10!ScriptApplyLogicalWidth`.
- The proof of concept is available at the provided link, demonstrating that the issue is reproducible.
- The vulnerability is easiest to trigger with PageHeap enabled, indicating a potential issue with memory management.
- It is reproducible on Windows 7 and likely affects other versions using the vulnerable component.
