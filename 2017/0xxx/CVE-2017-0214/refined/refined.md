{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Running Object Table (ROT) handles the ROTFLAGS_ALLOWANYCLIENT flag and AppID settings during COM object registration. Specifically, it allows a normal user process to register a global ROT entry that should only be allowed for Local Service or RunAs applications by manipulating the AppID.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Access Control: The ROT allows any process, even sandboxed ones, to register a global ROT entry by setting an appropriate AppID.",
    "Type Library Spoofing: The vulnerability leverages the way LoadTypeLib handles failures by falling back to monikers, which allows an attacker to redirect a type library load to a malicious implementation.",
    "COM Stub/Proxy Abuse: By forcing the use of a malicious type library in the creation of COM stubs/proxies for dual automation interfaces, the attacker can cause memory safety issues."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of privilege from a normal user or even a sandboxed process to a higher privilege context by spoofing a type library and causing a more privileged process to use the attacker's implementation, which leads to memory corruption, arbitrary memory read/writes, and the ability to extend the vtable to call arbitrary functions. In the provided proof of concept, this leads to a crash in the Windows Search service, but could allow for full code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by running a malicious process that registers a ROT entry for a type library, and then forces a higher privileged process to load the type library which is redirected to the malicious implementation. This includes injecting into a RunAs COM process, or manipulating the AppId.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system as a normal user, even inside a sandbox. The attacker also needs to be able to create an ROT entry, lock parts of files, and set up a fake type library."
