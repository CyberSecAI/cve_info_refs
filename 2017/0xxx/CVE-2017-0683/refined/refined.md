{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The soft_avc encoder caches buffer sizes across a point where the sizes could be reset by an app, allowing crafted requests to hit outside of the current buffer. ",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker using a specially crafted file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a crafted file as input."
