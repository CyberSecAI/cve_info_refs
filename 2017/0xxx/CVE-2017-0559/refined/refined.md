Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0559:

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-0559 is an information disclosure vulnerability found in the `libskia` library of Android. This vulnerability can be exploited by a local malicious application to access data beyond its intended permission level.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds memory read vulnerability exists within `libskia`. Specifically, when decoding GIF images, the code does not properly check if an index is within range before attempting to copy data, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is a classic out-of-bounds read, which occurs when a program tries to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious application could read sensitive data from other parts of memory that it shouldn't have access to. This bypasses operating system protections designed to isolate app data.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Local Malicious Application:** A local application installed on the Android device could exploit this flaw. The application would need the ability to process crafted GIF images to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the targeted device.
    *   The application needs to be able to trigger the processing of specially crafted GIF images, likely through a library that calls the vulnerable code in `libskia`.

**Technical Details:**

The provided git commit message further clarifies the issue:
```
Fix out of bounds memory read in GIFMovie.cpp

When decoding a GIF image, do not attempt to copy an index if it is out
of range.

BUG: 33897722
Change-Id: I8c8ca69b00bf1f655e62bbe1798b9a47bf6699be
```
This shows that the fix involved adding a check to prevent the out-of-bounds access when an index within the GIF is invalid.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity. This seems to be because the exploit requires a local malicious application.
*   The fix is available in AOSP versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1. This indicates that the issue has a broad range of impact across Android versions.
* The fix was reported on Dec 25, 2016, as part of the Android Security Bulletin for April 2017.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, potential impact and how an attacker could exploit it.
