Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0306:

**Verification:**

The content from `nvidia.custhelp.com` directly mentions "CVE-2017-0306: NVIDIA Tegra kernel driver contains a vulnerability in NVHOST where an input buffer is copied to an output buffer without checking the size of the input buffer, which may lead to denial of service." This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the NVIDIA Tegra kernel driver's NVHOST component. Specifically, an input buffer is copied to an output buffer without verifying if the size of the input buffer is appropriate for the destination buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability. By providing a larger-than-expected input buffer, an attacker can overwrite memory beyond the boundaries of the allocated output buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The absence of a check on the input buffer size before copying is the direct cause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most likely outcome of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. Memory corruption can lead to system instability, causing the device to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device, though not necessarily requiring elevated privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerability exists within the `NVHOST` component of the NVIDIA Tegra kernel driver.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 9.3, indicating a critical severity. However, it has a Temporal Score of 7.8.
*   **Affected Products:** Jetson TK1 and Jetson TX1 (R21 and R24) are listed as vulnerable.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-0306 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the NVIDIA Tegra kernel driver caused by missing input size validation during buffer copying. It can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability is local to the device.
