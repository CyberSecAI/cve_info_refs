{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs in the `USP10!otlReverseChainingLookup::apply` function within the Windows Uniscribe library due to a corrupted TTF font file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds memory read. The function attempts to read a word from a memory address derived from a malformed font file, leading to an access violation if that address is invalid.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash in the Uniscribe library. There is a potential for disclosing sensitive data from the process heap.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through displaying text using a specially crafted, corrupted TTF font file. This can be achieved through a program that displays font glyphs.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malformed TTF font file to a user or application which uses Uniscribe to render text. The user must then use an application to display text using the malicious font."
