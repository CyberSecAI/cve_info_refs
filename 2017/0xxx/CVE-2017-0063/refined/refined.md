    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A malformed color profile file leads to an out-of-bounds read within the `icm32!LHCalc3toX_Di16_Do16_Lut8_G32` function of the Windows Color Management library (icm32.dll).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The out-of-bounds read leads to a crash in the application, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed color profile file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted color profile file that can be loaded by the application. This can be achieved by convincing the user to open the file with a vulnerable application or by exploiting a different vulnerability that allows the attacker to load the file without user interaction."
