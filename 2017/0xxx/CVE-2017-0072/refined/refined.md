Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2017-0072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `USP10!FillAlternatesList` function within the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library.
- The root cause is a buffer overflow due to the function attempting to write more data into a buffer than the allocated size allows. Specifically, while requesting a list of alternate glyphs for a specific glyph in a corrupted font file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The `USP10!FillAlternatesList` function does not respect the `cMaxAlternates` parameter provided by the caller (`ScriptGetFontAlternateGlyphs`), causing it to write beyond the bounds of the provided output buffer (`pAlternateGlyphs`).
- **Incorrect bounds checking:** The API function fails to perform proper bounds checking of the maximum number of alternate glyphs, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow leads to corruption of various memory areas, potentially including stack, heap, and static memory, depending on where the output buffer is allocated.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash observed in the provided crash log and the identified memory corruption indicate a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Font File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed font file that causes the `USP10!FillAlternatesList` function to attempt to write an excessive amount of data to the output buffer.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user or an application to load and process the malicious font file, which then triggers the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create a malicious font file:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious font file that causes the vulnerability.
- **Ability to entice a user or application into processing the malicious font file:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious font file to the target environment and have it processed by a vulnerable application. This can be achieved via multiple methods, including but not limited to:
    - Web browsing where a font is used
    - Opening a document that uses a malicious font.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is easily reproducible with PageHeap enabled.
- The issue was discovered by Google Security Research.
- The vulnerability affects Windows 7, but it may also affect other versions of Windows.
- A proof-of-concept malformed font file is available to reproduce the crash.
