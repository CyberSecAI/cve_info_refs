{
  "Root cause": "The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) does not properly handle authentication requests.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Denial of service vulnerability due to improper handling of authentication requests by LSASS."
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation could cause a denial of service on the target system's LSASS service, triggering an automatic system reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted authentication request to trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the target system; no specific authentication is required."
}
