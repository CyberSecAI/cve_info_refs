Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0735:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of SPS (Sequence Parameter Set) parameters within the libavc library during video decoding. Specifically, the code used outdated SPS parameters to detect changes in resolution, leading to issues when multiple SPS IDs were encountered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect parameter usage:** The decoder used previous SPS parameters instead of the current ones, leading to a hang when handling multiple SPS IDs.
- **Potential for Denial of Service (DoS):** The incorrect SPS parameter handling could cause the video decoding process to hang, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service condition due to a hang in the video decoding process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted video files that contain multiple SPS IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious video file to the vulnerable device, which can be achieved through various means, including malicious websites, apps, or files.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix involves using the current SPS parameters from the decoder context to detect resolution/SPS changes.
- The issue was found by running Proof-of-Concept (POC) tests on an AddressSanitizer (ASAN)-enabled build before/after patching.
- Two commits are associated with fixing this issue:
