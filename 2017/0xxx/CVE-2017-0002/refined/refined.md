Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Edge's improper enforcement of cross-domain policies when dealing with `about:blank`. This allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions that normally prevent scripts from one domain from accessing or modifying content from another domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-domain policy bypass:** Microsoft Edge does not properly handle cross-domain policies for `about:blank` which results in a security flaw. Specifically, the browser does not assign a unique origin to top-level windows that navigate to Data URLs, which then allows an attacker to inject content from one domain into another.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** By exploiting the cross-domain policy bypass, an attacker can potentially elevate their privileges within the browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Elevation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to an attacker gaining elevated privileges within Microsoft Edge. This means they could potentially perform actions they would normally not be authorized to do.
- **Information Access:** An attacker could access information from one domain and inject it into another, potentially leading to data theft or manipulation, and could potentially perform actions that they are not allowed to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Websites that have been compromised, or that host user provided content can be used to serve the malicious content.
- **User Interaction:** Attackers would need to trick the user into visiting the attacker-controlled content, e.g. via a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to host a website or inject malicious content into a website.
- The attacker would require that a user of Microsoft Edge navigates to the page containing the malicious content.
