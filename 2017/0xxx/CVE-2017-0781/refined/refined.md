    "summary": "CVE-2017-0781 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Android Bluetooth subsystem. An attacker within close proximity can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious crafted Bluetooth packets, leading to arbitrary code execution within a privileged process. The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks or handling of data in the Bluetooth stack, which can cause memory corruption. Patches released address this by implementing proper handling of data and buffer allocation in the Bluetooth stack."
