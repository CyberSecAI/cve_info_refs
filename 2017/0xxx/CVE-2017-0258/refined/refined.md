  "CVE-2017-0258": {
    "description": "The kernel-mode structure containing the default DACL of system processes' tokens has 8 uninitialized bytes at the end. The size of the structure (ACL.AclSize) is larger than the sum of ACE lengths (ACE_HEADER.AceSize). It is possible to read the leftover pool data using a GetTokenInformation(TokenDefaultDacl) call.",
    "root_cause": "The kernel-mode structure containing the default DACL of system processes' tokens has 8 uninitialized bytes at the end because the size of the structure is larger than the sum of ACE lengths.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel memory disclosure. Allows local authenticated attackers to defeat certain exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to obtain SeDebugPrivilege. The attacker needs to be able to make a `GetTokenInformation(TokenDefaultDacl)` call to read the uninitialized memory.",
    "more_details": "The proof of concept code is provided and shows how to read the uninitialized memory by calling GetTokenInformation(TokenDefaultDacl) on the token of a system process. When Special Pools are enabled for ntoskrnl.exe, the uninitialized bytes are shown to be leftover pool data (0x01 bytes which are markers inserted by Special Pools). It is noted that while reading DACLs of system processes may require special privileges, the root cause could allow creation of uninitialized DACLs easily accessible by regular users."
