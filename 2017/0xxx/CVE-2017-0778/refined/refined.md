      "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the MPEG4Extractor when checking size for yrr box.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service or information disclosure. The vulnerability can lead to a crash if exploited. ",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted media file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file.",
        "More details": "The vulnerability is triggered by a size check for the yrr box in the MPEG4Extractor. An integer overflow can occur if a large size value is provided, leading to incorrect memory calculations. This can result in memory corruption and a crash, which could be exploited to achieve a denial-of-service condition or information disclosure."
