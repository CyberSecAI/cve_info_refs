Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is located in the media framework, specifically related to MPEG2 handling. The commit message indicates an issue with "MPEG2 reinit Error Handling." It appears that there was a scenario where an error during initialization was not being properly handled, leading to a potential vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper error handling during MPEG2 reinitialization.
- Failure to appropriately notify errors, potentially leading to an exploitable state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability is categorized as critical, meaning a remote attacker could leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This allows the attacker to gain significant control over the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted media file (likely MPEG2) to an Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send a malicious media file to the target device. This could be done through various means like:
    - Sending an MMS message with the crafted file.
    - Hosting the file on a website and tricking the user into downloading or playing it.
    - Using other methods of delivering the malicious content through a network.
- The attacker can be remote; physical access to the device is not required for the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, and 7.1.2.
- The fix involves ensuring that errors are correctly identified and handled during MPEG2 initialization. It prevents further processing when a fatal error occurs to avoid exploitation.
- The vulnerability was reported by Zinuo Han and Zhe Jin of Chengdu Security Response Center, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.

This vulnerability is considered critical because of the high potential for attackers to gain complete remote control of the device, and the wide range of Android versions affected.
