Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-0901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of gem names during the installation process within RubyGems versions prior to 2.6.13. Specifically, the `name` field in the gem specification was not validated allowing a malicious crafted gem could use directory traversal metacharacters such as `..`. This allowed for the potential to write files outside the intended gem installation directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** RubyGems did not properly validate or sanitize the `name` field of a gem specification, allowing for the inclusion of directory traversal characters like `..`.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Due to the lack of sanitization, a specially crafted gem could write to arbitrary locations on the file system, allowing for file creation and overwriting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite**: An attacker could overwrite files outside the gem installation directory.
*   **Remote Code Execution**: By overwriting critical files on the system with malicious content, attackers can potentially gain remote code execution (indirectly).
*   **Denial of Service**: An attacker may replace essential application files to cause an application or the system to be unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Gem Packages:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious actor creating a specially crafted gem package with a manipulated `name` field containing directory traversal characters (e.g., `../`).
*  **Entice Victim:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to install the malicious gem. This can be done by hosting the malicious gem in a third party repository or man in the middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Gems:** The attacker needs the capability to create gem packages and control the gem specification.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to get a user (or process) to install the malicious gem via the gem command line tool.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable code exists in the RubyGems installer component where the gem names are not sanitized before writing the gem to disk.
*   The exploit relies on a lack of a check on `name` field of the gem.
*   The attacker can use `../` metacharacters in the `name` field to traverse up the directory structure.

**Additional details from content:**

* The vulnerability was fixed in RubyGems 2.6.13.
* Patches have been created to address this issue in various products that use RubyGems, including Red Hat Software Collections, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Debian.
* Red Hat rated this with a "Moderate" security impact.
* Affected products included Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, Red Hat Software Collections, and other distributions like Ubuntu.
* An attacker can cause a denial of service attack against RubyGems clients by sending a specially crafted gem.
* Versions of ruby 2.2.8, 2.3.5 and 2.4.2 also needed to be patched.
