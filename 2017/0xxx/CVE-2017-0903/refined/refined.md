{
  "CVE-2017-0903": {
    "Root cause": "The rubygems module was vulnerable to an unsafe YAML deserialization when inspecting a gem.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe object deserialization",
      "YAML deserialization can bypass class white lists"
    ],
    "Impact": "Applications inspecting gem files without installing them can be tricked to execute arbitrary code in the context of the ruby interpreter, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted gem with a malicious YAML formatted gem specification",
      "Applications parsing gem files without installing them are vulnerable."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious gem and have it processed by a vulnerable application."
  }
