Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0591:

**CVE-2017-0591**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A memory corruption vulnerability exists within the `libavc` library, specifically during the processing of AVC (Advanced Video Coding) video data. The issue arises when handling dangling fields with gaps in frames, where the field pic in cur_slice was incorrectly set to 0.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Memory corruption occurs when the video decoder processes specially crafted video data, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution within the context of the `mediaserver` process. This process runs with elevated privileges, allowing a compromised process to potentially cause further harm to the system. The impact is categorized as Critical due to the potential for remote code execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted video file (e.g., via email, MMS, or a web browser) to a vulnerable device. The device would then process the malicious data, triggering the memory corruption.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted AVC video file to the target device.
    *   No user interaction is needed other than the device processing the malformed video file (automatically, in the background).
    *   No special privileges or local access is required by the attacker.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `libavc` library, which is responsible for decoding AVC video streams.
*   The fix involves a change to the handling of dangling fields, ensuring that `field_pic` is correctly set.
*   The fix ensures proper handling of SPS parsing, ensuring that errors are returned if more bytes than expected are read.
*   The fix is included in the Android security patch level of 2017-05-01 or later.
