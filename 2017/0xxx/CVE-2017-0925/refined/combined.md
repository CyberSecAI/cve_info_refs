# API exposes plain text password for service integrations

### Summary

API endpoint for project service integration exposes password in plain text.
When querying API described in below document:

<https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/services.html#create-edit-jira-service>

Plain text password for defined integration is shown.
This was checked only on JIRA integration as this is only we use in our project.

### Steps to reproduce

Create JIRA service integration then query it via API.

### Example Project

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Integration password is exposed.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Password should be obfusced / removed from API output.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

### Output of checks
