Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0925:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an API endpoint that, when queried, exposes the plain text password of a configured service integration (specifically, JIRA integration was verified).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information (plain text passwords) through an API response.
*   **Insecure Handling of Credentials:**  The system is not obfuscating or removing passwords from API output, which is a common security practice.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to the exposed password can potentially gain unauthorized access to the integrated service (e.g., JIRA).
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised service credentials could be used as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems or sensitive resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **API Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by querying the specific API endpoint for service integration details.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to make requests to the GitLab API. This may require authentication.
*   **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker would need to know the correct API endpoint for retrieving service integration information.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The vulnerability was specifically checked with the JIRA integration but may impact other service integrations.
*   The provided fix for the vulnerability was included in version 8.13.11+dfsg1-8+deb9u1.
