Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0926:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly enforce restrictions on disabled OAuth providers. Specifically, even when a specific OAuth provider (like GitHub) is disabled in GitLab's admin settings, it was still possible for users to authenticate via that provider by manipulating the login form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control on the authentication routes. The system failed to check if the OAuth provider was enabled before allowing authentication.
*   **Bypass of Security Settings:** The vulnerability allows a user to bypass the administrator-configured setting that disables a specific OAuth provider, which should prevent logins through that provider.
*   **Form Manipulation:** The attack vector relies on the ability of the user to modify the login form's action attribute to redirect the authentication request to the disabled OAuth providerâ€™s route.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A user could log into GitLab using a disabled OAuth provider if the user is already logged in to the OAuth provider or if the user logs into the OAuth provider as part of the GitLab login process.
*   **Circumvention of Security Policy:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security measures implemented by the system administrator, potentially gaining access to the system in a manner not intended or allowed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Form Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the HTML form on the login page to submit to the OAuth provider's authentication endpoint (`/users/auth/github` in the example) instead of the standard LDAP or local authentication route.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to GitLab Login Page:** The attacker needs to access the GitLab login page.
*   **Basic HTML Manipulation:**  The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the HTML form before submitting it, which can be achieved using browser developer tools.
*   **OAuth Account:** The attacker needs an account with the OAuth provider (e.g., a GitHub account).
*   **Linked GitLab Account:** The attacker needs to have previously linked their GitLab account with the OAuth account for the bypass to work.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information gives a clear and detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The report includes screenshots demonstrating the configuration of disabled OAuth provider logins, the manipulated form, and a successful login through the disabled provider.
*   The user testing this vulnerability was using LDAP authentication as a baseline and then showed the bypass working.
*   The version of GitLab that was tested was 9.1.3-TR
