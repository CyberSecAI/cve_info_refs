Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue within the Filesystem component. Specifically, it appears to be related to how symbolic links are handled in the `/data/bugreports` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability to bypass operating system protections, allowing it to access data outside its permission levels.
- **Symlink Handling:** The core issue seems to be with how symlinks are being used, and this has been addressed by moving the location of the symlinks from `/data/bugreports` to `/bugreports`. This change suggests that the vulnerability was tied to the location of these symlinks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Access:** A successful exploit could allow a malicious application to access sensitive data without proper authorization. This data would normally be protected by the operating system's sandboxing mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector requires a malicious application to be installed on the device. This application would then need to trigger the vulnerability in the Filesystem component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
- **Local Access:** The attacker leverages a local application with the intent to escalate privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix for this issue involves moving the symlinks associated with bug reports from `/data/bugreports` to `/bugreports`. This change is described in commit `ae46511bfa62b56938b3df824bb2ee737dceaa7a` and `0e7324e9095a209d4f06ba00812b2b2976fe2846`

- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" because it's a bypass of user-level defense in depth rather than a full system compromise.

- The vulnerability was reported internally at Google.

In summary, CVE-2017-0426 involves a local information disclosure vulnerability due to the incorrect handling of symlinks within the filesystem. A malicious app could exploit this to access sensitive data it should not normally have access to.
