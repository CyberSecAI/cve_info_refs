ALSA: pcm: prevent UAF in snd\_pcm\_infoWhen the device descriptor is closed, the `substream->runtime` pointer
is freed. But another thread may be in the ioctl handler, case
SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_PCM\_INFO. This case calls snd\_pcm\_info\_user() which
calls snd\_pcm\_info() which accesses the now freed `substream->runtime`.
Note: this fixes CVE-2017-0861

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -

  -
  [4.13.0.38.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1563994#c0)  Adam MariÅ¡    2018-04-05 06:51:32 UTC  ``` Use-after-free vulnerability in the snd_pcm_info() function in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel allows attackers to induce a kernel memory corruption and possibly crash or lock up a system. Due to the nature of the flaw, a privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

                 CVE-2018-1000199

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-9016

    Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue block layer
    (blk-mq).  On a system with a driver using blk-mq (mtip32xx,
    null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user might be able to use this
    for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-0861

    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)
    PCM core.  We believe this was not possible in practice.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

CVE-2017-13166

    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling
    code has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided
    buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing
    destination addresses to be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a
    local user with access to a suitable video device can exploit this
    to overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-13220

    Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation could
    dereference a pointer before performing the necessary type check.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-16526

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference
    an invalid pointer in an error case.  A local user might be able
    to use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16911

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed
    kernel heap addresses to local users.  This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-16912

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to an out-of-bounds read.  A remote user able to connect to the
    USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16913

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to excessive memory allocation.  A remote user able to connect to
    the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16914

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    check for an invalid combination of fields in a received packet,
    leading to a null pointer dereference.  A remote user able to
    connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18017

    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module
    failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free.  If this module is loaded, it could be used by a
    remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code
    execution.

CVE-2017-18203

    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and
    deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices.  A local user could
    potentially use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18232

    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem, between probing and destroying a port.  This
    could lead to a deadlock.  A physically present attacker could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-18241

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-5332

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds
    write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded
    could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-5333

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly
    handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could
    possibly use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-5750

    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap
    address.  This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-6927

    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on futexes did
    not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a
    denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-7492

    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null
    pointer check.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module
    loaded could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-7566

    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-1000004

    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer
    core, between multiple ioctl operations.  This could lead to a
    deadlock or use-after-free.  A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.56-1.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2390)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 16th August 2018]
The original errata text was missing reference to CVE-2018-5390 fix. We have updated the errata text to correct this issue. No changes have been made to the packages.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3693)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* kernel: kvm: vmx: host GDT limit corruption (CVE-2018-10901)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_seq\_ioctl\_create\_port() (CVE-2017-15265)
* kernel: race condition in snd\_seq\_write() may lead to UAF or OOB-access (CVE-2018-7566)
* kernel: Race condition in sound system can lead to denial of service (CVE-2018-1000004)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Intel OSSIRT (Intel.com) for reporting CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646; Vladimir Kiriansky (MIT) and Carl Waldspurger (Carl Waldspurger Consulting) for reporting CVE-2018-3693; Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University, Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390; and Vegard Nossum (Oracle Corporation) for reporting CVE-2018-10901.

Bug Fix(es):

* The Least recently used (LRU) operations are batched by caching pages in per-cpu page vectors to prevent contention of the heavily used lru\_lock spinlock. The page vectors can hold even the compound pages. Previously, the page vectors were cleared only if they were full. Subsequently, the amount of memory held in page vectors, which is not reclaimable, was sometimes too high. Consequently the page reclamation started the Out of Memory (OOM) killing processes. With this update, the underlying source code has been fixed to clear LRU page vectors each time when a compound page is added to them. As a result, OOM killing processes due to high amounts of memory held in page vectors no longer occur. (BZ#1575819)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

èé¾é£ discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1012-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1012.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1012.16)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1022-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem)
  -
  [4.13.0-1022.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem/4.13.0-1022.24)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 444 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2684313.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 30 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.Â  24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2679563.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2679563.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.Â  10 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2664876.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id= 2664876.1).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

To do so, we need to enable the kdump service:  # systemctl enable kdump.service  set the following sysctls (using /etc/sysctl.conf conf file)  kernel.panic_on_rcu_stall=1 kernel.panic=1  then, reboot the system.  when the RCU stall takes place again, kdump should generate a vmcore file in the /var/crash/ directory.  Using the vmcore we can have a better idea of what caused the RCU stall.  -- Daniel   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c4)  Marcelo Tosatti    2018-04-23 17:18:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to Pei Zhang from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c0)) > Created [attachment 1424448](attachment.cgi?id=1424448 "Guest call trace log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1424448&action=edit "Guest call trace log") > Guest call trace log >  > Description of problem: > In rt guest, when running determine_maximum_mpps.sh to get the mpps value, > the script execution fail and also guest Call Trace. >  >  > Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): > qemu-kvm-rhev-2.10.0-21.el7_5.2.x86_64 > tuned-2.9.0-1.el7.noarch > libvirt-3.9.0-14.el7.x86_64 > kernel-rt-3.10.0-871.rt56.814.el7.x86_64 >  >  > How reproducible: > 1/1 >  > Steps to Reproduce: > 1.

The trace is not showing any scheduling events in the CPU1 (i.e., wakeup and switch), but it is showing on CPU0. So, trace is working but no events are happening in the CPU1 - that means that no sched switch is happening, and probably, that the sched wakeup took place a long time ago. As an action, we need to increase the size of the trace buffer.  What I see in the traces are many lines like these:     queuelat-2051    1dNh10   798.909935: local_timer_entry:    vector=239     queuelat-2051    1dNh10   798.909936: local_timer_exit:     vector=239     queuelat-2051    1dNh10   798.909941: reschedule_entry:     vector=253     queuelat-2051    1dNh10   798.909941: reschedule_exit:      vector=253     queuelat-2051    1dNh10   798.909943: local_timer_entry:    vector=239     queuelat-2051    1dNh10   798.909943: local_timer_exit:     vector=239  So, IRQs are enabled, because IRQs are taking place. I see timer and *reschedule* IRQs happening.  The flags (e.g, 1dNh10) shows that N is set. N means that need resched is set - I also see this flag in the thread info of the current task (queuelat). So it is enabled - and for a loooong time (at least 30 seconds).  The need resched flag is used to tell if the system needs to call the scheduler. The scheduler is called as soon as preemptions get enabled, or at the return of an interrupt handler.  As the interrupt handlers are running, and the scheduler is not actually scheduling.  why?  One reason could be the preempting being disabled. But that is not the case because I see preemption enabled in the preempt counter of the curr task.  So, my current guesses are that, we are either not checking need resched in the return of the interrupt handler (preempt enable no resched?), or that we are calling the scheduler but it is not noticing that there is a higher prio task (in a fast read of the rq structure I see that the rtprio structure is pointing to the correct high prio...)  I need to think about how to get more information with trace - but I need to carefully select the tracepoints/functions I want to get because we are seeing the crash some minutes after the events we want to observe takes place - fulfilling the trace buffer.  I will continue working on it tomorrow.  -- Daniel   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c19)  Pei Zhang    2018-04-28 05:25:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1427947](attachment.cgi?id=1427947 "File in /tmp/outdir") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1427947&action=edit "File in /tmp/outdir") File in /tmp/outdir  (In reply to Marcelo Tosatti from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c16)) > (In reply to Pei Zhang from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c14)) > > (In reply to Pei Zhang from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c13)) > > > Created [attachment 1426617](attachment.cgi?id=1426617 "File in /tmp/outdir") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1426617&action=edit "File in /tmp/outdir") > > > File in /tmp/outdir > > >  > > > (In reply to Marcelo Tosatti from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c8)) > > > > Created [attachment 1426103](attachment.cgi?id=1426103 "determine_maximum_mpps.sh with debugging options") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1426103&action=edit "determine_maximum_mpps.sh with debugging options") > > > > determine_maximum_mpps.sh with debugging options > > >  > > > Hi Marcelo, > > >  > > > The file in /tmp/outdir is attached to this comment.

Hi Daniel,  As soon as ktimersoftd/1 is able to run, and execute  run_timer_softirq -> __run_timers -> delayed_work_timer_fn,  tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick will stop getting the timers from  [comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c27) into the:   get_next_timer_interrupt() call  And the interrupt storm will stop.  So one fix would be:   "If TIMER_SOFTIRQ softirq is pending (therefore ktimersoftd execution is pending), do not take old-style timers into account, since the end of execution of __run_timers will rearm timers in the future as necessary."  Unsure if that is the right level to fix the bug  though, i'll prepare a fix and send upstream.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1569910#c30)  Daniel Bristot de Oliveira    2018-06-07 06:32:14 UTC  ``` Hi Marcelo,  Nice!

Debian Bug     : 887106

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-0861

    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)
    PCM core.  We believe this was not possible in practice.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-13166

    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling
    code has been found.  Memory protections ensuring user-provided
    buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing
    destination addresses to be in kernel space.  On a 64-bit kernel
    (amd64 flavour) a local user with access to a suitable video
    device can exploit this to overwrite kernel memory, leading to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16526

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference
    an invalid pointer in an error case.  A local user might be able
    to use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16911

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed
    kernel heap addresses to local users.  This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-16912

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to an out-of-bounds read.  A remote user able to connect to the
    USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16913

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to excessive memory allocation.  A remote user able to connect to
    the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16914

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    check for an invalid combination of fields in a recieved packet,
    leading to a null pointer dereference.  A remote user able to
    connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18017

    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module
    failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free.  If this module is loaded, it could be used by a
    remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code
    execution.

CVE-2017-18203

    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and
    deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices.  A local user could
    potentially use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values.  On a 64-bit
    kernel (amd64 flavour), a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-5332

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds
    write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded
    could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-5333

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly
    handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could
    possibly use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-5750

    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap
    address.  This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-6927

    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on futexes did
    not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a
    denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-7492

    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null
    pointer check.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module
    loaded could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-7566

    èé¾é£ (Fan LongFei) reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-1000004

    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer
    core, between multiple ioctl operations.  This could lead to a
    deadlock or use-after-free.  A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

Additionally, some mitigations for CVE-2017-5753 are included in this
release:

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.101-1.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions
up to and including 3.2.101.  It also fixes a regression in the
procfs hidepid option in the previous version (Debian bug #887106).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Tower driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15102](/security/CVE-2017-15102))

ChunYu Wang discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code, ([CVE-2017-15115](/security/CVE-2017-15115))

It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did

not properly handle NULL payloads with non-zero length values. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-15274](/security/CVE-2017-15274))

It was discovered that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not validate the type of socket

passed in the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(). A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

privilege could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15868](/security/CVE-2017-15868))

Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the USB

serial console driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16525](/security/CVE-2017-16525))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3619-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

5 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3619-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed in

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not

properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-16994](/security/CVE-2017-16994))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

èé¾é£ discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

It was discovered that the Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus controller driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device resources. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-8043](/security/CVE-2018-8043))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1014-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1014.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1014.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1016-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0-1016.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)
* [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0.1016.14](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Before we go on a wild goose chase in XFS, can you first confirm that DM is completing all outstanding IOs correctly (e.g. via blktrace) and that XFS isn't actually waiting on a log IO completion that has got lost?  -Dave.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c4)  Zdenek Kabelac    2018-04-06 07:46:30 UTC  ``` I've already analyzed this case with Carlos - so he will explain more details for XFS part of problem.  DM is in faulty stage - switching to read-only mode - the ext4 handles same case easily.   XFS gets stuck in mentioned function waiting on an action that cannot happen.  So far we have not prepared more 'easier' test since it's nontrivial to hit table switch in the very same moment.  Basic trable is - thin-pool is switch to 'out-of-metadata' read-only mode and when the time is 'right' the action for reporting IO error happens to early (at least that's what I remember from Carlos explanation).  Also - there is already fix made by him - but having better test case that does not rely on faulty thin-pool metadata logic  is still missing (and likely bug in DM target will get fixed soon - so not usable for further testing)  Also feel free to use reproducer from [bug 1563697](show_bug.cgi?id=1563697 "CLOSED ERRATA - Triming on full pool can trigger 'dm_pool_alloc_data_block' failed: error = -28"). The only mandatory condition is - the PV in use must be on very fast device (nearly zero latency -  I'd suggest  ramdisk based loop device - as it's very tricky race condition.)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c5)  Carlos Maiolino    2018-04-06 13:12:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dave Chinner from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c3)) > Waiting in xlog_wait() implies that the log IO has not been completed. i.e. > that whatever error occurred in the DM layer has not been correctly > completed with an error, and XFS is still waiting for it. >  > Before we go on a wild goose chase in XFS, can you first confirm that DM is > completing all outstanding IOs correctly (e.g. via blktrace) and that XFS > isn't actually waiting on a log IO completion that has got lost? >  > -Dave.  Hi Dave,  I'm still not 100% sure this might be a bug in XFS, mainly due the fact it is so far, only reproducible due a bug in device-mapper. There are more data than the stacktrace mentioned above though.  The stacktrace comes from a fstrim process stuck on the log force.  The IO has not been completed, yes, it failed.  The IO error is detected by XFS in xlog_iodone(), during the io completion of the iclog submitted by xfs_log_force, during the fstrim process.  When xfs_log_force_umount() is called, and it runs the xlog callbacks via xlog_state_do_callbacks() to wake up all the threads waiting on iclog->ic_force_wait, it does skip the thread waiting on the fstrim process, well, at least I thought it was skipping it (more about it below).  At this point XFS has been shut down, and the waiting fstrim has never been woken up.  I was tracking down why the fstrim thread was being skipped during the shutdown process, but I figured it out it's not actually skipping. xlog_state_do_callbacks() get stuck while trying to run the iclog's callback.  I'm actually tracking down why it's getting stuck. Hoping to have some updates soon   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c6)  Dave Chinner    2018-04-09 10:42:22 UTC  ``` Hi carlos,  Can you post the notes/details of the analysis to the bz? That way everyone can follow along with the analysis you've done, otherwise we're completely in the dark about what the problem you're seeing is and can't actually help at all short of duplicating everything you're already doing...  Cheers,  Dave.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c7)  Carlos Maiolino    2018-04-09 13:57:26 UTC  ``` Hi Dave,  (In reply to Dave Chinner from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c6)) > Hi carlos, >  > Can you post the notes/details of the analysis to the bz? That way everyone > can follow along with the analysis you've done, otherwise we're completely > in the dark about what the problem you're seeing is and can't actually help > at all short of duplicating everything you're already doing...  Yes, my apologies to have not updated it sooner, I was trying to get more data and have more details about it, but so far, what I tracked is:   - xlog_iodone runs for the xlog where the IO error occurred, and it falls into the shutdown case, calling xfs_do_force_shutdown, which will end up callign xfs_log_force_umount().  In xfs_log_force_umount(), xlog_state_ioerror() is called and all iclogs are properly marked with XLOG_STATE_IOERROR.  Then we fall into xlog_state_do_callback, which is supposed to wake up the processes sleeping in iclog->ic_force_wait of each iclog.  Most of the iclogs clean up are done properly, but every time, the last iclog on the list get stuck.  Its callback (xlog_cil_committed) is called from xlog_state_do_callback in:  cb->cb_func(cb->cb_arg, aborted), which never returns back to xlog_state_do_callback(), so, it can't wake up the threads sleeping in ic_force_wait.  xlog_cil_committed calls into xfs_trans_committed_bulk(), which will then unpin all the log items.  in the if (aborted) conditional, it calls into the iop_unpin() operation of the log items.  The last cil item which had been marked with XLOG_STATE_IOERROR above, will call its associated log item iop_unpin, which is xfs_buf_item_unpin() and get stuck there.   Into xfs_buf_item_unpin, we try to lock the buffer into:  } else if (freed && remove) {         xfs_buf_lock() . . }  And it stops trying to acquire the buffer's semaphore into xfs_buf_lock()  down(&bp->b_sema);   That's basically where I am now.  The buffer semaphore is held somewhere else (where I still don't know), preventing the force umount to continue and wake up the fstrim threas sleeping on the ic_force_wait.   I'll update once I have more information.  Cheers   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c8)  Dave Chinner    2018-04-09 22:41:45 UTC  ``` Carlos,  If we are hanging in xfs_buf_item_unpin() trying to lock a buffer, that implies we are holding the buffer locked while calling xfs_log_force(XFS_LOG_SYNC). XFS_LOG_SYNC should not be used whenever we hold metadata locked....  IOWs, I suspect the bug is in xfs_trim_extents(), where it reads and locks the AGF then does a synchronous log force. Moving the sync log force to before locking the AGF should avoid the hang.....  Cheers,  Dave.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c9)  Murphy Zhou    2018-04-26 00:51:01 UTC  ``` we need acks here.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c12)  Bruno Meneguele    2018-05-02 13:10:02 UTC  ``` Patch(es) available on kernel-3.10.0-879.el7   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1564186#c15)  Zorro Lang    2018-08-17 13:43:03 UTC  ``` Use scsi_debug to test this bug: # modprobe scsi_debug dev_size_mb=2048 lbpu=1 lbpws=1    1) Reproduced this bug on kernel 878.el7, which has both [bug 1563697](show_bug.cgi?id=1563697 "CLOSED ERRATA - Triming on full pool can trigger 'dm_pool_alloc_data_block' failed: error = -28") and this bug: # ./check generic/500 FSTYP         -- xfs (non-debug) PLATFORM      -- Linux/x86_64 ibm-x3550m3-05 3.10.0-878.el7.x86_64 MKFS_OPTIONS  -- -f -bsize=4096 /dev/sde MOUNT_OPTIONS -- -o context=system_u:object_r:root_t:s0 /dev/sde /mnt/scratch  generic/500  ^C^C    2) Tested on kernel 920.el7 which hasn't fixed [bug 1563697](show_bug.cgi?id=1563697 "CLOSED ERRATA - Triming on full pool can trigger 'dm_pool_alloc_data_block' failed: error = -28"), but fixed this bug:  # ./check generic/500 FSTYP         -- xfs (non-debug) PLATFORM      -- Linux/x86_64 ibm-x3550m3-05 3.10.0-920.el7.x86_64.debug MKFS_OPTIONS  -- -f -bsize=4096 /dev/sde MOUNT_OPTIONS -- -o context=system_u:object_r:root_t:s0 /dev/sde /mnt/scratch  generic/500     [failed, exit status 1]- output mismatch (see /root/git/xfstests-dev/results//generic/500.out.bad)     --- tests/generic/500.out   2018-07-25 00:00:54.313201624 -0400     +++ /root/git/xfstests-dev/results//generic/500.out.bad     2018-08-17 09:09:44.766198368 -0400     @@ -1,2 +1,26 @@      QA output created by 500     -Silence is golden     +fstrim: /mnt/scratch: FITRIM ioctl failed: Input/output error     +fstrim: cannot open /mnt/scratch: Input/output error     +fstrim: cannot open /mnt/scratch: Input/output error     +fstrim: cannot open /mnt/scratch: Input/output error     +fstrim: cannot open /mnt/scratch: Input/output error     ...

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them â but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

The use after-free condition may result in privilege escalation.   Investigation is ongoing.  Upstream Patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=401e7e88d4ef80188ffa07095ac00456f901b8c4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1709180#c1)  Marian Rehak    2019-05-13 07:10:02 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1709181](show_bug.cgi?id=1709181 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-11811 kernel: use-after-free in drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c, ipmi_si_mem_io.c, ipmi_si_port_io.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1709180#c2)  Justin M. Forbes    2019-05-13 12:55:31 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 5.0.4 stable kernel updates.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1709180#c10)  Eric Christensen    2019-05-30 15:04:53 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw has been rated as "Moderate" as the attacker needs to be able to abuse this flaw in a very narrow race condition of the kernel module being unloaded. This scoring system from this flaw differentiates from other sources as the attacker must have a local account to be able to read the file (/proc/ioports) while the module is unloaded. None of the above actions are 'network facing' attack vectors.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1709180#c11)  Eric Christensen    2019-05-30 15:04:56 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  A mitigation to this flaw would be to no longer use IPMI on affected hardware until the kernel has been updated. Existing systems that have IPMI kernel modules loaded will need to unload the "ipmi_si" kernel module and blacklist ( See <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278> for a guide on how to blacklist modules). Take careful consideration that if unloading and blacklisting the module, this creates a one-time attack vector window for a local attacker.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1709180#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-29 15:14:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:1873 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1873](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1873)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1709180#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-29 15:15:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:1891 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1891](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1891)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1709180#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-29 19:18:35 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 297 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2494878.1).

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://www.java.com/en/](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 5 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.Â  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3083)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1601849#c0)  Vladis Dronov    2018-07-17 10:41:22 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Linux kernel in the KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. This can lead to a privilege escalation.  An upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3444d7da1839b851eefedd372978d8a982316c36>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1601849#c10)  Vladis Dronov    2018-07-26 13:02:30 UTC  ``` Notes:  Only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is vulnerable to a possible privilege escalation due to this flaw.

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)
* kernel: Inifinite loop vulnerability in madvise\_willneed() function allows local denial of service (CVE-2017-18208)
* kernel: fuse-backed file mmap-ed onto process cmdline arguments causes denial of service (CVE-2018-1120)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo\_release serialization allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-5344)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in \_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)
* kernel: buffer overflow in drivers/net/wireless/ath/wil6210/wmi.c:wmi\_set\_ie() may lead to memory corruption (CVE-2018-5848)
* kernel: out-of-bound write in ext4\_init\_block\_bitmap function with a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10878)
* kernel: Improper validation in bnx2x network card driver can allow for denial of service attacks via crafted packet (CVE-2018-1000026)
* kernel: Information leak when handling NM entries containing NUL (CVE-2016-4913)
* kernel: Mishandling mutex within libsas allowing local Denial of Service (CVE-2017-18232)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_process\_freed\_data() when mounting crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1092)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_xattr\_inode\_hash() causes crash with crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1094)
* kernel: vhost: Information disclosure in vhost.c:vhost\_new\_msg() (CVE-2018-1118)
* kernel: Denial of service in resv\_map\_release function in mm/hugetlb.c (CVE-2018-7740)
* kernel: Memory leak in the sas\_smp\_get\_phy\_events function in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c (CVE-2018-7757)
* kernel: Invalid pointer dereference in xfs\_ilock\_attr\_map\_shared() when mounting crafted xfs image allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-10322)
* kernel: use-after-free detected in ext4\_xattr\_set\_entry with a crafted file (CVE-2018-10879)
* kernel: out-of-bound access in ext4\_get\_group\_info() when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10881)
* kernel: stack-out-of-bounds write in jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata function (CVE-2018-10883)
* kernel: incorrect memory bounds check in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c (CVE-2018-10940)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
