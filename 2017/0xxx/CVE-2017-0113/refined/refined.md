  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple heap out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library during font processing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds reads",
       "Wild reads"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to crashes triggered by invalid memory access.",
    "attack_vectors": "Processing a malformed font file or calling Uniscribe API functions against such fonts.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malformed font file to be processed by the vulnerable system or call a vulnerable API function with malformed font data."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerabilities were discovered through fuzzing, and a large number of crashes were observed in various functions of the Uniscribe library (USP10.dll), including functions within the OpenType Layout (OTL) processing. The crashes involved invalid memory read accesses at different memory locations, with some occurring at page boundaries. The sheer number of crashes made root cause analysis for each one difficult. The provided list of crash locations indicates the vulnerable functions where the invalid memory reads occur. The issue is reproducible on Windows 7, and PageHeap should be enabled for more reliable reproduction. A custom program is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
