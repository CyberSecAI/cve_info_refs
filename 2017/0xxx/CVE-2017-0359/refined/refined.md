    "CVE-2017-0359": {
      "root_cause": "The diffoscope tool, prior to version 77, was vulnerable to writing to arbitrary locations on disk due to the way it handled filenames when extracting files from untrusted archives.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate sanitization of filenames from untrusted archives",
        "Use of provided filename for file extraction path construction."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially overwrite or create files in arbitrary locations on the file system where the vulnerable tool was being executed.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious archive with specific filenames, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to write to arbitrary locations on disk.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted archive file to be processed by the vulnerable version of `diffoscope`."
