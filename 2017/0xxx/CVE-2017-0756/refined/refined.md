{
  "CVE-2017-0756": {
    "Description": "The most severe vulnerability in this section could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "Root cause": "Configuration error where a buffer was initially sized based on configuration at that time and held onto throughout its lifetime. If the configuration changed later, the code didn't handle this, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper buffer sizing",
      "Inadequate handling of configuration changes"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution in a privileged process.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted media file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send a specially crafted file to the targeted device.",
    "Additional details": "The fix involves storing the 'current allocation size' and checking for changes in the buffer size. If it has changed, it discards the old buffer and allocates a new one of the appropriate size. Logging has also been added to track how often this occurs. This was tested and verified on a device where proof of concept (POC) was built."
