Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0685:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `soft_avc` encoder within the Android media framework. Specifically, the cached buffer sizes were not being properly handled at certain 'reset' points. This allowed a malicious application to manipulate buffer sizes such that crafted requests would cause the encoder to read or write outside of its allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. By manipulating the cached buffer sizes, an attacker could cause the encoder to write data outside of the current buffer, leading to memory corruption.
- **Improper buffer management:** The root cause is an issue with how the encoder manages cached buffer sizes, allowing for manipulation at reset points and resulting in the out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of service (DoS):** The provided information in the Android Security Bulletin indicates this vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service condition which has a High severity.  An out-of-bounds write in a media processing context can cause a crash of the media service, preventing media playback functionality.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Crafted media file:** The attack vector involves an attacker providing a specially crafted media file that triggers the buffer size manipulation flaw in the `soft_avc` encoder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to provide media data:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a media file to the affected device, meaning they could be a local application or a remote attacker sending data.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The commit message from android.googlesource.com explains the fix as forcing a buffer reallocation with new sizes whenever the encoder state reaches such 'reset' points.
- The commit message from android.googlesource.com also mentions a bug where the number of bytes consumed in multi-threaded execution was 0 causing a decoder to run in an infinite loop.
- The Android Security Bulletin confirms the DoS impact of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in `libmpeg2`.
- The Android Security Bulletin indicates that a specifically crafted media file is used for exploitation.
