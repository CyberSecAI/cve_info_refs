Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-0085

**Root Cause:**
An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `usp10!otlChainRuleSetTable::rule` function within the Windows Uniscribe library. This is triggered by a crafted TrueType Font (TTF) file. A single byte change within the "GSUB" table of the font file leads to an overly large 16-bit integer being calculated, which is used as an index for an array, leading to the out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is that the program attempts to read data from memory locations outside the allocated buffer for a font file. Specifically the crafted TTF font file manipulates the `otlChainRuleTable::backtrackGlyphCount()` function to return an overly large integer, which is then used in a loop without proper validation in `otlChainingLookup::apply()`. This leads to an out-of-bounds memory read when accessing data via an array of 16 bit indexes within `otlChainRuleSetTable::rule`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the integer returned by `otlChainRuleTable::backtrackGlyphCount()` before using it as an index in subsequent loops.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact, as observed in the provided crash information, is a crash due to an access violation. This could lead to a denial of service.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to disclose sensitive information from the process heap by reading data beyond allocated memory bounds, this is explicitly mentioned by the original researcher as a possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Font File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted TTF font file to the vulnerable Windows system. This can be achieved by:
   - Embedding the font file in a document or web page.
   - Having a user open a document or website that uses the malicious font.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted TTF font file to the target system. This could be done through:
    - Email attachments.
    - Malicious websites.
    - Malicious documents.
    - Any application that parses TTF font files.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges, as the vulnerability exists in user-mode code.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Google Security Research and reported under the project-zero ID 1019.
- The vulnerability is present in Windows Uniscribe user-mode library (usp10.dll).
- The provided exploit details that modifying offset `0x845A` from `0x00` to `0xFF` in a font file's "GSUB" table will trigger the vulnerability
- The vulnerability is reproducible on Windows 7.
- It may be easier to reproduce with PageHeap enabled, but it can also occur in a default system configuration.
