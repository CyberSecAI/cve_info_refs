{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Audioserver due to incorrect calculation of the array size when querying speaker angles.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect array size calculation",
      "Potential for memory corruption/out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application could execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to install and run a malicious application on the device"
     ],
    "additional_information": "The code assumed that the size of the array for speaker angle data was at least 3x2, where 2 is the number of virtual speakers. However, the array size should be max(2, nbChannels). When a mono channel mask was used, the code would crash. This issue could potentially be used to gain local access to elevated capabilities."
