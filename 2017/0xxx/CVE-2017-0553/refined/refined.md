Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-0553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An integer overflow vulnerability exists within the `nlmsg_reserve()` function of the `libnl` library. This function is responsible for allocating memory for netlink messages. The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted `@len` argument is passed to `nlmsg_reserve()`, causing an integer overflow during buffer size calculation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation within the `nlmsg_reserve()` function, allowing a large `len` argument to cause an integer overflow during buffer calculation. The vulnerability is in this calculation: `tlen = pad ? ((len + (pad - 1)) & ~(pad - 1)) : len;`
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Due to the integer overflow, the function reserves too small a memory region. When data is copied into this insufficient buffer, it results in a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  Libnl functions assume that arguments are valid and do not sanitize them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running an application that uses the affected `libnl` library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker providing crafted arguments to `libnl` functions through an application compiled against the library.
*   **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerability can be triggered remotely in a scenario where the libnl library is processing untrusted input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access (for local exploitation):** The attacker must have local access to the system to execute an application compiled using the vulnerable library.
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input value to the `len` parameter. This can be achieved locally by controlling arguments to functions that call `nlmsg_reserve` or remotely by injecting crafted data into a network stream that's being processed by an application linked with the vulnerable library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the libnl library, specifically in how it handles user-supplied length arguments when reserving memory for netlink messages.
*   The fix is to check for integer overflows in `nlmsg_reserve()`
*  The vulnerability exists in both `libnl` and `libnl3` which required a separate fix for each.

**Summary of Affected Software based on the extracted documents:**

*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Fedora 24 and 25
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu 12.04 ESM, 14.04 ESM, 16.04 ESM, 16.10, and 17.04
*   **Android:** Android is also affected and requires a fix
*   **Other:** The library is widely used, and any system using the affected versions of the library is vulnerable.
