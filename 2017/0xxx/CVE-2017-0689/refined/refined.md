Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0689:

**CVE-2017-0689**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `libhevc` library, specifically during the parsing of slice headers in the video decoding process. An insufficient check for buffer overflows during the parsing of long-term reference indices leads to an exploitable condition.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow. The code fails to validate the size of data being written into a buffer, specifically the long-term reference buffer, which can be overflowed by crafted input.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability arises from the absence of proper checks on the parsed data to ensure it doesn't exceed allocated buffer sizes.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. By crafting a malicious file that triggers the overflow, an attacker can cause the media process to crash or become unresponsive, impacting the availability of media playback and related functions.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by providing a specially crafted media file (HEVC format) to a device which uses `libhevc`.
    *   **Malicious Media File:** The crafted HEVC file would contain malformed data in the slice header, specifically related to long-term reference indices, designed to trigger the buffer overflow.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Ability to deliver a malicious HEVC file:** The attacker must be capable of sending a malicious HEVC file to a vulnerable device. This could be through web pages, email, messaging applications, or other methods that trigger media playback.
    *   **No special privileges:**  No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is only needed to open the malicious file.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix, as mentioned in the commit message (2210ff5600d3f965352a3074adff8fedddcf347e), addresses the buffer overflow issue in the parsing of slice headers and long-term reference indices specifically in the `libhevc` library.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Denial of Service (DoS) with a high severity rating.
*   Affected versions include Android 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1 and 7.1.2.
*   The fix increments the number of long-term reference buffers only when both the top and bottom fields have been set as long-term.
*  The fix also checks for buffer overflows in pps/slice header parsing.

This vulnerability is part of the Android Security Bulletin of July 2017, indicating it was considered a significant issue requiring patching.
