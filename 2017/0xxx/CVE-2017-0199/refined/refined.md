Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-0199:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Office applications (specifically Word and Excel) handle OLE objects with external links and HTA files. The core issue is that these applications process the `application/hta` content-type for linked OLE objects by using a COM object which then invokes the Microsoft HTA engine (`mshta.exe`) to handle this content. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by serving a specially crafted HTA file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted OLE object linking:**  Office applications permit OLE objects to be linked to external resources, including those on attacker-controlled servers.
- **Lack of Content-Type validation:** When an OLE object links to a remote file, the application uses the content-type of the remote file instead of validating against a list of allowed content-types.
- **Automatic execution of HTA:** By specifying  `application/hta` as the content type for a linked resource, the application uses mshta.exe to parse and execute the content of the linked file, which could contain malicious code.
- **Object update:** The vulnerability can be further exploited by using the `\objupdate` control in the RTF, causing automatic execution of the linked resource when the document is opened, bypassing the need for user interaction.
- **Bypass of mitigations:** The vulnerability bypassed most mitigations prior to the availability of a patch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This could enable attackers to:
- Install malware
- Steal data
- Establish remote control
- Carry out various malicious activities on the compromised system

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Office Documents:** Attackers embed OLE objects with links to malicious HTA files within specially crafted Office documents (RTF, DOC, DOCX, PPSX).
- **Email Phishing:** These documents are typically distributed through email phishing campaigns.
- **HTTP Requests:** The exploitation occurs when the application makes a HTTP request to the attacker-controlled server to retrieve the linked resource (the malicious HTA).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Controlled Web Server:** The attacker must have a web server to host the malicious HTA file and serve the `application/hta` content-type.
- **Document Creation:**  Ability to craft malicious Office documents with embedded OLE objects that link to the attacker's server.
- **(Optional) Social Engineering:** While not required for an automatically triggered exploit, it can be used to trick users to interact with the document to run the linked payload.
