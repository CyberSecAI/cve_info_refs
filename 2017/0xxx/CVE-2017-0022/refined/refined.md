{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the `XMLParser::LoadDTD` function of Microsoft XML Core Services. It arises because the function attempts to parse binary file resource URLs as DTD files. When a resource, such as version info, is found, the function incorrectly tries to parse it as a DTD, which leads to a failure and return code `0x80070485`. If the resource does not exist, the function returns `0x80004005`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation in `XMLParser::LoadDTD`. The function doesn't verify if the provided URL points to an actual DTD file before attempting to parse it. This allows an attacker to provide URLs to arbitrary files, exploiting the difference in error codes to detect the presence of files on the system.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a malicious web site to determine the presence of specific executable modules or applications on a user's system. This information can be used by attackers to fingerprint the victim's machine, tailoring further attacks based on the installed software. This vulnerability was used in the wild by exploit kits such as Astrum and Neutrino.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a malicious web page loaded in Internet Explorer. The page makes the vulnerable `XMLParser::LoadDTD` call with file resource URLs to probe for specific files on the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a trusted site. The user must visit this site with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer."
