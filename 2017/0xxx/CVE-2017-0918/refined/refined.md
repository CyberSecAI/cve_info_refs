Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0918:

**CVE-2017-0918**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient restriction of CI (Continuous Integration) runner for project cache access.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on the CI runner, allowing it to access project cache data it shouldn't have access to. This likely involves inadequate permission controls or access policies.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the project cache. The specific impact would depend on what type of data is cached and its value to an attacker.
*   **Attack vectors:** This involves a compromised CI runner, which is likely part of the GitLab infrastructure. 
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely need to be able to influence or control the CI runner or have some level of access to the CI runner environment. This could be achieved by a malicious user or a compromised CI worker.
