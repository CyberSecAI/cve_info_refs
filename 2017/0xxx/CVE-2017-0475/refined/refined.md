Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing boundary check in the recovery verifier when processing the signature of a zip archive. Specifically, the `signature_start` variable, which marks the beginning of the signature from the end of the zip archive, wasn't validated to ensure it falls within the End of Central Directory (EOCD) comment field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Boundary Check:** The core issue is the absence of a check to verify that the calculated `signature_start` location is within the bounds of the EOCD comment field. This allows a malicious zip file to manipulate this value, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access when verifying the signature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Kernel Context:** A successful exploit could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This provides the attacker with the highest level of privilege and control over the device.
*   **Permanent Device Compromise:** The vulnerability is rated as Critical because it could lead to a permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the device's operating system to recover from the attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device would be the primary attack vector. This app would craft a specific zip archive with an out-of-bounds `signature_start` value.
*   **Sideloading:** The vulnerability is exploited when sideloading a maliciously crafted package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the target device.
*   **Malicious Zip Creation:** The attacker needs the skill to create a specially crafted zip archive.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by adding a check to ensure the `signature_start` is within the bounds of the EOCD comment.
*   The fix was released in the Android security patch for March 2017.

**In summary,** CVE-2017-0475 describes a critical vulnerability in the Android recovery verifier due to a missing boundary check during signature verification. This can be exploited by a local malicious application, leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel, potentially bricking the device.
