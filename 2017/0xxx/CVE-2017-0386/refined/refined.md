```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data length checks in the `libnl` library's `nla_reserve` and `nla_put` functions when processing network link attributes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper input validation",
     "Integer overflow",
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local malicious application could execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application that exploits the vulnerability by providing a negative value to `nla_reserve` or `nla_put`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to execute code locally on the affected device."
