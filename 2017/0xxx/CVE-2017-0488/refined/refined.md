{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An issue in the `i264d_deblock_display` function where it could be called without a valid picture buffer. Additionally, initialization of `ps_cur_slice->u1_mbaff_frame_flag` was not handled correctly for error cases.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of decoder state before calling `i264d_deblock_display`.",
      "Incorrect initialization of a flag during error handling, potentially leading to unexpected behavior."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to the potential crash or unexpected behavior in the Mediaserver process when processing specially crafted media content.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted video file that causes the decoder to call `i264d_deblock_display` at the wrong time.",
       "A media file that triggers an error causing incorrect initialization"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted video file that can be processed by the vulnerable Mediaserver component. This can be achieved through various means like MMS, web browsing, email, or any app that processes media content."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2017-0488"
