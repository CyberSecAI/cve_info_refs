Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0736:

**CVE-2017-0736**

*   **Root Cause:** A resolution change within a decode call due to multiple Sequence Parameter Sets (SPS) can cause a hang in the decoder. The decoder would hang because the application would give the same data again in the next decode call.
*   **Vulnerability:**
    *   The decoder doesn't properly handle resolution changes during a decode call when multiple SPS are present.
    * Incorrect SPS parameters were used to detect changes in resolution/SPS.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The decoder hangs, rendering the media functionality unusable.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted media file that contains multiple SPS and triggers a resolution change during decoding.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to provide a media file with the above mentioned characteristics to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided commit messages indicate a fix by flagging an error when SPS/resolution changes occur within a process call and also by using the correct current SPS from decoder context to detect change in resolution/SPS.
* The vulnerability is present in `libavc`, which is used for video decoding.
* The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1 and 7.1.2.
