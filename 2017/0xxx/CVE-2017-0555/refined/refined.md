Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0555:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Mediaserver component, specifically within the `libavc` library. The issue arises from an incorrect initialization of `first_slice_in_pic`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- An information disclosure vulnerability exists due to improper initialization logic in the `libavc` library during media processing. The variable `first_slice_in_pic` could be set to 2, instead of 1, leading to potential data exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local malicious application could potentially exploit this vulnerability to access data outside its intended permission levels.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local application could exploit this flaw to read data it should not be able to access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided source code commit details that the fix ensures that `first_slice_in_pic` is only set to 1 once per picture, even if there are errors during processing of picture data. This prevents information leakage due to improper initialization of this variable in the libavc library.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity because it allows for information disclosure but does not allow for remote code execution or system compromise.
- This vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1.
