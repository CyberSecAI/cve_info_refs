  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2017-0822",
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the system handles camera access via gestures on the lockscreen when the camera has been disabled by an administrator.",
      "Weaknesses": "Improper enforcement of camera access policies on the lockscreen, specifically with gesture-based camera launch.",
       "Impact": "Elevation of privilege. A user could potentially bypass restrictions set by an administrator and access the camera even when it is supposed to be disabled.",
      "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the device, initiating a camera gesture from the lockscreen when the camera is disabled by policy.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to have physical access to the device and knowledge of the camera gesture."
