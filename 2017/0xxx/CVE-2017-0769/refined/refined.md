    "root_cause": "Improper handling of reserved effect commands in the audio effects service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Applications can send reserved effect commands to the audio service.",
      "Lack of input validation/authorization for effect commands on the server side."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege. An attacker can gain elevated permissions by exploiting the audio effect service vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious application sending reserved audio effect commands to the service."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "A malicious application installed on the device."
