Subject: phamm: CVE-2017-0378: reflected XSS in login page

Hi

John Lightsey found a reflected XSS vulnerability in phamm login page.
phamm is a PHP front-end to manage virtual services on LDAP.

Quoting his report in Debian[0]:

> While looking through codesearch.debian.net I noticed that phamm's
> views/helpers.php uses $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] in a way that is
> vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.
>
> To reproduce the problem, load a URL like this in Firefox:
>
> <http://127.0.0.1/phamm/main.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28123%29%3C/script%3E>

Refrences:

 [1] <https://github.com/lota/phamm/issues/21>

Regards,
Salvatore

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
