Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0755:

**CVE-2017-0755**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from how the `addRange` function in the `minikin` library handles cmap (character map) entries. The function assumes that the input ranges are already sorted in ascending order. However, bad fonts can pass arbitrary ranges which may not be sorted, leading to incorrect handling.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The `addRange` function lacks proper validation of the input ranges. Specifically, it doesn't check if the ranges are sorted in ascending order as required by the OpenType specification.
    *   **Unsorted Input Handling:** The function's assumption about sorted input ranges, coupled with the lack of validation, leads to incorrect handling when presented with unsorted or arbitrary ranges.
    
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):**  The vulnerability allows for a potential elevation of privilege. The provided text doesn't elaborate on how this elevation occurs but it's clear that this vulnerability could lead to a malicious app gaining additional permissions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Fonts:** An attacker could craft a malicious font file with unsorted or arbitrary cmap ranges.
    *   **Font Processing:** When the system processes this crafted font through the `minikin` library, the vulnerable `addRange` function gets triggered, leading to potential privilege escalation.
    
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Malicious Application:** The attacker would need to be able to deliver a malicious font file to the system. This can be done by a malicious application running on the device.

**Additional Information:**

The provided text also mentions that the fix involves the `addRange` function now rejecting invalid input and stopping the processing of such "bad fonts." New interfaces `sqllite3_result_pointer()` and `sqllite3_value_pointer()` have been added to handle FTS3 column pointers.

The commit message provides the following:

*   **Bug:** 63852675
*   **Test:** presubmit
*   **Change-Id:** I0f0be2bf21aef8917da63d76d1007fbf8c8ad4d

This information gives context that the vulnerability is related to font processing within the Android operating system and highlights the security implications associated with font files.

The description from the Android Security Bulletin September 2017 also corroborates the above findings:

"The most severe vulnerability in this section could enable a local malicious application to bypass user interaction requirements in order to gain access to additional permissions."
