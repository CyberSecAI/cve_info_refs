{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An invalid chroma to size handling in libhevc could lead to out-of-bounds reads/writes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read/write"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing of specially crafted media files."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send specially crafted media file to device via email, web browsing, MMS or other means.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to an error when parsing, specifically during the handling of chroma to size conversion, leading to a function call with an invalid index. This could cause an out-of-bounds read, write, or another form of memory corruption, leading to arbitrary code execution. The fix limits the `func_idx` to a valid range."
