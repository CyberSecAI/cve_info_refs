Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the media framework, specifically related to how it handles picture units (PUs) sizes during error conditions. When errors occur while processing media, some PUs might be marked as "skip". The issue is that these skipped PUs aren't correctly handled, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper bounds checking:** The code doesn't ensure that skipped PUs remain within the valid picture boundaries after being marked as skipped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted media file can trigger the vulnerability leading to a crash or hang of the media framework due to an out-of-bounds read, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media File:** The primary attack vector involves a remote attacker providing a specially crafted media file. This file, when processed, will trigger the vulnerability in the media framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker needs to deliver a malicious media file to the target device. This can be achieved through various means such as malicious websites, MMS messages, or file sharing applications. The attacker does not need to be local.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided git commit logs detail the fix implemented, which limits boundary PU sizes to prevent the out-of-bounds read in case of errors. The fix includes ensuring such PUs stay within the picture bounds.
- The commit message associated with the fix states, "Limit boundary PU sizes in case of errors. In case of error clips, some PUs are marked as skip. Ensure such PUs stay within the picture."
- The vulnerability is classified as a High severity DoS and affects a range of Android versions, from 4.4.4 to 7.1.2.
