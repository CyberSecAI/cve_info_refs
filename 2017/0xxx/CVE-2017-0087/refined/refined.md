{
  "CVE-2017-0087": {
    "Root cause": "Heap memory corruption in USP10!MergeLigRecords due to a malformed font file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap memory corruption vulnerability in the Uniscribe font processing library.",
      "Improper handling of a crafted font file during text display."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to a crash when displaying text with a corrupted font file.",
    "Attack vectors": "By displaying text using a crafted font file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a malformed font file and cause it to be used by the Uniscribe library. This could be achieved through a website, document, or other application that loads and renders text.",
     "Additional details": "The vulnerability is triggered within the `memcpy` function call within `USP10!MergeLigRecords`. The crash occurs due to an access violation, indicating an attempt to write to an invalid memory location during a memory copy operation. The provided exploit triggers the issue by creating a specially crafted font file, which leads to the memory corruption during the processing of ligatures."
