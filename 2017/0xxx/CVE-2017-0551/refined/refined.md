Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the Mediaserver handles certain bitstream errors, specifically related to the MB (Macroblock) boundary in MBAFF (Macroblock Adaptive Frame Field) streams. When decoding MBAFF streams, slices should terminate on an even MB boundary. If the bytes are exhausted with an odd number of MBs decoded for MBAFF, it should be treated as an error. The root cause is an incorrect handling of this specific error condition in the libavc library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Error Handling:** The code does not correctly handle cases where bytes are exhausted with an odd number of MBs decoded for MBAFF streams.
-   **Denial of Service:** The incorrect error handling leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting the improper error handling when processing specially crafted media files, leading to a device hang or reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Specially crafted media files:** An attacker can use a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability during media file and data processing.
-   **Remote exploitation:** This can be done remotely through various vectors such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing the malicious media files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted media file to the target device, which can be achieved through various remote vectors or local access.
-   No specific position is required as it can be achieved remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content indicates this vulnerability was present in AOSP versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1. The fix addresses an error when decoding MBAFF streams where a slice may not terminate on an even MB boundary and results in improper parsing, which in turn can lead to a denial of service.
