Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0556:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content includes a commit message from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with the bug ID 34093952.
   - The Android Security Bulletin for April 2017 lists CVE-2017-0556 with the same bug ID: "A-34093952".
   - The description of the CVE in the bulletin states: "An information disclosure vulnerability in Mediaserver could enable a local malicious application to access data outside of its permission levels".
   - The commit message indicates a fix in `libmpeg2` related to a check of a "Valid Frame Rate in Header".
   - Based on this, the provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2017-0556, and provides more detail than the basic description in the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   *   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper check of the frame rate within the header of MPEG2 video files processed by `libmpeg2` in the Android Mediaserver. The vulnerability occurs when the frame rate is not validated, and can lead to memory access outside of the application's permissions.

   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the potential to leak information, allowing a malicious application to access data it shouldn't have access to.
        *   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The lack of proper validation on frame rate field in the MPEG2 header is the root cause of the vulnerability.

   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        *   A local malicious application could potentially gain access to sensitive information normally protected by Android's permission system.

   *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   The primary attack vector involves a local malicious application feeding a crafted MPEG2 video file to the Mediaserver process.
        *   The vulnerability would be triggered during the processing of the crafted file, when the insufficient validation of the frame rate allows for information disclosure.

   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   The attacker needs to have an application installed on the Android device with the ability to feed data to the mediaserver process (e.g. via a media intent).
        *   The attacker's app would have to be able to create a specially crafted MPEG2 file with a malformed frame rate in the header.
        *   Exploitation of this vulnerability is a local privilege escalation.

**3. Technical Details**
   * The commit message from android.googlesource.com indicates the fix was implemented as a "Check for Valid Frame Rate in Header". This suggests that before the fix, the code was not properly checking the frame rate.
   * The code change was intended to prevent the out-of-bounds memory access, and it is specific to `libmpeg2`.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-0556 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the `libmpeg2` library used by Android's Mediaserver. It arises from a lack of validation of the frame rate field within the MPEG2 header, potentially leading to unauthorized data access by a local malicious application. The fix involves implementing a check to validate frame rate values, which prevents the information disclosure. This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity because of the limited impact compared to a remote code execution, but it does provide a way for a malicious application to potentially gain access to data outside of its permissions.
