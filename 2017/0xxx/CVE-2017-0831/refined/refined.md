Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0831:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how the system handles app overlay permissions. Specifically, it relates to a flag used in app ops that isn't consistently applied, leading to a bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent permission enforcement for app overlays.
- A flag intended to restrict overlay behavior is not properly utilized everywhere it should be.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious application could potentially bypass user interaction requirements to gain access to additional permissions.
- Specifically, a malicious app could use a system overlay to appear on top of other apps, potentially tricking users into granting elevated privileges.
- The toast and system overlays should not be allowed without permissions.
- This vulnerability is classified as "Elevation of Privilege".

**Attack vectors:**
- A local malicious application exploiting the inconsistent app overlay permission handling

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the device.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided commit messages mention "Replacing app ops fix with the flag that is used elsewhere" which suggests a fix where the inconsistent flag usage is unified and correctly applied.
- The test verification mentions "Verified that toast and system overlay still goes away on permission and a11y service capability screens" which implies that the vulnerability allowed these overlays to persist incorrectly on permission and a11y service screens and the fix makes them go away.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Android 8.0.
