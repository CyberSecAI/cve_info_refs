Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `File.getCanonicalPath()` method in `libcore` handles caching of file paths. The cache mechanism could potentially return stale data if the underlying files are modified by another process or code unaware of the canonical path cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The stale cache could lead to the disclosure of incorrect file paths, possibly exposing sensitive information by pointing to the wrong locations.
- **Inconsistent File Handling**: The canonical path cache might return inaccurate path information after modifications, creating inconsistencies between the actual file system and the application's perception of the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit the inconsistent path resolution to:
- Access or modify files they shouldn't have access to.
- Bypass security checks relying on canonical path comparison.
- Cause unexpected behavior or errors in applications utilizing this method.
- Create symlinks to potentially access arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could manipulate the file system outside of the application's scope (through a different process or user) to modify a file and then trigger the application to access that file, leading to an outdated cached canonical path.
- By manipulating the file system and creating symlinks, an attacker could try to trick the application using stale cached canonical path to point to a malicious file or location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to modify the file system, either directly or indirectly through another process.
- The attacker needs to trigger an application that relies on `File.getCanonicalPath()` method for path resolution.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the applicationâ€™s file access patterns and the existence of the vulnerable cache mechanism.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves disabling the `File.getCanonicalPath()` caching mechanism.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2 and 8.0.
