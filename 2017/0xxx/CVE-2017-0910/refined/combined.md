# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Zulip 1.7.1 security (+ Korean!) release

  [![](/_astro/greg-price.BEialEM6_Z1bVkjS.webp)](author/greg-price/)  [Greg Price](author/greg-price/)   Nov 23, 2017 • 2 min read

Today we’re releasing Zulip Server 1.7.1. This is a security release, containing
just a handful of cherry-picked changes since 1.7.0.

To readers in the US: happy Thanksgiving! We generally avoid making a security
release just before a major holiday, but we’ve made an exception in this case
because the issue only affects a few sites.

## What’s new

* This release fixes **CVE-2017-0910**: On a server with multiple realms, a
  vulnerability in the invitation system allowed an authorized user of one realm
  to create an account on any other realm. (Thanks to Vishnu Ks for reporting
  and fixing this issue.)
* We’ve updated to the latest translated strings for the Zulip user interface,
  in all languages. We’re especially happy with the progress in the Korean
  translation, from almost nothing in 1.7.0 to 100% complete in 1.7.1. The
  French translation is now nearly complete, and several other languages have
  smaller updates.
* We’ve fixed two issues in the install and upgrade scripts which affected some
  environments.

## Upgrading

If you host multiple realms on your Zulip server, you should upgrade promptly.
See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html#upgrading)
in the Zulip documentation.

If you’re upgrading from 1.7.0, then the code changes are small and there are no
migrations or dependency changes, so the risk of unexpected disruption is low.
Note that because of the fix for CVE-2017-0910, any existing new-user
invitations will be expired; they can be re-sent as needed.

If you’re running a version older than 1.7.0, you should upgrade anyway to get
all the [great features in 1.7](2017/10/25/zulip-server-1-7-released/)! But also
if you have multiple realms, you should upgrade promptly to 1.7.1 to close the
vulnerability. If you need help, best-effort support is available on
[chat.zulip.org, the Zulip community chat server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html).

## Community

We love feedback from the Zulip user community. Here are a few ways you can
connect:

  [chat.zulip.org, the Zulip community Zulip server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html).

This completes the last commit's work to fix [CVE-2017-0910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6r66-34x7-46rg "CVE-2017-0910"), applying
to any invite links already created before the fix was deployed.  With
this change, all new-user registrations must match an explicit realm
in the PreregistrationUser row, except when creating a new realm.
