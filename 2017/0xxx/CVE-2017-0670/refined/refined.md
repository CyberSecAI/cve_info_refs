Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0670:

**CVE-2017-0670**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `bionic` library of Android, specifically in how it handles the unloading of external libraries. When an external library is unloaded, the code fails to properly remove links to parent objects, leading to a use-after-free condition
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Use-after-free vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the process.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by loading and unloading a specially crafted library.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to load and unload libraries on the targeted device. This can be achieved by a malicious application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that when a library is unloaded, the `soinfo_link` is set to the parent.
* The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, and 7.1.2
