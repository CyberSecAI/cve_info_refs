Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0819:

**CVE-2017-0819**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability lies within the `libhevc` library, specifically related to how it handles slice decrement when slices are skipped.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect decrement of the slice counter during the decoding of HEVC video content which results in an out-of-bounds read due to the missing bounds check for a slice that is skipped in video decoding.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, or a potential non-security impact (NSI).
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted HEVC video content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to provide or control the HEVC video content being processed by a vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided code change (`https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libhevc/%2B/87fb7909c49e6a4510ba86ace1ffc83459c7e1b9`) specifically addresses the issue related to the slice decrement for skipped slices in HEVC decoding.
*   The vulnerability is listed as "NSI" with a "High" severity for Android versions 6.0 and 6.0.1 and  "NSI" for versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2 and 8.0.
