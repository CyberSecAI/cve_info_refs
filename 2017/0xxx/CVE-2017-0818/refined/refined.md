Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a memory leak issue found in the `OggExtractor` within the Android Media Framework. Specifically, it occurs when handling Ogg files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Memory Leak:** The core weakness is a memory leak within the `OggExtractor`. This means that memory allocated by the process isn't properly released. This can lead to resource exhaustion over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service condition. If an attacker repeatedly provides a crafted Ogg file to the vulnerable component, it could cause the device to become unresponsive, crash, or eventually run out of memory.
-   **Non-specified impact:**  The entry indicates an "NSI" (Non-Specified Impact). This suggests the exact impact might vary depending on the context and system configuration

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Ogg File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious Ogg file.
-   **File handling:** The vulnerability exists within the component that handles Ogg files. The attacker could provide the malicious file through various methods where an application would parse the file, such as via a media player, or another application utilizing the media framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to provide a crafted Ogg file:** The attacker needs a way to deliver or trigger the processing of their crafted Ogg file on the target device. This could be via a local file, a download from a malicious website, or through another application that has access to media files.
-  **No special privileges**: No elevated privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes references to an AOSP commit ([https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/d07f5c14e811951ff9b411ceb84e7288e0d04aaf](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/d07f5c14e811951ff9b411ceb84e7288e0d04aaf)) that addresses the vulnerability, which involves fixing a memory leak in `OggExtractor`.
- The vulnerability is listed as affecting Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0, where the impact is NSI (Non-Specified Impact), and versions 6.0 and 6.0.1 where the impact is a High severity DoS (Denial of Service).
