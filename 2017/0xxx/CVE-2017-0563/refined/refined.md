  "CVE-2017-0563": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the HTC touchscreen driver could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the HTC touchscreen driver, specifically how it handles access to the I2C bus, allowing for potential unauthorized firmware updates.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control on I2C bus",
      "Lack of firmware signing for the sensor SoC",
	  "Insecure bootloader commands for I2C access"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution in the kernel context, potential permanent device compromise by reflashing the sensor SoC's firmware. This could lead to a loss of device functionality or the ability to monitor and manipulate sensor data.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access: Rebooting the device into fastboot mode and using `fastboot oem` commands via USB",
      "Malicious peripherals: Headphones connected via the headphone jack or malicious chargers exploiting ADB",
	  "Local access (on non-production builds) via /dev/i2c device files"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Physical access to the device, or",
      "Ability to compromise an ADB-enabled device and trigger a reboot",
	  "Local code execution on non-production builds"
    ],
	"Additional Details": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to reflash the firmware of the sensor SoC via the I2C bus, due to the absence of a firmware signing mechanism. The HTC touchscreen driver uses the sensor data to regulate radiation levels. An attacker could leverage the vulnerability to inject malicious firmware, resulting in a loss of functionality or the ability to monitor/manipulate sensor data. The vulnerable bootloader permits I2C bus access using `fastboot oem` commands, and via `HBOOT` using the UART interface (exposed through the headphones jack). The `HBOOT` interface, which provides I2C read and write access, can be reached using the command `reboot oem-42` in the FIQ Debugger. Patched by Google by restricting access to I2C buses in bootloader."
