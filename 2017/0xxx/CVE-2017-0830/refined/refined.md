Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0830:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Android framework that allows a malicious application to bypass user interaction requirements, specifically in the context of granting development permissions. The commit message states "DPC should not be allowed to grant development permission." This suggests that a Device Policy Controller (DPC) was improperly allowed to grant development permissions, which are meant to be more carefully controlled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper permission control:** The core weakness is that the DPC was able to grant permissions (specifically development permissions) that it should not have been authorized to grant. This violates the principle of least privilege.
- **Bypassing user interaction:** The malicious application, by abusing the DPC's capabilities, could bypass the normal user interaction prompts and dialogues that would otherwise be present when granting sensitive permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local malicious application could gain additional permissions, specifically development permissions. This allows the malicious app to perform actions it is not normally authorized to do on the device, potentially leading to more severe compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local malicious application:** The attack vector involves a malicious application installed on the device, which could then leverage this vulnerability.
- **Abuse of Device Policy Controller (DPC):** The vulnerability relies on an improper capability of the DPC to grant development permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to exploit the improper permission control associated with DPC to grant the dangerous development permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is present in the AOSP commit mentioned in the provided text (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/d05d2bac845048f84eebad8060d28332b6eda259).
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0.
- The severity is rated as High.
