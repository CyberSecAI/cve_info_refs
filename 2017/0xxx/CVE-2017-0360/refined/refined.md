**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete patch for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2016-1242).
- Information disclosure due to insufficient sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain access to the contents of files on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The specific attack vector isn't detailed, but it stems from the incomplete patch. It likely involves crafting requests that can bypass the intended security measures.
