Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-0701:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap overflow that occurs while loading HDR files within the `libgdx` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs in the heap memory when handling HDR files. This indicates insufficient bounds checking or incorrect memory allocation when processing HDR image data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the heap overflow could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This means the attacker could gain control of the affected system or application, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted HDR file:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker providing a specially crafted HDR file to a system or application that utilizes the vulnerable `libgdx` library. This could be done via a malicious website, email attachment, or any medium capable of transferring the file to the target.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious HDR file:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the specially crafted HDR file to a target device.
*   **Target must use the vulnerable libgdx library:** The target device must utilize an application that uses the vulnerable version of the `libgdx` library for the exploit to succeed.

**Additional notes:**

* The provided content includes code commits that resolve this issue.
* The vulnerability is rated as High severity.
* The patch was included in the 2017-07-01 security patch level.
