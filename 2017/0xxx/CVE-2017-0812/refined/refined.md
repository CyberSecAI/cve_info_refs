Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0812:

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-0812 is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability found in the Android media framework. Specifically, it involves a flaw in how the decoder handles clips with tiles and large dimensions, which could lead to a tile position exceeding 255, causing issues not supported by the decoder.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from insufficient checks on the size of clips with tiles, specifically when their width and height are greater than or equal to 4096 pixels. In such cases, the CTB (Coding Tree Block) size of 16 can cause the resulting tile position to exceed 255, which is not supported by the decoder.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Integer overflow/out-of-bounds:** The decoder does not properly handle tile positions exceeding the allowed range (255), which leads to a potential out-of-bounds access.
    *   **Insufficient input validation:** The decoder does not validate if the tile position will exceed the decoder's limits before proceeding with the decoding process.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could enable a local malicious application to gain elevated privileges by triggering the vulnerability during the media decoding process, thus bypassing user interaction requirements and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within a privileged context.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted media file that contains clips with tiles that have dimensions greater than or equal to 4096 pixels. A malicious application could use a crafted media file to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A local malicious application needs to be installed on the target device to exploit the vulnerability. No network access or other special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
The fix ensures that the CTB size of 16 does not result in a tile position exceeding 255, by handling cases where clip dimensions are large and tiled.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided commit message indicates that a PoC (Proof of Concept) was used to confirm the vulnerability and the fix prevents a crash. The vulnerability is located within the device/google/dragon component, which indicates that this may be specific to certain hardware.
