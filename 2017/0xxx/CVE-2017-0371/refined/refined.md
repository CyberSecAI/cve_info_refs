Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization for the `attr()` CSS function when used with the `url` type within MediaWiki. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass existing web bug protections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input sanitization of CSS.
- Specifically, the `attr()` CSS function with the `url` type, allowing the inclusion of external URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Web Bug Injection:** An attacker could inject a web bug into a wiki page. This can be used to track users via requests to attacker-controlled servers.
- **Privacy Violation:** By loading external images/resources, the attacker can track users' behavior without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the use of crafted HTML/CSS content, specifically using the `attr()` function with a `url` type in inline styles.
- Example of the vulnerable code:
`<div title="[https://example.org/image.png"](https://example.org/image.png%22) style="background-image: attr(title url);"></div>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject CSS into a wiki page, typically requiring an account with appropriate permissions or exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow content injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was mitigated by blacklisting `attr()` with url.
- The `attr()` function, when used with `url` type, allows specifying a URL that could be from an arbitrary domain.
- The vulnerability existed because the CSS sanitizer failed to block the specific use of `attr()` with `url` type.
- Although no major browser implemented the `attr(foo url)` feature at the time, the patch was applied as a preventive measure.
