# Deep Analysis of Esteemaudit

## *A Windows 2003 RDP Zero Day Exploit*

In this blog, the FortiGuard team takes a look at Esteemaudit, which is an exploit that was included in the set of cybertools leaked by the hacker group known as "Shadow Brokers." They claim that they collected this set of cybertools from the compromised data of "Equation Group," a threat actor alleged to be tied to the United States National Security Agency (NSA).

Esteemaudit is a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploit that targets Microsoft Windows Server 2003 / Windows XP. The vulnerability this RDP exploit targets [will not be patched](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/04/14/protecting-customers-and-evaluating-risk/) since Microsoft has stopped supporting these two products. By exploiting this vulnerability, a threat actor can target a remote RDP Service and eventually take control of the compromised system.

The vulnerability exploited by this attack is related to Smart Card authentication used when logging onto the system via the RDP service.  In this post, we will examine the Windows Smart Card logon mechanism, and figure out the root cause of this vulnerability.

Smart Card logon is supported by all Windows versions after Windows 2000. It contains a chip that stores the user logon information, along with the private key and public certificate key. By inserting it into a Smart Card Reader attached to the computer, and typing in a Personal Identification Number (PIN), a user can securely log onto the Windows system. When logon occurs via the RDP service, the remote machine running the RDP service communicates with the local computer, which then connects to the Smart Card Reader, requests the information in the Smart Card, and verifies the PIN.

This vulnerability is located in the "MyCPAcquireContext()" function in "gpkcsp.dll", which is called by "winlogon.exe" in the new windows session.  The "MyCPAcquireContext()" function is used to set up the Windows Cryptographic Service Providers (CSP) context. It reads the data from the Smart Card and sets the value of the fields of the CSP context structure. If the data read from the Smart Card is overlarge, the field buffer used by CSP context structure overflows and overwrites another field, eventually enabling arbitrary code execution.

First, we’ll run Esteemaudit and check the attack output. Esteemaudit is an executable file used in the FuzzBunch framework. Once it is configured, and the target machine (a Windows Server 2003 SP2 with the Domain Controller configured) is set up correctly, we get the following output:

The configuration:

![](/content/dam/fortinet-blog/new-images/uploads/deep-analysis-of-esteemaudit-2296.jpg)

Here, the ret0c value of 134241925(0x08005e85), is used in the shellcode, and runs just after triggering the vulnerability. We can see it in the following analysis.

The attack output:

![](/content/dam/fortinet-blog/new-images/uploads/deep-analysis-of-esteemaudit-2297.jpg)

Here, the entries "[+]SELECT FILE - Don't care which", "[+]GET\_RSPONSE - from SELECT\_FILE", "READ\_BINARY - start of file", and "[+]Shellcode sent" are all related to the vulnerability and the shellcode. Next, we will explain how they work.

There are three buffer addresses that will be used in our analysis. Receive Buffer "0x80190d8"(invariable) is used to receive the data from the Smart Card, Send Buffer "0x80192d8"(invariable) is used to store the data sent to the local computer with the Smart Card Reader, and CSP context structure Buffer "0x2a6f40"(variable) is the base address of the CSP context structure. The following assembly code snippet was taken from windbg on Windows Server 2003 SP2. Comments added by me have been highlighted.

MyCPAcquireContext initializes the CSP context structure field at first. It sets all the fields as NULL.

Windows uses the driver "Termdd.sys" to communicate with the Smart Card machine in the Windows kernel, according to Smart Card Standard [ISO 7816-4](http://www.cardwerk.com/smartcards/smartcard_standard_ISO7816-4.aspx). "gpkcsp.dll" constructs the command bytes in Send Buffer, and calls "Termdd.sys" to transmit the data. Here, it sends the "SELECT\_FILE" command to the Smart Card machine. The Send Buffer looks like this:

> `080192d8 00 a4 04 00 0b a0 00 00 00 18 0f 00 01 63 00 01`

Here, "a4" means Command type "SELECT\_FILE". This command is used to select a file in the Smart Card, on the common condition, and the data following the Command type indicates the File Identifier. "04 00" means that it will select an application inside the Smart Card directly, but not select a file. The data following that marker is the application ID. The attack output "[+]SELECT FILE - Don't care which " indicates that Esteemaudit receives this command. Esteemaudit then responds with a simple status code, and "MyCPAcquireContext" sends the five-byte "GET RESPONSE" message below:

*080192d8 00 c0 00 00 ff*

Here, "ff" tells the Smart Card that the limit for the Receive Buffer is 0xff, and asks the Smart Card (Esteemaudit simulates a smart card to send data) to send the data related to the above "SELECT FILE" command. It shows "[+]GET\_RSPONSE - from SELECT\_FILE" in the attack output. ]Esteemaudit then sends the data to overwrite the [A0h] field of the CSP context structure.

We can check the message in the Receive Buffer. The message length is 0xb2:

The following is the memory overwritten:

"MyCPAcquireContext" sends the "READ\_BINARY" command to read the file data from the Smart Card, and Esteemaudit sends the shellcode to trigger the vulnerability. It shows  "READ\_BINARY - start of file" and "[+]Shellcode sent" in the attack output.

We can see the shellcode in the Receive Buffer below:

### A Quick Analysis of Microsoft's ESTEEMAUDIT Patch

**And why CVE-2017-0176 and CVE-2017-9073 are probably not the same thing**

By Mitja Kolsek, 0patch Team

As you may know, we at 0patch wrote a [micropatch for Equation Group's ESTEEMAUDIT exploit](https://twitter.com/0patch/status/864819472615571456) last month. It took us quite a while to reproduce the issue until we figured out that the attack only works against computers joined in a Windows domain, but after that, writing a patch was fairly simple. The image below shows its source code and the "Exploit Attempt Blocked" dialog that gets shown when ESTEEMAUDIT attack is detected and blocked.

Our patch is really simple: we check whether the data received from the remote smart card (imitated by ESTEEMAUDIT) is larger than 80h, which is the size of the destination buffer in gpkcsp.dll. If the received data is larger - and with ESTEEMAUDIT it is - we first alert our locally running 0patch agent (which pops up the alert) and then reduce the size of received data to 80h to prevent buffer overflow. This effectively blocks the attack without disrupting legitimate functionality by introducing just 4 machine instructions into the original code.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifabN3hsSMfpL0pnLdlmb7hI1ob_Ia4TL_Kc27aNjJI4LQEKfges1dVUwBFb5GY8Ytu1xAMr_B3_yUmbjUFIAONqqB7RtlyW5jFcGYiU1s9UKYw0pZhuD4GP1o6xRPqFDyOfWt-7YiCszN/s640/ExploitBlocked.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifabN3hsSMfpL0pnLdlmb7hI1ob_Ia4TL_Kc27aNjJI4LQEKfges1dVUwBFb5GY8Ytu1xAMr_B3_yUmbjUFIAONqqB7RtlyW5jFcGYiU1s9UKYw0pZhuD4GP1o6xRPqFDyOfWt-7YiCszN/s1600/ExploitBlocked.png)

About a month later, Microsoft published their [official update for ESTEEMAUDIT and several other vulnerabilities](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/06/13/june-2017-security-update-release/) despite originally indicating that they would only provide these updates to customers with extended support. This is good: official vendor updates are the preferred way to fix vulnerabilities, and 0patch aims to provide most value when fixing issues that have no official fixes, or to provide protection from critical vulnerabilities to organizations in their [security update gap](https://blog.0patch.com/2016/01/bridging-security-update-gap-with-0patch.html).

Naturally, we were interested in how Microsoft fixed this vulnerability and compare their fix to ours. Enter IDA Pro and BinDiff; after a few minutes, we could compare the two side-by-side.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhk_7ygWAxusQ1wJ4ivyXIhod7syvksMiFsOb8SD8m0fq3dkDaIZuwSPSooAqsOutLIJxpVzrlwo5WaI-r0DGYvs29wHV5O7Mx95zkiFHKQLR5-HbcMu416jEiXq7KS9jo-8Om0bwgkVsIP/s640/Microsoft_esteemaudit_patch_2.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhk_7ygWAxusQ1wJ4ivyXIhod7syvksMiFsOb8SD8m0fq3dkDaIZuwSPSooAqsOutLIJxpVzrlwo5WaI-r0DGYvs29wHV5O7Mx95zkiFHKQLR5-HbcMu416jEiXq7KS9jo-8Om0bwgkVsIP/s1600/Microsoft_esteemaudit_patch_2.PNG)

With fixed code on the left, and vulnerable code on the right, it's not-surprisingly obvious that Microsoft's patch also introduces the same check we did, at the exact same location. The main difference between our fixes is that while we just cut the received data to valid length, they spawn an error if the data is too long, and abandon the connection.

This makes sense: an official patch should provide troubleshooting info, wile a micropatch should just close the hole with minimum code.

But surprise: BinDiff shows another change.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTaSnu-hJ9m_7R-fw4zGmTbIoJuPjDiWWTtrYT-qRZWVGMS9DnSQuzuBCpGwczNoyrQ3P7BOm89zbWbcgl503eGXrTAajECshzDn_o7lFZ4WWK1fMBAO1EnzldpsXCL3-MXOsZrufwm8Wg/s640/Microsoft_esteemaudit_patch.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTaSnu-hJ9m_7R-fw4zGmTbIoJuPjDiWWTtrYT-qRZWVGMS9DnSQuzuBCpGwczNoyrQ3P7BOm89zbWbcgl503eGXrTAajECshzDn_o7lFZ4WWK1fMBAO1EnzldpsXCL3-MXOsZrufwm8Wg/s1600/Microsoft_esteemaudit_patch.PNG)

Elsewhere in the code, Microsoft added another similar check, also checking for the received data length exceeding 80h - and responding with an error if so.

They obviously reviewed their code and noticed that a similar bug exists after another DoSCardTransmit call, and fixed it as well. Note that this second bug is *not* exploited by ESTEEMAUDIT, but would likely be found by interested parties based on the first one. Microsoft and other decent software vendors routinely search their code for vulnerabilities similar to those they learn about (either internally or externally), and proactively fix them.

This second bug, however, begs the question: Are there any other similar bugs there?

There are 66 calls to DoSCardTransmit in gpkcsp.dll, and we briefly looked at them. We were interested in cases where the received buffer would be copied to some other buffer. There actually was one such case, apart from those patched by Microsoft, as shown on the image below.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6kKNU5TVGj4QUItQHjdLDr8H3xuzMOcZ8z-oFmwNA-4ThEaZHWq1UJvpgjmVvM2RHQ59SiQx_FUxCkaJEmq3TQPwoCBemSMblwuXsndCtxj6HE45vSE8dBPnEmFjGzJMCsbt-p8whHxeB/s640/Microsoft_esteemaudit_notpatched1.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6kKNU5TVGj4QUItQHjdLDr8H3xuzMOcZ8z-oFmwNA-4ThEaZHWq1UJvpgjmVvM2RHQ59SiQx_FUxCkaJEmq3TQPwoCBemSMblwuXsndCtxj6HE45vSE8dBPnEmFjGzJMCsbt-p8whHxeB/s1600/Microsoft_esteemaudit_notpatched1.PNG)

Again, the latest gpkcsp.dll is on the left side, and apparently no data length check was added to it. The code is suspiciously similar to the vulnerable code, but it really all depends on the size of the destination buffer at ds:[edx+ebx]. We had no time to look further into this but we hope Microsoft did and found it to be non-exploitable.

By the way, the ESTEEMAUDIT vulnerability [was assigned CVE-2017-9073](https://twitter.com/mkolsek/status/865314075605159938) but Microsoft [associates its fix with CVE-2017-0176](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4022747/security-update-for-windows-xp-and-windows-server-2003). This causes some confusion and makes people wonder whether the two CVEs are duplicates. Based on the above analysis of Microsoft's fix, it seems most accurate to say that CVE-2017-9073 is a subset of CVE-2017-0176, the former being only the ESTEEMAUDIT vulnerability and the latter also including the second similar issue that Microsoft also patched.

[Update 2019/4/15: We have subsequently learned that CVE-2017-9073 got marked a duplicate of CVE-2017-0176.]
