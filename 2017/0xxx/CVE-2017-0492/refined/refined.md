  "Vulnerability": {
    "RootCause": "The ViewRoot is constructed on the client side but added to a window token controlled by the NotificationManagerService. When NotificationManagerService#cancelToast is called, the system will remove the window token, and WindowManager needs to destroy the surface to prevent orphaned windows. If the Surface is destroyed before removing the toast on the client side, the ViewRoot may attempt to render after its surface is gone, causing a crash.",
    "Weakness": "Improper handling of toast surface destruction leading to a race condition where rendering might occur after the surface is destroyed",
    "Impact": "A local malicious application could create a UI overlay covering the entire screen.",
    "AttackVector": "A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability.",
    "RequiredCapabilities": "Local malicious application"
  }
