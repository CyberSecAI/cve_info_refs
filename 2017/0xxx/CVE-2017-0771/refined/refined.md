Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Skia library handles large BMP files embedded within ICO files. Specifically, the library attempts to allocate a large amount of memory when it encounters such embedded files, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The vulnerability is triggered by a lack of proper validation of the size of the embedded BMP file within an ICO file. This allows for an attacker to craft a specially designed ICO file that when processed by the Skia library, will attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory.
- **Memory Allocation Vulnerability**: The attempt to allocate a very large memory region can exhaust available resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service condition where the affected application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted ICO file**: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted ICO file containing a large BMP.
- This could be triggered through various scenarios where an application processes image files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted ICO file to the vulnerable application or process.
- The attacker doesn't require local access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit log indicates a fix where the library will not crash if it detects an ICO with an embedded large BMP file and prevent the excessive memory allocation.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the September 2017 Android Security Bulletin.
