  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple crashes in the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library while trying to display text using a corrupted font file or calling documented Uniscribe API functions against such malformed fonts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds reads",
      "Wild reads"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service due to invalid memory read accesses, some at page boundaries, others at seemingly valid, yet unmapped addresses.",
    "attack_vectors": "Processing of malformed font files via the Uniscribe library.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted font file to the Uniscribe library."
  },
  "additional_details": "The report indicates a large number of crashes with different faulting instruction addresses, suggesting a variety of issues within Uniscribe's font processing. The crashes occur in functions such as otlMultiSubstLookup::apply, otlSingleSubstLookup::applyToSingleGlyph, and many others. The issues were reproducible on Windows 7 with PageHeap enabled. The report also notes the need for a custom program to display font glyphs at various sizes and call Uniscribe-specific API functions to trigger the vulnerabilities."
