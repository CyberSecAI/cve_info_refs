Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-0357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `-tr` loader of `iucode-tool`, a utility for manipulating microcode update collections for Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** The vulnerability is triggered when `intel_ucode_scan_for_microcode()` function, used by the `-tr` loader, fails to detect the end-of-buffer condition when a valid microcode is present exactly at the end of the data file being loaded. This leads to the function reading beyond the allocated buffer in memory when scanning for an adjacent microcode.
- **Inadequate bounds checking:** The vulnerability exists due to missing or inadequate checks to ensure that read operations stay within the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault):** In the best-case scenario, exploiting this flaw leads to a segmentation fault, crashing the application.
- **Heap Corruption:** More seriously, an attacker could achieve heap corruption by providing crafted microcode data. This happens because `iucode-tool` may attempt to move microcode regions found within the buffer to the start of the memory area and this process involves potentially overwriting heap memory beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Depending on how the libc's memory allocation functions behave, it might be possible for an attacker to trigger heap corruption that leads to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command-line argument:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `-tr` command-line option of the `iucode-tool`.
- **Crafted microcode data:** An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted microcode data file. The exploit requires a valid microcode region at the end of the data file and possibly additional microcode data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute `iucode-tool`:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `iucode-tool` with the `-tr` option.
- **Control over input data:** The attacker needs to control the microcode data file that is processed by `iucode-tool`.
- **User interaction:** Exploiting the heap corruption might involve tricking the user into executing `iucode-tool` with the malicious crafted data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects `iucode-tool` versions starting from v1.4 up to and including v2.1.
- The fix is present in iucode-tool v2.1.1.
- The issue is considered as an Important severity by SUSE and a Medium severity by Ubuntu.
- The vulnerability can be detected by tools like Valgrind's memcheck or by using `-fsanitize=address` with gcc or clang.
- Patches for the vulnerability have been developed and are available via various sources including the upstream repository and Linux distributions.
