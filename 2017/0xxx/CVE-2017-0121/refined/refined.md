  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by multiple heap out-of-bounds and wild reads in the Windows Uniscribe library while processing malformed font files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap out-of-bounds read",
    "Wild memory read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) due to crashes caused by invalid memory accesses.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted font file designed to trigger the vulnerabilities within the Uniscribe library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a malformed font file to a system using the vulnerable Uniscribe library. This could potentially occur through various means, such as embedding the font in a document or website."
