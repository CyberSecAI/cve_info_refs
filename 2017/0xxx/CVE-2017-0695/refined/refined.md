Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0695:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content includes a commit related to bug ID `37094889` which is the same bug ID referenced in the CVE-2017-0695 entry of the Android Security Bulletin for July 2017. This confirms that the content is relevant to CVE-2017-0695.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs during the search for valid PPS (Picture Parameter Set) within the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) library.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Buffer Overflow:** A heap buffer overflow exists within the `libhevc` library, specifically when searching for a valid PPS. This suggests a lack of proper bounds checking when parsing or processing the data.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability is classified as a DoS. An attacker can trigger a crash or cause the system to become unresponsive by providing a specially crafted HEVC file.
     - The provided patch message states "Fix heap buffer overflow while searching for valid PPS". This confirms the heap buffer overflow leads to a crash, and thus a DoS.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Specially Crafted File:** The attack vector involves using a specially crafted HEVC file. This file would contain malformed data that triggers the buffer overflow.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote Attacker:** The Android Security Bulletin indicates that a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability. This implies that the specially crafted file can be delivered to the vulnerable device through a network or other remote means.
   - **No Privilege Required:** No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, as the parsing process occurs in the context of a process that processes the media file.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The provided commit message includes "Tested POC on ASAN build". ASAN (AddressSanitizer) is a memory error detector, so this indicates that a proof-of-concept (POC) that triggers the vulnerability was developed and tested using ASAN for debugging.
   - The referenced commit messages from android.googlesource.com indicate that the fix involves addressing the buffer overflow directly.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-0695 is a denial-of-service vulnerability caused by a heap buffer overflow in the `libhevc` library. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by delivering a specially crafted HEVC file that triggers the overflow during PPS parsing. This can lead to a crash and denial of service.
