Broadcom produces Wi-Fi HardMAC SoCs which are used to handle the PHY and MAC layer processing. These chips are present in both mobile devices and Wi-Fi routers, and are capable of handling many Wi-Fi related events without delegating to the host OS.

One of the events handled by the BCM firmware is the processing of TDLS connections (802.11z). TDLS connections allow clients to exchange data between one another without passing it through the AP (thus preventing congestion at the AP).

In order to verify the integrity of TDLS messages, each message exchanged between the TDLS peers includes a message integrity code (MIC). The MIC is calculated using AES-CMAC with a key derived during the setup process (TPK-KCK).

When a TDLS Setup Request frame is sent by either one of the peers in an established TDLS connection, the receiving client must verify the MIC before processing the request. The MIC for TDLS Setup Request and TDLS Setup Confirm frames is calculated as follows:

AES-CMAC(TPK-KCK, InitiatorMAC       ||
                  ResponderMAC       ||
                  TransactionSeq     ||
                  LinkID-IE          ||
                  RSN-IE             ||
                  TimeoutInterval-IE ||
                  FastTransition-IE)

(see "wpa_tdls_ftie_mic" under https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/src/rsn_supp/tdls.c)

All TDLS connections are accepted automatically from any peer and are handled solely by the BCM firmware (meaning there is no need for user interaction or involvement in any way - once a TDLS Setup Request is received by the firmware, it will proceed with the TDLS handshake and subsequently create a TDLS connection with the requesting peer).

When the BCM firmware receives a TDLS Setup request frame, it verifies the MIC and responds with a TDLS Setup Response frame. The initiator then sends a TDLS Setup confirm frame in order to establish the connection. The BCM firmware uses the "wlc_tdls_cal_mic_chk" function to calculate the MIC of the received frames (both for the setup and the confirm). When processing the TDLS Setup Request frame, the RSN IE is verified and parsed in order to proceed with the derivation of the TPK. This verification also makes sure that the length of the RSN IE is valid for the chosen encryption type. However, when a TDLS Setup Confirm (M3) message is received, the firmware fails to verify the RSN IE, before calling the "wlc_tdls_cal_mic_chk" function in order to verify the MIC of the incoming frame.

The "wlc_tdls_cal_mic_chk" function allocates a buffer of size 256 on the heap, into which the needed information elements are gathered in order to calculate the AES-CMAC. However, the function does not sufficiently verify the length of the RSN IE included in the Setup Confirm frame. This allows an attacker to include an abnormally large RSN IE, causing a heap-overflow in "wlc_tdls_cal_mic_chk".

Here is the approximate simplified high-level code for the function:

1.  uint8_t* buffer = malloc(256);
2.  uint8_t* pos = buffer;
3.
4.  //Copying the initial (static) information
5.  uint8_t* linkid_ie = bcm_parse_tlvs(..., 101);
6.  memcpy(pos, linkid_ie + 0x8, 0x6);  pos += 0x6;            //Initiator MAC
7.  memcpy(pos, linkid_ie + 0xE, 0x6);  pos += 0x6;            //Responder MAC
8.  *pos = transaction_seq;             pos++;                 //TransactionSeq
9.  memcpy(pos, linkid_ie, 0x14);       pos += 0x14;           //LinkID-IE
10.
11. //Copying the RSN IE
12. uint8_t* rsn_ie = bcm_parse_tlvs(..., 48);
13. if (rsn_ie[1] + 2 + (pos - buffer) > 0xFF) {
14.     ... //Handle overflow
15. }
16. memcpy(pos, rsn_ie, rsn_ie[1] + 2); pos += rsn_ie[1] + 2;  //RSN-IE
17.
18. //Copying the remaining IEs
19. uint8_t* timeout_ie = bcm_parse_tlvs(..., 56);
20. uint8_t* ft_ie      = bcm_parse_tlvs(..., 55);
21. memcpy(pos, timeout_ie, 0x7);       pos += 0x7;            //Timeout Interval IE
22. memcpy(pos, ft_ie, 0x54);           pos += 0x54;           //Fast-Transition IE

As can be seen above, although the function verifies that the RSN IE's length does not exceed the allocated buffer (line 13), it fails to verify that the subsequent IEs also do not overflow the buffer. As such, setting the RSN IE's length to a large value (i.e., such that rsn_ie[1] + 2 + (pos - buffer) == 0xFF) will cause the Timeout Interval and Fast Transition IEs to be copied out-of-bounds, overflowing the buffer.

It should be noted that prior to calculating the MIC, the function in charge of processing the TDLS Setup Confirm frame calls a helper function in order to verify the nonce values in the FTIE (to make sure they match the nonces in the TDLS Setup Request and TDLS Setup Response frames, M1 & M2). However, since the attacker is the initiator of the TDLS connection, they may choose the value of Snonce (bytes [52-84) of the FTIE) arbitrarily. This leaves only the Anonce (bytes [20-52) of the FTIE) as uncontrolled bytes during the overflow, since they are chosen by the responder.

It should also be noted that the heap implementation used in the BCM firmware does not perform safe unlinking or include heap header cookies, allowing heap overflows such as the one described above to be exploited more reliably.

I'm attaching a patch to wpa_supplicant 2.6 which modifies the TDLS Setup Confirm frame sent by the supplicant in order to trigger the heap overflow. You can reproduce the issue by following these steps:

  1. Download wpa_supplicant 2.6 from https://w1.fi/releases/wpa_supplicant-2.6.tar.gz
  2. Apply the included patch file
  3. Build wpa_supplicant (with TDLS support)
  4. Use wpa_supplicant to connect to a network
  5. Connect to wpa_cli:
    5.1. Setup a TDLS connection to the BCM peer using "TDLS_SETUP <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_PEER>"

(Where MAC_ADDRESS_OF_PEER is the MAC address of a peer with a BCM SoC which is associated to the same network).

At this point the heap overflow will be triggered. The code in the patch will corrupt the heap, causing the remote BCM SoC to reset after a while.

I've been able to verify this vulnerability on the BCM4339 chip, running version 6.37.34.40 (as present on the Nexus 5). However, I believe this vulnerability's scope includes a wider range of Broadcom SoCs and versions.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the firmware for
Broadcom BCM43xx wifi chips that may lead to a privilege escalation
or loss of confidentiality.

CVE-2016-0801

    Broadgate Team discovered flaws in packet processing in the
    Broadcom wifi firmware and proprietary drivers that could lead to
    remote code execution.  However, this vulnerability is not
    believed to affect the drivers used in Debian.

CVE-2017-0561

    Gal Beniamini of Project Zero discovered a flaw in the TDLS
    implementation in Broadcom wifi firmware.  This could be exploited
    by an attacker on the same WPA2 network to execute code on the
    wifi microcontroller.

CVE-2017-9417 / #869639

    Nitay Artenstein of Exodus Intelligence discovered a flaw in the
    WMM implementation in Broadcom wifi firmware.  This could be
    exploited by a nearby attacker to execute code on the wifi
    microcontroller.

CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080,
CVE-2017-13081

    Mathy Vanhoef of the imec-DistriNet research group of KU Leuven
    discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the WPA protocol used for
    authentication in wireless networks, dubbed "KRACK".

    An attacker exploiting the vulnerabilities could force the
    vulnerable system to reuse cryptographic session keys, enabling a
    range of cryptographic attacks against the ciphers used in WPA1
    and WPA2.

    These vulnerabilities are only being fixed for certain Broadcom
    wifi chips, and might still be present in firmware for other wifi
    hardware.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
20161130-4~deb8u1.  This version also adds new firmware and packages
for use with Linux 4.9, and re-adds firmware-{adi,ralink} as
transitional packages.

We recommend that you upgrade your firmware-nonfree packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Source:

https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.ca/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html

Broadcom produces Wi-Fi HardMAC SoCs which are used to handle the PHY and MAC layer processing. These chips are present in both mobile devices and Wi-Fi routers, and are capable of handling many Wi-Fi related events without delegating to the host OS.

One of the events handled by the BCM firmware is the processing of TDLS connections (802.11z). TDLS connections allow clients to exchange data between one another without passing it through the AP (thus preventing congestion at the AP).

In order to verify the integrity of TDLS messages, each message exchanged between the TDLS peers includes a message integrity code (MIC). The MIC is calculated using AES-CMAC with a key derived during the setup process (TPK-KCK).

When a TDLS Teardown Request frame is sent by either one of the peers in an established TDLS connection, the receiving client must verify the MIC before processing the request. The MIC for TDLS teardown requests is calculated as follows:

AES-CMAC(TPK-KCK, LinkID-IE || ReasonCode || DialogToken || TransactionSeq || FastTransition-IE)

(see "wpa_tdls_key_mic_teardown" under https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/src/rsn_supp/tdls.c)

It should be noted that all TDLS connections are accepted automatically from any peer and are handled solely by the BCM firmware (meaning there is no need for user interaction or involvement in any way - once a TDLS Setup Request is received by the firmware, it will proceed with the TDLS handshake and subsequently create a TDLS connection with the requesting peer).

When the BCM firmware receives a TDLS Teardown frame, it first verifies the Link-ID information element in order to make sure it matches the current link information. Then, if the Link ID is valid, it calls the "wlc_tdls_cal_teardown_mic_chk" function in order to verify the MIC of the request. The function starts by extracting the Fast Transition IE information element (FTIE - number 55). Then, if the IE is present, its contents are copied into a heap-allocated buffer of length 256. The copy is performed using the length field present in the IE, and at a fixed offset from the buffer's start address. Since the length of the FTIE is not verified prior to the copy, this allows an attacker to include a large FTIE (e.g., with a length field of 255), causing the memcpy to overflow the heap-allocated buffer.

Here's the high-level logic of the "wlc_tdls_cal_teardown_mic_chk" function:

uint8_t* buffer = malloc(256);
...
uint8_t* linkid_ie = bcm_parse_tlvs(..., 101);
memcpy(buffer, linkid_ie, 0x14);
...
uint8_t* ft_ie = bcm_parse_tlvs(..., 55);
memcpy(buf + 0x18, ft_ie, ft_ie[1] + 2);

(Note that each IE is a TLV; the tag and value fields are each a single byte long. Therefore, ft_ie[1] is the IE's length field).

It should also be noted that the heap implementation used in the BCM firmware does not perform safe unlinking or include heap header cookies, allowing heap overflows such as the one described above to be exploited more reliably.

I'm attaching a patch to wpa_supplicant 2.6 which modifies the TDLS Teardown frame sent by the supplicant in order to trigger the heap overflow. You can reproduce the issue by following these steps:

  1. Download wpa_supplicant 2.6 from https://w1.fi/releases/wpa_supplicant-2.6.tar.gz
  2. Apply the included patch file
  3. Build wpa_supplicant (with TDLS support)
  4. Use wpa_supplicant to connect to a network
  5. Connect to wpa_cli:
    5.1. Setup a TDLS connection to the BCM peer using "TDLS_SETUP <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_PEER>"
    5.2. Teardown the connection using "TDLS_TEARDOWN <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_PEER>"

(Where MAC_ADDRESS_OF_PEER is the MAC address of a peer with a BCM SoC which is associated to the same network).

At this point the heap overflow will be triggered. The code in the patch will corrupt the heap, causing the remote BCM SoC to reset after a while.

I've been able to verify this vulnerability on the BCM4339 chip, running version 6.37.34.40 (as present on the Nexus 5). However, I believe this vulnerability's scope includes a wider range of Broadcom SoCs and versions.

################################################################################

Attaching exploit - running exploit.py results in arbitrary code-execution on the Wi-Fi dongle.

Here is a high-level overview of the exploit:

  1. Create a TDLS connection to the target device
  2. Teardown the connection using a crafted "TDLS Teardown Request" frame, triggering the overflow
  3. Create a new TDLS connection, using crafted arguments causing a situation where two chunks in
     the freelist overlap one another
  4. Send a TDLS frame with action code 127
    4.1. Craft the size of the TDLS frame s.t. it overlaps the other chunk in the freelist
    4.2. Craft the contents in order to point the free chunk to the location of a periodic timer
         which was created during the firmware's initialization
  5. Send another TDLS frame with action code 127
    5.1. Craft the size of the TDLS frame s.t. it will be placed on top of the timer object
    5.2. Craft the contents in order to replace the timer's data structures, allowing us to point
         the timer's handler function at any arbitrary address. In this case, we point the handler
         function at an address near the heap's end
  6. Send a large TDLS frame with action code 127
    6.1. Craft the frame's contents so that it contains the shellcode we'd like to execute
  7. Since the heap is zero-initialized, and "00 00" is NOP (MOVS R0,R0) in Thumb, this means that
     jumping to a location slightly before our created code chunk is fine, as it won't cause any
     adverse affects until we reach our code blob. Putting all this together, Once the timer
     expires, our code chunk is executed on the firmware

Note that sending crafted "TDLS Teardown Request" frames requires modifications to wpa_supplicant.
Moreover, sending TDLS frames with action code 127 requires modifications to both wpa_supplicant
and to the Linux Kernel (mac80211).

These changes (and instructions on how to apply them) are included in the exploit archive attached
to this comment.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
