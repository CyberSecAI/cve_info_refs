{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `USP10!otlList::insertAt` function when processing a corrupted font file, specifically during the `memmove` operation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. The vulnerability leads to a crash due to an access violation when displaying text using a corrupted font file. Although it is described as a DoS, it could potentially be leveraged for more severe impacts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted or corrupted font file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to deliver a corrupted font file to a vulnerable system and cause it to be processed by the Uniscribe library, potentially through a website or malicious document."
