Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `GateKeeperResponse` class had inconsistent `writeToParcel()` and `createFromParcel()` methods. This allowed a malicious app to create a `Bundle` that changes content after serialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inconsistent serialization/deserialization logic, leading to a vulnerability where data can be altered after it has been serialized.
- Potential for data tampering by an attacker in a manner not intended by the developers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious application could craft a `Bundle` that modifies its content after serialization.
- This crafted `Bundle` could then be used to execute `Intents` with system privileges, leading to unauthorized actions.
- An attacker could bypass user interaction requirements to gain additional permissions, which could result in elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious application exploiting the inconsistency in `GateKeeperResponse` methods.
- Sending crafted `Bundles` that change content after serialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A malicious application installed on the target device.
- The ability to create and manipulate `Bundles` with malicious intent.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit log includes a reference to a test using a debug app to verify this fix.
- The Android Security Bulletin indicates this vulnerability was addressed in the 2017-10-01 security patch level and affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0
