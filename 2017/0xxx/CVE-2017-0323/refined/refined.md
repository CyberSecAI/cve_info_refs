The provided content is related to CVE-2017-0323.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A NULL pointer dereference caused by invalid user input in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver kernel mode layer handler.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- The driver fails to properly validate user-provided input.
- This lack of validation leads to a NULL pointer dereference when processing the invalid input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS)
- Potential escalation of privileges

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the kernel mode layer handler of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver.
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing invalid input to the driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the driver and provide the invalid input.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with low privileges.
