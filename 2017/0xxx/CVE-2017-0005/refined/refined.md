  "CVE-2017-0005": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "This article discusses a zero-day elevation of privilege (EoP) exploit targeting older versions of Windows (7 and 8) by exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-0005) in the Windows Win32k component. The exploit corrupts a pointer in the PALETTE.pfnGetNearestFromPalentry function, allowing the attacker to execute code in the kernel and gain system privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Windows *Win32k* component, specifically a corrupted pointer in the *PALETTE.pfnGetNearestFromPalentry* function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a corrupted function pointer in the kernel allowing arbitrary code execution."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate process privileges, gaining SYSTEM level access. This could result in complete control over the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The exploit uses a four-stage process starting with a decryption routine. It checks the OS version to ensure it's on a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is triggered via a call to NtGdiEngBitBlt, which eventually uses the corrupted function pointer to execute shellcode."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system. No specific user privileges are mentioned to be required prior to exploitation. The exploit was designed for 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8.",
        "additional_details": "The exploit uses API resolution routines that resemble position-independent code, dynamically constructs syscall code snippets, and utilizes a common token-swapping technique to elevate privileges. The article also details the mitigations in place in newer operating systems, such as Windows 10, including SMEP, 64-bit ASLR improvements, and virtualization-based security (VBS). It also shows how Windows Defender ATP can detect token swapping attempts."
