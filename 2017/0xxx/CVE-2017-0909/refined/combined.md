Sorry, something went wrong.

[@reedloden](https://github.com/reedloden) I plan on adding comments in just a bit. On top of that, this PR doesn't even include tests so it isn't ready for merging quite yet.

| Sorry for the delay, for some reason I wasn't getting any notifications from GitHub for this repo. I think this looks good. My only feedback is that the quotes are inconsistent. The rest of the gem uses double quotes so it would be good to do that here. |
