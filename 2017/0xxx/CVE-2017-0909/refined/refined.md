Based on the content, here's the information related to CVE-2017-0909:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incomplete blacklist of private IP addresses within the `private_address_check` Ruby gem. The initial implementation failed to include certain IP address ranges that should have been considered private, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The main vulnerability is an insufficient blacklist for private IP addresses. The library uses a blacklist approach instead of a whitelist which by its nature is prone to bypasses if the blacklist is not exhaustive. This allows requests to private IP addresses to be made when they should be blocked.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a variety of attacks, depending on the usage context of the vulnerable gem.  A common example would be SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks, where an attacker could potentially use the vulnerable application to make requests to internal services not intended to be publicly accessible. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, unauthorized access to internal resources, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is through the `private_address_check` gem. An attacker would need to control the IP address being checked by the application. If this address is not properly validated, they could use a private address that isn't in the blacklist.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the `private_address_check` gem with a private IP address that was not previously blacklisted, meaning the attacker needs to control the destination of the request. This could be done by exploiting a vulnerability in another part of the application or by tricking the user into submitting such a request. The attacker also needs to have a network position that can access the internal network to which the private address refers.

**Additional Details:**
The pull request #3 in the repository `jtdowney/private_address_check` which is discussed in the document provides the resolution of the vulnerability. The discussion between contributors highlights the issues of incomplete blacklists, the changes made include additional private IP address ranges and the discussion mentions that the vulnerability is CVE-2017-0909.
