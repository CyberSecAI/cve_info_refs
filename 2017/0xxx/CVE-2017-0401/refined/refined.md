Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the "Effect" command handles array indexing. Specifically, it's possible to provide a negative index, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The code fails to properly validate the provided index values, allowing negative numbers which should be invalid.
*   **Out-of-bounds Access:** By allowing negative indexing, the code accesses memory outside the allocated bounds of the array being processed by the "Effect" command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure**: The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure as an attacker might read data from unintended memory locations.
*  **Potential Code Execution**: Depending on how the out-of-bounds read is handled, there's a potential for more serious consequences, such as code execution. While the text describes this as a moderate impact, out-of-bounds reads can often be leveraged for more severe impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the "Effect" command.
*   An attacker would need to craft an input to the command that includes a negative array index.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable "Effect" command and must be able to control/influence the index values passed to the command. This typically implies a local attacker who can interact with the system and call the vulnerable functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit logs indicate this vulnerability was addressed by fixing the "Equalizer command" and the "Effect command," suggesting that other similar indexing issues existed and were corrected as part of the fix for this issue.
*   The bug IDs provided (32448258, 32095626) link to the specific code changes.
