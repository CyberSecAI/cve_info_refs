Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-0389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in core networking, specifically during DHCP packet processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A denial-of-service vulnerability exists due to improper handling of specially crafted network packets during DHCP processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a device hang or reboot. This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the device.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted network packet, likely a DHCP packet, to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the target device.
- No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned other than the ability to craft and send a malicious network packet.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes multiple AOSP commit links that address this issue, showing the fix involved adding try/catch blocks around DHCP packet parsing logic to prevent crashes.
- This vulnerability is considered high severity due to the possibility of a remote denial of service.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Android versions including 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1.
