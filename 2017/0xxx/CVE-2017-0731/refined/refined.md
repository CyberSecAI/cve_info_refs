Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `libstagefright_soft_mpeg4enc` component. The code allocates a buffer, adjusts a pointer to use it, and is supposed to adjust the pointer back when freeing the memory. The problem is that the adjustment was based on user-supplied values. If these values were modified between allocation and free, the code would end up freeing the wrong memory address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory management, specifically an incorrect address being passed to `free()`.
- Reliance on user-provided values for pointer arithmetic without proper validation or sanitization between allocation and deallocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP). A malicious application could exploit this flaw to potentially gain elevated privileges, allowing it to perform actions that it should not be authorized to do, due to freeing an arbitrary address.
- The vulnerability is classified as High severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local malicious application can use a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the affected device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves keeping an extra pointer to the original unmodified allocation, which is used for subsequent `free()` calls, making the free operation independent of user-provided values.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Android versions from 4.4.4 to 7.1.2.
