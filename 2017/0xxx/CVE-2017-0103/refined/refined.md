{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause is unknown, but the crashes occur when loading corrupted registry hive files. Specifically, the crashes occur in nt!nt!HvpGetBinMemAlloc and nt!ExpFindAndRemoveTagBigPages functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of corrupted registry hive files.",
       "Memory corruption due to improper memory management while loading a corrupted registry hive."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash/bugcheck).",
    "attack_vectors": "Loading specially crafted, corrupted registry hive files.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to load registry hives. The exploit requires sequential loading of multiple corrupted hives from the same path."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The issue reproduces on Windows 7 32- and 64-bit, and manifests itself both with and without Special Pools. Reproduction can be unreliable with a single corrupted hive; sequential loading of several corrupted hives from the same path is necessary to reliably trigger the crash."
