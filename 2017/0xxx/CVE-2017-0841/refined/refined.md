  "CVE-2017-0841": {
    "description": "The most severe vulnerability in this section could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in utf{16,32}_to_utf8_length function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow leading to a small return value that cannot hold the converted data.",
      "Lack of explicit check on return value."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability lies within the `utf{16,32}_to_utf8_length` function. Without an explicit check, the return value can wrap around, resulting in a value too small to hold the converted data from the resulting conversion. There is no CTS test for this because it would require allocating at least `SSIZE_MAX / 2` bytes of UTF-16 data, which is unreasonable on 64-bit devices."
