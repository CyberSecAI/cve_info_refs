{
  "Root cause": "Multiple heap out-of-bounds and wild reads in the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library while processing corrupted font files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Heap out-of-bounds read",
    "Wild memory reads"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to crashes caused by invalid memory access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a malformed font file using Uniscribe API functions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to supply or trigger the processing of a specially crafted/corrupted font file.",
   "Additional details": "The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, causing crashes at multiple locations within the Uniscribe library (USP10.dll). The provided list shows function call stack locations that were hit by the fuzzer with various invalid memory READ accesses. Some of the crashes occur at page boundaries, while others are at seemingly valid yet non-mapped addresses. The crashes can be reliably reproduced by enabling PageHeap for the test program and by using a custom program which displays all of the fontâ€™s glyphs at various point sizes and calls Uniscribe-specific API functions. The issue affects Windows 7 and potentially other versions as well. The source of this information is the Google Project Zero bug tracker."
