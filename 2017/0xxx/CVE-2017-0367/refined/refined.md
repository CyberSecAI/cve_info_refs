{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's LocalisationCache using the system's temporary directory (/tmp) as a fallback location for storing cache files. This is insecure because different MediaWiki installations on the same server can potentially overwrite each other's cache files, leading to data corruption or other issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe use of temporary directory",
      "Insecure default configuration",
      "Potential for cache poisoning/overwrite"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious content into the localization cache. Because the cache is unserialized this could lead to arbitrary code execution as the web user. In a shared hosting environment, other users on the same system could potentially insert malicious cache files to affect other installations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting a malicious cache file",
      "Local access to the shared temporary directory"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create files in the system's temporary directory and have some knowledge of the target system to craft malicious cache files.",
     "affected_versions": "MediaWiki versions before 1.28.1 and 1.27.2 are affected. Version 1.23 is not affected.",
     "fix_versions": "The vulnerability is fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.28.1 and 1.27.2."
