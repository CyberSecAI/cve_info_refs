Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0842:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-0842

**Description:**

*   The vulnerability is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) issue found in the `system/bt` component of Android.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `free_sdp_slot()` function within the Bluetooth stack.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `free_sdp_slot()` function does not properly validate the 'id' parameter before using it to free a slot, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper input validation:** The lack of validation on the `id` parameter allows an attacker to provide an out-of-bounds index.
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** This results in memory corruption by attempting to write to a memory location that is outside of the intended buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially gain elevated privileges by exploiting the out-of-bounds write which can lead to arbitrary code execution in a privileged process.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
*   The application needs to have the capability to interact with the Bluetooth stack.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided commit message from android.googlesource.com indicates a fix was made to check the 'id' parameter before freeing the slot, addressing the root cause.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0, as per the Android Security Bulletin.
