Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-0851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing out-of-bounds check on the `u4_num_bufs` variable within the `ps_dec_ip->s_out_buffer` structure during input argument processing in the libhevc library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The lack of proper bounds checking on `u4_num_bufs` when accessing `s_out_buffer` could lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The CVE description classifies this as an ID vulnerability which means an attacker could potentially read memory outside the intended buffer, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input to the affected code. The specific type of input is not detailed but would presumably involve a malformed HEVC stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious input to the media framework or any application using the affected library. This could be achieved through a malicious media file or other media input methods.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `libhevc` library.
- The fix is in the form of an additional bounds check being added to `u4_num_bufs` when accessing `s_out_buffer`.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2 and 8.0
