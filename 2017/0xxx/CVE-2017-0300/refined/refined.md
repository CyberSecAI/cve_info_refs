{
  "CVE-2017-0300": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability lies in the `nt!NtQueryInformationWorkerFactory` system call when used with the `WorkerFactoryBasicInformation` information class. It discloses uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.",
    "root_cause": "The system call `nt!NtQueryInformationWorkerFactory` with the `WorkerFactoryBasicInformation` info class copies data from kernel stack to user mode without properly initializing all bytes in the output structure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially defeat exploit mitigations such as kernel ASLR by reading kernel memory or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space by repeatedly triggering the vulnerability. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local, authenticated attacker can call the vulnerable system call `nt!NtQueryInformationWorkerFactory` with a specific information class.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local, authenticated user. They do not need any special privileges beyond the ability to make system calls."
