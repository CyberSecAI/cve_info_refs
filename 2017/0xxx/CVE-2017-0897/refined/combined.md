* Developers
  + The Localize class has been rewritten to use PHP’s DateTime class
    for better localization and daylight savings time handling.
  + Added `Localize::string_to_timestamp` method for converting a pre-
    localized or non-localized time string into a Unix timestamp.
  + Added `Localize::format_date` to convert a Unix timestamp into a
    formatted date string.
  + `Localize::$now` property now accounts for server offset.
  + Changed the CP view file structure to inherit from a master
    template. Please check your view file overrides.
  + Added global `ee()` function for easy access to the EE super
    object.

    successful, which may have implications for success messages.

    manually clear parameters.

    explicitly set.
  + Channel Entries API will use current time as the default entry date
    when adding or updating an entry if the entry date is not explicitly
    set.

    changes far more fault-tolerant.
  + Added an update log to record notices, exceptions, and failures from
    the Updater.

  + Turned on Show SQL Queries and Template Debugging by default in a

    characters removed).

    to create a Custom Member Field.
