```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `vp9_init_macroblockd()` function resets the error_info to a global copy, but this needs to be set to the thread-level target to prevent incorrect stack jumps leading to hangs or crashes.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Incorrect target for error_info reset in `vp9_init_macroblockd()`.

Impact of exploitation:
- Device hang or crash.

Attack vectors:
- Specially crafted media files that trigger the vulnerable code path in VP9 decoding.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to provide a crafted media file to the vulnerable device.
