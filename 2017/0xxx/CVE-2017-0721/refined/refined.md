Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an error in parsing frame headers within the `libmpeg2` library, specifically when dealing with width/height parameters that are parsed as zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer parsing flaw: The code doesn't handle zero values for width/height parameters correctly leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution due to incorrect memory handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
-  Denial of Service (DoS):  The vulnerability may also lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted media file containing a header with zero width/height values which triggers the flawed parsing logic during media processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious media file to the target device. This can be achieved through various means such as malicious websites, downloaded files, or other file transfer mechanisms.
