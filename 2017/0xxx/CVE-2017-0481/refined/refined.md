{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The destination memory for copying data in `nfc_ncif_proc_activate` is allocated with a predetermined maximum length. However, in certain cases, the length of the information being copied can exceed this maximum, leading to a memory overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory overflow due to insufficient length check before copying data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The memory overflow causes a crash due to writing beyond the allocated buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "Reading and writing a tag with a larger-than-expected information length can trigger the overflow.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in close proximity to the device to interact with the NFC interface."
