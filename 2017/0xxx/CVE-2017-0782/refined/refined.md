| CVE-2017-0782 | [A-63146237](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/4e47f3db62bab524946c46efe04ed6a2b896b150) [[2](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/1b08775917413f1674882130a948add1ae44cc91)] [[3](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/c568fa9088ded964e0ac99db236e612de5d82177)] | RCE | Critical | 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0 |

The CVE ID matches the specified CVE, and the description indicates a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerability is located in the Bluetooth component of Android system.

**Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing check for packet length while parsing BNEP (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol) control packets within the Android Bluetooth stack. This lack of proper bounds checking can lead to a buffer overflow. The commit logs from the source code changes mention that there is a missing check for PAN (Personal Area Network) buffer size before copying data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow can be triggered due to the missing bounds check when parsing BNEP control packets.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows a nearby attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This means an attacker could gain full control over a vulnerable device if the vulnerability is successfully exploited.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Bluetooth:** The attack vector is through the Bluetooth interface. An attacker needs to be within the Bluetooth range of the target device to attempt exploitation. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted BNEP control packets.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be in close proximity to the target device, within Bluetooth range.
    *   **Bluetooth Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted Bluetooth BNEP packets.
    *   **Privilege:** The vulnerability is within a privileged process.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" severity, highlighting the severe nature of the potential impact.
*   The provided content includes commit logs that describe adding checks for missing packet length and a missing check for PAN buffer size before copying data. This suggests that the fix involves implementing proper bounds checking and validation on the received BNEP control packets.
*   The content lists the affected AOSP versions, ranging from Android 4.4.4 through 8.0. This indicates the vulnerability affected multiple versions of the Android operating system.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Ben Seri and Gregory Vishnepolsky of Armis, Inc., as noted in the "Acknowledgements" section of the Android Security Bulletin.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-0782 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Android Bluetooth stack that arises due to a missing length check while parsing BNEP control packets. This can lead to a buffer overflow, allowing a nearby attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Response:**

```
Root cause of vulnerability: Missing check for packet length while parsing BNEP control packets, resulting in a buffer overflow.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow.
Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution allowing an attacker to gain full control of the device.
Attack vectors: Bluetooth interface, via specially crafted BNEP control packets.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker must be within Bluetooth range and be able to send crafted BNEP packets.
