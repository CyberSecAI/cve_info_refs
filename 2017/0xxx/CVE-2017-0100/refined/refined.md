{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The COM session moniker allows a user to specify the interactive session that’s to be used when a DCOM object is registered with an AppID with RunAs of “Interactive User”. The DCOM activator does not check if the current user has permission to switch sessions when activating an object using the session moniker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient privilege check when activating a DCOM object using the session moniker",
       "Lack of restriction on using session moniker to instantiate a DCOM object in another user's session."
    ],
    "impact": "A user can instantiate a DCOM object inside another user's session on the same machine and execute arbitrary processes in the context of the other user in their session, leading to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Exploiting the COM session moniker"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute code on the target machine with a non-administrator user account."
