  "cveId": "CVE-2017-0086",
  "description": "The provided content from exploit-db.com describes a heap memory corruption vulnerability in the Uniscribe library (USP10.dll) related to font processing.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `USP10!otlCacheManager::GlyphsSubstituted` function when processing a corrupted font file. Specifically, a `memset` or `memcpy` operation attempts to write to an invalid memory location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap memory corruption",
        "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to an access violation and program crash. The provided crash analysis shows the crash occurs during a `memcpy` operation within the `msvcrt!_VEC_memcpy` function, while trying to process a corrupted font file",
    "attackVectors": "By displaying text using a crafted, corrupted font file. The vulnerable code path is triggered during font processing and glyph substitution.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to provide or trick the victim into using a specially crafted font file. This could be achieved through various means such as embedding the font in a document, website, or application."
