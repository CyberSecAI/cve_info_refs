Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0852:

**CVE-2017-0852**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `libhevc` library. This library is used for decoding HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) video streams.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted HEVC video stream. This could involve a malicious video file or a manipulated stream received over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need the ability to provide a malicious HEVC stream to the vulnerable device. This could be achieved through various means, including tricking a user into opening a malicious file or via network access.

**Additional Details (From Source Code Commit):**
*   The commit message "RESTRICT AUTOMERGE Fix heap buffer overflow" and the test details indicates that the fix was implemented to address a heap buffer overflow, confirming the vulnerability.
*   The provided test case (`push multi_rec.hevc`, build `external/libhevc`, run `hevcdec --input multi_res.hevc --num_frames -1 --num_cores 2`) shows how to trigger this vulnerability on a device.

The provided content confirms that CVE-2017-0852 is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `libhevc` library, leading to denial of service.
