Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-0548:

**CVE-2017-0548**

*   **Root Cause:** A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the libskia library due to incorrect handling of bitmap data size reporting by RLE encoded bitmaps. The library would attempt to allocate a buffer of a size based on a potentially invalid size report within an RLE bitmap.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect Size Calculation**: RLE bitmaps can report a very large, or incorrect, number of bytes they should contain.
    *   **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The libskia library would attempt to allocate a buffer based on this potentially incorrect size report. This could lead to the allocation of very large memory buffers.
   
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Allocation of very large buffers leads to excessive memory consumption potentially causing the system to hang or reboot due to memory exhaustion or an OOM (Out Of Memory) condition.
    
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Specially Crafted Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious image file with a specifically malformed RLE bitmap which causes an incorrect size to be reported.
    *  **Remote Denial of Service**: This can be triggered remotely when processing such a crafted file (e.g. via a web browser or other media handling application).
    
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted RLE bitmap file to the vulnerable software (e.g. user viewing a malicious webpage with the crafted image, or through any application which processes media.)

**Additional Details from the commit log:**

*   The commit log from android.googlesource.com clarifies that the issue is specifically in how RLE bitmaps report the number of bytes they should contain, which may be incorrect or a very large number.
*   Previously, the code would attempt to buffer all reported bytes, potentially leading to large memory allocation, including up to 4GB which is noted as unnecessary and may lead to OOM issues.
*   The fix implements a fixed-size buffer instead of allocating based on the reported size, limiting the allocation and relying on existing code to refill the buffer if more data is available.
*   The fix introduces a test with a specific image that reports a large byte size to ensure the fix works correctly.
