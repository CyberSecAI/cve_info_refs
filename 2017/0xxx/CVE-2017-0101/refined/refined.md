{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the win32k component related to palette management.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free",
    "Integer overflow (potentially related to memory allocation)",
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges (SYSTEM).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a local attacker through a series of carefully crafted GDI calls that manipulate bitmaps, palettes and window classes. The vulnerability is triggered by calling `PolyPatBlt` after freeing the bitmap object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to execute code locally on the vulnerable machine."
