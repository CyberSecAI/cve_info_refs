```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of header decode errors in the libmpeg2 library. If header decoding fails, the code should not proceed to attempt decoding a frame, avoiding potential memory corruption.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption due to improper handling of header decode errors.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted media file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted media file to be processed by the vulnerable Mediaserver process. This could occur via email, web browsing or MMS.",
  "Additional Information": "The fix also includes an initialization of pic_wd and pic_ht for reinitialization when the decoder is created with smaller dimensions."
