{
  "CVE-2017-0900": {
    "description": "rubygems: No size limit in summary length of gem spec",
    "root_cause": "The rubygems client does not limit the size of the gem specification summary field when processing a gem, which could cause excessive CPU usage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service",
      "Resource Consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition by providing a gem with a very large summary field, potentially freezing a rubygems client attempting to process it.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Malicious Gem Repository"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to provide a malicious gem repository with a crafted gem can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is in the way rubygems parses the summary length of a gemspec. An overly long 'summary' field can cause excessive CPU usage leading to a denial of service. The fix involves truncating overly long summaries to 100,000 characters."
