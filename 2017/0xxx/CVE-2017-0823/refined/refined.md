Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0823:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Radio Interface Layer (RIL) code specifically within the `RIL_DIAL` functionality, which handles making phone calls.
- The code had a flaw related to how it handles setup data calls, and was missing a check for the maximum address length in RIL_DIAL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability allows for information disclosure. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of data calls and a missing length check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information.
- Although the severity is rated as "Moderate," any information disclosure vulnerability has the potential to be chained with other vulnerabilities leading to greater impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the `RIL_DIAL` functionality.
- It appears a crafted RIL request, specifically involving setup data calls with excessive address length could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would likely need to be able to send crafted RIL requests to the vulnerable device. The exact mechanism to send these requests and the required level of access is not stated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves removing incorrect code related to `setup_data_call` and adding a check for the maximum address length in `RIL_DIAL`.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Android versions from 4.4.4 up to 7.1.2.

The information from the commit logs provides more technical context about the fix, specifically about handling setup data calls and the missing length check in RIL_DIAL.
