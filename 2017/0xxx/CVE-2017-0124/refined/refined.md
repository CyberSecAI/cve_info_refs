  "cve": "CVE-2017-0124",
  "description": "Multiple heap out-of-bounds and wild read vulnerabilities exist in the Windows Uniscribe font processing library when displaying text using corrupted font files. These issues are triggered by various invalid memory read accesses when calling documented Uniscribe API functions against malformed fonts.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Corrupted font files processed by Uniscribe library result in invalid memory read accesses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds read",
      "Wild read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to crashes caused by invalid memory accesses. The crashes occur at various locations within the Uniscribe library.",
        "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted or corrupted font files.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to display text using a corrupted font file, either directly or via documented Uniscribe API functions."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Windows Uniscribe user-mode library"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The sheer amount of crashes discovered made it difficult to assess the root cause, severity and impact of each of them within a reasonable time-frame. A custom program that displays all the font's glyphs at various point sizes and calls Uniscribe API functions is needed to trigger the vulnerabilities. PageHeap is encouraged to get reliable reproductions."
