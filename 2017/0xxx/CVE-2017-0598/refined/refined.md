{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Framework APIs of Android due to insufficient bounds checking in the offsetToPtr method.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application can bypass operating system protections and gain access to data that it should not have access to.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "patch_details": "The patch checks whether the specified offset belongs to mData and also adds a default argument bufferSize to check the end offset. The createFromParcel method was updated to check ashmem size immediately after memory is mapped.",
    "extra_info": "The vulnerability is related to how offset is handled when memory is mapped and data is parsed, which could lead to reading out-of-bounds memory if not checked properly."
