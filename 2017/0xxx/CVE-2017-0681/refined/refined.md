Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0681:

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-0681 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting the Tremolo library in Android. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process by using a specially crafted file.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is located within the `tremolo` library. The provided commit message associated with the fix (A-37208566), states "Decoder: Fix end of bitstream error." This suggests an issue with how the `tremolo` library handles the end of a bitstream when decoding, possibly leading to a buffer overflow or use-after-free condition. More specifically, the fix addresses an error check for the end of the bitstream and fixes the calculation for the number of macroblocks in Mbaff frames, which may have contributed to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Improper Bitstream Handling:** The core issue stems from the library's incorrect handling of bitstream termination or incorrect parsing of the stream.
-   **Buffer Overflow/Use-after-free:**  While not explicitly stated, given the impact and fix description, it is likely the vulnerability is triggered via a buffer overflow or use-after-free due to the incorrect bitstream handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's device.
-   **Privileged Process Context:** The code is executed within the context of a privileged process, meaning that the attacker can gain significant control over the device.
-   **Complete Device Compromise:** The ability to execute code within a privileged process can lead to full device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Specially Crafted File:** Attackers must provide a specially crafted file that can trigger the vulnerability when processed by the Tremolo library. This file is likely some form of audio file.
-   **Remote Attack:**  The bulletin specifies the vulnerability is remotely exploitable. This means the malicious file could be delivered over the network through various means, such as MMS, email, or via a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Deliver Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted file to the target device which uses the tremolo library. This delivery could be through methods mentioned in the attack vectors above.
-   **No Special Privileges Initially:** No special access or privileges are required before the exploit. The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have physical access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Android (4.4.4 - 7.1.2)
-   The vulnerability is rated as Critical
