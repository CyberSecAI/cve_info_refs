  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-0876",
      "description": "If a webp file is truncated such that no rows can be decoded, WebPIDecGetRGB does not initialize its last_y parameter. rowDecoded (passed as last_y) is used to determine which remaining rows to fill. Check the return value of WebPIDecGetRGB. If it fails (returns null) or rowsDecoded is <= 0 (matching Chromium's check), return kInvalidInput, since there is nothing to draw.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of initialization of the `last_y` parameter in `WebPIDecGetRGB` when a WebP file is truncated, leading to an uninitialized value being used in calculations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized variable: The `last_y` parameter is not initialized in certain failure cases.",
        "Incorrect handling of truncated files: The code doesn't properly handle WebP files that are truncated such that no rows can be decoded."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a crash or execute arbitrary code by providing a specially crafted, truncated WebP file that triggers the use of an uninitialized `last_y` parameter.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted truncated WebP file"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted WebP file to an application that uses the vulnerable WebP decoding library."
