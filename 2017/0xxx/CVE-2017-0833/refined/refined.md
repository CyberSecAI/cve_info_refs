  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2017-0833",
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a memory copy issue. The fix replaces memcyp with memmove to avoid the memcyp-param-overlap error.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Memory overlap error due to using memcyp instead of memmove."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Specially crafted media file."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "Remote attacker capable of crafting a malicious media file."
      ],
       "More Details": "The provided commit message indicates that the fix replaces `memcyp` with `memmove` to resolve a memory overlap error. This suggests that the original code used `memcyp` (likely a typo for `memcpy`) in a way that could lead to memory corruption if the source and destination regions overlapped. The fix ensures that memory is moved correctly even if the source and destination regions overlap."
