```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - The vulnerability lies in the implementation of unpacking the results of a RemQueryInterface2 (RQI2) request in `CStdMarshal::Finish_RemQIAndUnmarshal2`. Specifically, `CStdMarshal::UnmarshalInterface` unmarshals the interface from the OBJREF stream using the IID present in the OBJREF, rather than the IID requested in the RQI2 call. This leads to a type confusion if the IIDs do not match.
  - The vulnerability is triggered when a caller queries for an interface on an out-of-process COM object using `IRemUnknown2` and the object is marshaled using the Aggregate Standard Marshaler, which uses RQI2.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Type confusion: The local proxy object is created for the IID in the OBJREF stream, not the IID requested in RQI2.
  - Lack of verification: No verification occurs after unmarshaling the interface, leading to the incorrect proxy being used by the caller.
  - Abuse of OLE Automation auto-proxy creation: If a type library is associated with an interface, OLEAUT32 is used to create a proxy, and the type library is loaded based on its GUID. If this fails, the filename is passed to LoadTypeLib, which can also parse monikers.

- Impact of exploitation:
  - Privilege escalation: By exploiting the type confusion and redirecting the type library loading to a malicious scriptlet moniker, arbitrary code can be executed within a privileged COM caller's context (e.g., BITS service).
  - The exploit allows for a local privilege escalation from a lower-privileged user to SYSTEM by getting a privileged service to load and execute arbitrary code through a type library.

- Attack vectors:
  - Local: The attacker must be able to control an out-of-process COM object that is marshaled using the Aggregate Standard Marshaler. This object must have a custom marshaled interface.
  - The attacker must then cause a more privileged user or service (such as a sandbox broker or service) to query the custom marshaled interface for a different interface that's automation compatible.
  - The vulnerability is triggered via the `QueryInterface` method on an object.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to control a COM object that is marshaled using the Aggregate Standard Marshaler with a custom marshaled interface.
  - Ability to trigger a more privileged COM object to call QueryInterface on the attacker-controlled COM object with an interface that is automation compatible, preferably while impersonating the caller.
  - The attacker needs to be able to control the returned OBJREF to cause a type confusion. The PoC specifically targets the BITS service.
  - The ability to write files to the file system, create symlinks, and create a type library file that references a scriptlet moniker.
