Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `libmpeg2` library, which is used for decoding MPEG-2 video streams.
- Specifically, there was an issue related to the handling of co-efficients where the coefficient index could exceed the allowed number.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is a critical vulnerability that allows for the execution of arbitrary code.
- Improper bounds checking during the processing of co-efficients in MPEG-2 video streams

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This means the attacker could gain control of the device, install malware, steal data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted MPEG-2 video file.
- The attacker can deliver the crafted file through various methods (e.g., via a website, email attachment, or malicious app).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to get the crafted video file onto the target device (e.g., by luring the user to open it, embedding it within an app, or utilizing other vulnerabilities for delivery)
- No special position on the network is explicitly required. It is a remote exploit.
- No user interaction is mentioned, meaning it could be triggered without user awareness

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with the commit [d5f52646974c29e6b7d51230b8ddae0c0a9430dc](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libmpeg2/%2B/d5f52646974c29e6b7d51230b8ddae0c0a9430dc).
- The issue was present in Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, and 7.1.2.
