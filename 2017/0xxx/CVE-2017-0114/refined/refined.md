The provided content relates to CVE-2017-0114, as it is listed within the multiple CVEs associated with the described vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the way Windows Uniscribe processes font files. Specifically, malformed font files or specific API calls against them lead to crashes due to invalid memory read accesses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple heap out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities and wild reads are present in the Uniscribe font processing library. The issues are triggered by corrupted font files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact of exploitation is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The crashes occur during font processing, potentially leading to application termination or system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted, malformed font file to an application using Windows Uniscribe. This can be done through various means, such as opening a document containing a malicious font, or displaying text using such a font.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted font file to the targeted system. They would need to induce the system to process this font through a vulnerable application, or by using a Uniscribe-specific API function.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided source links to a Google Project Zero issue tracker describing the discovery process through fuzzing.
- The vulnerability affects the `USP10.dll` module which is responsible for text layout and rendering.
- The identified crashes occur in various functions of the module including `otlMultiSubstLookup::apply`, `otlSingleSubstLookup::applyToSingleGlyph`, `otlMark2Array::mark2Anchor` and `BuildTableCache`, amongst others.
- PageHeap should be enabled for reliable reproductions.
- The vulnerability was tested and reproduces successfully on Windows 7.
