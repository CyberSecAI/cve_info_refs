Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0724:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `libmpeg2` library, specifically in how it handles frame width and height. The code does not properly check if parsed width/height values are valid before using them. If the width or height is parsed as zero, it causes an issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The code does not validate the width/height parameters, leading to a potential division by zero or other invalid operation when processing a crafted media file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit can lead to a crash or hang of the media processing service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Media File: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted media file, likely an MPEG2 video, where the frame dimensions are set to zero. The vulnerable application or service would parse these dimensions and trigger the error when processing them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable device with a malicious media file. This could occur through various means, including:
  - Sending the file through a messaging application.
  - Hosting the file on a malicious website and enticing a user to visit it.
  - Including the file in a malicious application

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability is described in the Android Security Bulletin for August 2017.
- The issue is addressed in the AOSP commit `08a0d1ab6277770babbedab6ce7e7e2481869ad0`.
- This vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, and 7.1.2.
