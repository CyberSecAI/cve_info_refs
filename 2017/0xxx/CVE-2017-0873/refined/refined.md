Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0873:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a potential infinite loop in the decoder when an error is encountered after the bitstream buffer has been exhausted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The decoder can enter an infinite loop if an error occurs after the bitstream buffer has been exhausted, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** The decoder lacked a proper check to handle the specific error condition, leading to the infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The infinite loop will cause the affected device to become unresponsive as the decoder consumes resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media File:** A specially crafted media file containing a specific error after the bitstream buffer has been exhausted can trigger the infinite loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide the crafted media file:** An attacker needs to provide the device with a media file that includes the specific error case to trigger the vulnerability. This could be through various methods such as MMS, webpage, or locally through a malicious application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check to prevent the decoder from entering an infinite loop when the bitstream buffer is exhausted and an error occurs.
- The provided commit messages indicate that this vulnerability is present in `libmpeg2`.
- The CVE is classified as a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.
