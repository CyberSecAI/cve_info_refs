Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-0059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) condition that occurs when manipulating the `defaultValue` property of a `<textarea>` element in Internet Explorer 11. Specifically, when a form is reset, and then the `defaultValue` of the `<textarea>` is accessed in an event handler, the underlying text value is freed, but the pointer is still used, leading to the UAF. This UAF is due to text allocations not being protected by MemGC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability on the textarea's text value. The text value is freed when the form is reset, but a reference to it is still held by the event handler.
- **Memory Disclosure:**  The use-after-free can be leveraged to leak information from freed memory.  The content of this freed memory could be sensitive information from other parts of the application.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This vulnerability can also lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in combination with other techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Information Leak:** Sensitive information can be leaked from freed memory, which can then be used in subsequent attacks.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the use-after-free and controlling memory, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML page that contains a `<textarea>` element, an iframe, a form and the Javascript code to trigger the UAF.
- The user must load this malicious HTML page in Internet Explorer 11 for the exploit to work.
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by setting the `defaultValue` of the text area after a form reset, inside an event handler that is triggered after the iframe content has loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML file or inject malicious code into a website visited by the victim.
- The attacker does not need any special access or privileges on the victim's machine other than a web browser and internet connection.
- The attacker must get the victim to visit the malicious HTML page in Internet Explorer.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the use of Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) chains to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP).
- The exploits also use heap spraying to improve reliability and gain control of program execution.
- Different versions of the exploit target different versions of Windows/IE, requiring different offsets, gadgets and techniques.
- The exploit utilizes a technique that leaks the base address of a module in memory which is required to construct the ROP chain.
