Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0594:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in `SoftAACEncoder2::onQueueFilled()`. The original code blindly copied header information into a user-supplied buffer without verifying if the buffer had sufficient space. Although the code later checks for sufficient space when filling the data, the header copy operation was unchecked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. Because the header is copied without checking the buffer size, an attacker can cause a write past the end of the user-supplied buffer by providing an undersized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability because an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The Mediaserver process runs with higher privileges, meaning successful exploitation can potentially give an attacker control over the media subsystem.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector is a local malicious application that interacts with the vulnerable `SoftAACEncoder2`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Application Execution:** An attacker needs the ability to run a malicious application on the target Android device.
- **Ability to Interact with Mediaserver:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with Mediaserver to leverage `SoftAACEncoder2`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code diffs from android.googlesource.com show the fix for this vulnerability. It adds a bounds check before the header is copied to the user-supplied buffer.
*   The vulnerability was reported on Jan 22, 2017, according to the May 2017 Android Security Bulletin.
*   The Android Security Bulletin indicates that this issue is rated as High severity.
