Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-0247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from ASP.NET Core's failure to properly validate web requests.
*   Specifically, the `TextEncoder.EncodeCore` function in the `System.Text.Encodings.Web` package does not correctly calculate the length of 4-byte characters in the Unicode Non-Character range.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is that the web request validation in ASP.NET Core was insufficient, specifically in how it handled certain Unicode characters during encoding. This lack of proper validation allows for maliciously crafted requests to bypass checks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition, where an attacker can cause the application to become unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted web requests containing specific Unicode characters, attackers can cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a DoS. The application will become unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, which makes it easier to exploit.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects specific versions of several packages, including:
    *   `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and related packages
    *   `System.Text.Encodings.Web`
    *   `System.Net.Http`
    *   `System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler`
    *   `System.Net.Security`
    *    `System.Net.WebSockets.Client`
*   The vulnerability is fixed in the updated versions of these packages, which includes `1.0.4` and `1.1.3` for ASP.NET Core MVC packages.
*   The vulnerability was reported by David Fernandez of Sidertia Solutions.
