# Microsoft Security Advisory 4021279: Vulnerabilities in .NET Core, ASP.NET Core Could Allow Elevation of Privilege

## Executive Summary

Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about vulnerabilities in public .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.

.NET Core & ASP.NET Core are the next generation of .NET that provide a familiar and modern framework for web and cloud scenarios. These products are actively developed by the .NET and ASP.NET team in collaboration with a community of open source developers, running on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. When .NET Core was released, the version number was reset to 1.0.0 to reflect the fact that it is a separate product from its predecessor -.NET.

## Discussion

To discuss the ASP.NET Core issues please see <https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/6246>

To discuss the CoreFX Core issues please see <https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/19535>

## Advisory FAQ

### How do I know if I am affected?

.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. If your project has a direct or transitive dependency on any of the packages and versions listed above, you are affected.

Note: As part of patching ASP.NET Core MVC we update every Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.\* package. If, for example, you have a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` you should update to the appropriate version first (1.0.x should be updated to 1.0.4, 1.1.x should be updated to 1.1.3), and it will also update any other vulnerable  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` dependency.

### NET Core Project formats

.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.

1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.
2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

You must ensure you follow the correct update instructions for your project type.

### Direct Dependencies

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.

Direct dependencies are discoverable by reviewing your `project.json` or `csproj` file.

### Transitive Dependencies

Transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.

Transitive dependencies are reviewable in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching, or by reviewing the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` projects or the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` projects. These files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.

## How do I fix my affected application?

You will need to fix both direct dependencies and review and fix any transitive dependencies. The affected packages and versions in the previous “Affected Software” section include each vulnerable package, the vulnerable versions, and the patched versions

---

**Note**: If you are using ASP.NET Core MVC in your projects you should first update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` version according to the affected versions table above. If you are currently using version 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 or 1.0.3 you should update your package version to 1.0.4. If you are using version 1.1.0, 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 you should update your package version to 1.1.3. This will update every MVC package to the fixed versions.

---

### Fixing Direct Dependencies – project.json/VS2015

Open your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:

```
    "dependencies": {
      "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
        "version": "1.0.1",
        "type": "platform"
      },
     "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "1.0.1",
     "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc ": "1.0.1",
    }
```

This example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.

`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.

Review your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` version 1.0.1.

To update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` to 1.0.4.

After updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.

The dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:

```
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "type": "platform"
    },
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "1.0.1",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc": "1.0.4",
  }
```

If you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.

If you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.

After you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.

### Fixing Direct Dependencies – csproj/VS2017

Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore" Version="1.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc" Version="1.1.2" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="1.0.0 " />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

The example has two direct package dependencies, as seen by the two `PackageReference` elements. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name. The example shows two packages `Microsoft.AspNetCore` version 1.1.1, and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.

Review your `PackageReference` elements for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` version 1.1.2.

To update to the fixed package, change the version number to the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` to 1.1.3.

After updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore" Version="1.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core" Version="1.1.3" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="1.0.0 " />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

If you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.

If you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.

### After updating your direct dependencies

Recompile your application.

If after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to the appropriate version.

For example if your project refers to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing` with a version number of 1.0.1 when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 1.0.4, compilation will throw:

`NU1012 Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core 1.0.4 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing >= 1.0.4 but received 1.0.1`

To fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your `csproj` or `project.json` in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.

After you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.

### Reviewing Transitive Dependencies

There are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review your `project.lock.json` (project.json/VS2015) or `project.assets.json` (csproj/VS2017) file.

#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2015)

If you want to use Visual Studio 2015, open your project in Visual Studio 2015 and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.

For example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2015.

[![vs2015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858059/a1ae6624-348f-11e7-9ce9-ff2d25a3fc5b.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858059/a1ae6624-348f-11e7-9ce9-ff2d25a3fc5b.png)

The search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, version 1.0.1, ` vulnerable version.

The first entry under the References heading refers to the target framework your application is using. This will be `.NETCoreApp`, `.NETStandard` or `.NET-Framework-vX.Y.Z` (where X.Y.Z is an actual version number) depending on how you configured your application. Under your target framework will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on. In this example, the application takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In this case the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and numerous other packages.

#### Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)

Open the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.

If you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.

[![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)

Search the `project.lock.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `AssemblyName/`. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`. If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.

#### Fixing transitive dependencies (project.json/VS2015)

If you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.

If your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:

```
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "type": "platform"
    },
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "1.1.0",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc": "1.1.0"
  }
```

For each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `System.Net.Security` version 4.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 4.0.1. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:

```
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "type": "platform"
    },
    "System.Net.Security": "4.0.1",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "1.1.0",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc": "1.1.1"
  }
```

After you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.

If you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.

If you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.

#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2017)

If you want to use Solution Explorer, open your project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.

For example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017.

[![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)

The search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.

Under the Dependencies node will be a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer` which in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.

#### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)

Open the `project.assets.json` file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.

Search the `project.assets.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `AssemblyName/`. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`. If your `project.assets.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.

If you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.

If your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `csproj` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click on the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose Edit `projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where `projectname` is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore" Version="1.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc" Version="1.1.3" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="1.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

For each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `csproj` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `System.Net.Security` version 4.3.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 4.3.1.

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="System.Net.Security" Version="4.3.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore" Version="1.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc" Version="1.1.3" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="1.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

After you have added the direct dependency reference, save your `csproj` file.

If you are using Visual Studio, save your updated `csproj` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.

If you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.

### Rebuilding your application

Finally rebuild your application, test as you would do normally and redeploy using your favored deployment mechanism.

## Description

A denial of service vulnerability exists when the ASP.NET Core fails to properly validate web requests. NOTE: Microsoft has not commented on third-party claims that the issue is that the TextEncoder.EncodeCore function in the System.Text.Encodings.Web package in ASP.NET Core Mvc before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by leveraging failure to properly calculate the length of 4-byte characters in the Unicode Non-Character range.
