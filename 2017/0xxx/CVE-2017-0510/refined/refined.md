  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-0510",
      "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel FIQ debugger could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the kernel FIQ debugger, which is accessible through the headphone jack's UART interface.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control to the FIQ debugger",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization when handling commands",
        "Ability to access the FIQ debugger even after platform is loaded"
      ],
      "impact": "A local malicious application can achieve a permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the OS to repair the device. Attackers can gain access to the kernel, leak stack canaries, bypass ASLR, trigger factory resets and communicate with internal SoCs.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Physical access to the device via malicious headphones or modified audio cables using the exposed UART interface on the headphone jack"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to craft and send commands through the UART interface",
          "Physical access to the targeted device",
         "Knowledge of the FIQ debugger’s command format"
      ],
         "additional_details": [
        "The FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request) debugger module is implemented mainly by `fiq_debugger.c` and `tegra_fiq_debugger.c` in the tegra kernel tree.",
        "The FIQ debugger allows an attacker to dump registers, call stack, kernel logs, process list, and even interact with `HBOOT` (bootloader) using a custom command ('reboot oem-42').",
        "An attacker can potentially leak stack canaries due to the ability to dump register state",
          "An attacker can derandomize ASLR and map addresses of loaded shared libraries",
        "The device can be forced to `HBOOT` mode by issuing a specific reboot command (reboot oem-42), and can be forced to factory reset via a different command (reboot oem-76).",
        "The `HBOOT` interface allows interaction with I²C buses and attached System-on-Chips (SoCs).",
          "The patch for this issue limits functionality of the FIQ debugger and prevents reboots to HBOOT when the platform is up. It does so by disabling register dumping, and OEM reboot commands (reboot oem-*).",
        "Prior to the patch, the vulnerability could be exploited during the kernel bootup window as well."
