Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0720:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-0720

**Description:** A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Android media framework, specifically within the `libhevc` library.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `libhevc` library, which handles HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) video decoding.
- The commit message "Handle error return in parse slice" suggests the issue lies within the parsing of HEVC video slices.
- The commit "Adding Error Check For PictureStructure Param" indicates that the parsing of picture structures might lead to the vulnerability.
- The issue arises when invalid or maliciously crafted picture structure parameters are processed by the decoder, which leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is RCE.
- **Memory Corruption:** The invalid picture structure parsing leads to memory corruption within the decoder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, meaning the attacker could gain significant control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted File:** The attack requires a specially crafted file that contains malicious HEVC data.
- **Remote:** The attacker can initiate the attack remotely by delivering the crafted file through channels like websites, email, or messaging apps.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be physically present or have prior access to the device.
- **Crafted HEVC Data:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid-looking HEVC file with maliciously crafted parameters to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, and 7.1.2.
- The fix involves adding error checks to validate the picture structure data before processing it.
- The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for remote code execution within a privileged process.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-0720 describes a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the `libhevc` library. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HEVC file to the device, leading to memory corruption and potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with high privileges.
