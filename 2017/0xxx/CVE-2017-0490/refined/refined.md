  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-0490",
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Wi-Fi could enable a local malicious application to delete user data. This issue is rated as Moderate because it is a local bypass of user interaction requirements that would normally require either user initiation or user permission.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from how the Wi-Fi installation file was being deleted. Previously, the parsing function `WifiManager#buildWifiConfig` was responsible for deleting the installation file after processing. This exposed a security vulnerability because a caller could use this function to delete arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper file handling",
      "Elevation of Privilege",
       "Local privilege escalation",
        "Bypass of user interaction requirements"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files, leading to data loss.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "local_malicious_app": "A local malicious app could call the parsing function `WifiManager#buildWifiConfig` to delete arbitrary files.",
      "local_access": "The attacker needs local access to the device."
    },
    "required_capabilities": "A local malicious application with the ability to interact with the vulnerable parsing function `WifiManager#buildWifiConfig`."
  },
  "resolution": "The underlying API used by `WifiManager#buildWifiConfig` was updated to not perform file deletion. The responsibility for deleting the installation file was moved to the caller of the API, ensuring that the deletion is done at the right level."
