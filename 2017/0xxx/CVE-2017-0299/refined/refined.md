{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nt!NtNotifyChangeDirectoryFile` system call discloses portions of uninitialized pool memory to user-mode clients due to output structure alignment holes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory disclosure",
    "Uninitialized memory usage",
     "Alignment issues"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local authenticated attackers could defeat certain exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
  "Attack vectors": "By making a `NtNotifyChangeDirectoryFile` system call and observing the output data, an attacker can read uninitialized kernel memory. Specifically, triggering filesystem operations that return multiple `FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION` structures, particularly when filename strings have an odd length, exposes the uninitialized bytes located in the alignment hole between these structures.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local authenticated access."
