Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0835:

**CVE-2017-0835:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an error handling issue in the `impeg2d_pre_pic_dec_proc` function within the libmpeg2 library. Specifically, if this function returns an error, the decoder doesn't stop trying to decode, leading to potential issues.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is improper error propagation. Instead of halting upon encountering an error in `impeg2d_pre_pic_dec_proc`, the decoding process continues. This can lead to further issues, such as memory corruption or out-of-bounds access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted media file. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process, potentially gaining control of the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted media file being processed by the vulnerable media framework component (libmpeg2).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious MPEG-2 file to a vulnerable device. This could happen through various means such as malicious websites, compromised messaging apps, or other channels that process media content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided commit messages from `android.googlesource.com` confirm that the vulnerability was related to error handling during the decoding of MPEG-2 media, and a check was added to ensure the decoder stops in the case of errors, preventing the continuation of the decoding process when it should not.
*   The Android Security Bulletin confirms the CVE is a critical RCE and affects Android versions 5.0.2 through 8.0.
*   The fix involved changes to the `libmpeg2` library, specifically within the AOSP repository.

**Summary**

CVE-2017-0835 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability that resides in the Android Media framework's libmpeg2 library. By exploiting this vulnerability with a malformed MPEG-2 file, an attacker could gain arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process. The provided information gives details on the root cause, impact, attack vector and also the fix for this vulnerability.
