{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an issue in the libmpeg2 library where the number of bytes consumed in a multi-threaded run was zero, leading the decoder to run in an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop due to incorrect byte consumption in multi-threaded run."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to the infinite loop. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and instability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted media file could trigger the vulnerable code."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MPEG2 file to the media framework to trigger the vulnerability."
