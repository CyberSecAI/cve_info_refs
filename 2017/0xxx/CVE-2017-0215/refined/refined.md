The provided content is related to CVE-2017-0215.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `PSWorkFlowUtility` PowerShell module, which contains an embedded Authenticode signature and allows the execution of arbitrary unsigned PowerShell code via the `Invoke-Expression` cmdlet. This is because the module accepts a string as a parameter and executes it as PowerShell code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `PSWorkFlowUtility` module was signed by Microsoft and therefore, was permitted to execute in Full Language Mode, even within a Device Guard environment that restricts unsigned code.
- The module takes a string as input and executes it as PowerShell code via `Invoke-Expression`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass User Mode Code Integrity (UMCI) restrictions and execute arbitrary, unsigned PowerShell code in Full Language Mode.
- Attackers can use the vulnerable module to execute malicious code, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can import the vulnerable `PSWorkFlowUtility` module (including the old version) and use the `-Expression` parameter to pass arbitrary PowerShell code for execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute PowerShell code on the target system.
- The attacker also needs to obtain the old, vulnerable version of `PSWorkFlowUtility` which is portable due to the embedded Authenticode signature.
