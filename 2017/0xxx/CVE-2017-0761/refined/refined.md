Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0761:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-0761

**Description:** The Android Security Bulletin of September 2017 lists CVE-2017-0761 as a critical severity vulnerability within the Media Framework, specifically in `libavc`.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a result of an integer overflow in reference list creation within the `libavc` library. Specifically, the code uses a `long` variable to store a list index which has a maximum value of 255 but the loop control variable was not wide enough to prevent an overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The code uses a 32-bit variable to control the loop, while a long variable with only a maximum value of 255 is used as a list index. This discrepancy allows an attacker to trigger an integer overflow when creating the reference list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.
- The crafted file is processed by the `libavc` library, which leads to the integer overflow and subsequent arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to deliver a specially crafted media file to the targeted Android device.
- No specific user interaction is mentioned beyond processing of the malformed file by the media framework.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with the provided commit link to the fix: `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libavc/%2B/ce512058186120a0de2916f6e22be58455df1a49`

- The patch implements a 32-bit variable to prevent an overflow.

- Affected Android versions: 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0.
