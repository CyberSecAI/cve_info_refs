Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of invalid chroma to size values, specifically in the `libhevc` library. This issue arises during the parsing of media data where incorrect TU sizes for chroma are signaled due to parsing errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Chroma Handling:** The code does not properly validate chroma to size values, leading to a potential crash when invalid values are encountered during media processing. This is due to an issue with the function index (`func_idx`).
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code doesn't limit the function index to a valid range. When a wrong TU size is signaled for chroma due to parsing error, the code calls an invalid function resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The CVE description states that this is a Critical vulnerability which could lead to remote code execution by using a specially crafted file to cause memory corruption during media processing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Media Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious media file that contains invalid chroma to size parameters.
- **Media Processing:** When the vulnerable code processes this malicious file, it leads to memory corruption and potentially remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Media Files:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted media file to a device using the vulnerable `libhevc` library. This could happen via methods such as email, web browsing, or MMS.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit message indicates that a fix has been implemented to limit `func_idx` to valid range to ensure invalid functions are not called when the wrong TU size is signaled for chroma due to error in parsing.

This information is more detailed than a basic CVE description, as it provides the specific location and nature of the error, along with the mechanism used for exploitation.
