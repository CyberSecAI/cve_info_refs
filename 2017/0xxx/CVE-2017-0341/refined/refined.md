- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver has a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for `DxgDdiEscape`, where user-provided input can trigger an access to a pointer that has not been initialized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Access to an uninitialized pointer
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service or potential escalation of privileges
- **Attack vectors:** User-provided input through the `DxgDdiEscape` handler in the kernel mode driver
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access with low privileges.
