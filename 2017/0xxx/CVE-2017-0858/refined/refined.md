Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect variable data types within the `ih264d_get_implicit_weights` function. Specifically, the difference between two 32-bit signed numbers was being assigned to a 16-bit variable. This truncation led to a potential division-by-zero arithmetic exception during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Data Type Handling:** Assigning the result of a 32-bit subtraction to a smaller 16-bit variable is causing data truncation, which can lead to an arithmetic error.
*   **Division by Zero:** The data truncation could result in a zero value, leading to a division by zero error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The division-by-zero exception can cause the application or device processing the malformed H.264 stream to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed H.264 Video Stream:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specifically crafted or malformed H.264 video stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed H.264 video stream to a device or application that uses the vulnerable libavc library. This could occur through various means, such as:
    *   Playing the video locally from a file.
    *   Streaming the video over a network.
    *   Embedding the video in a malicious website or app.
    *   Sending the video via messaging applications.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes the code change that fixes the issue, which involves modifying variable names to match their data types to avoid the truncation.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0.
* The severity is classified as NSI which is not defined and should be a High severity.
* The vulnerability is present in the `libavc` component, specifically during implicit weight calculations in H.264 video decoding.
