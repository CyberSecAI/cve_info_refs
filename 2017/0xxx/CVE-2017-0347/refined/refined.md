- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` does not properly validate a value passed from a user, which is then used as an index to an array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation, specifically lack of validation on a user-provided value used as an array index.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a call to the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler in the kernel mode layer, with a user-controlled value being passed as an array index.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver through the `DxgkDdiEscape` interface with an ability to pass arbitrary values.
