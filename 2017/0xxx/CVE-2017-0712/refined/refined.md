{
  "CVE-2017-0712": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient check of `params.num_ap` against `MAX_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_APS` when processing a Wi-Fi significant change.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "A stack overflow vulnerability exists due to missing bounds check"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local malicious application could cause a stack overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application can send a crafted message that does not respect the maximum number of APs for tracking significant Wi-Fi changes, triggering the overflow.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires the ability to install and run a malicious application on the device."
  }
