```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The soft_avc encoder cached buffer sizes across a point where the size could be reset by an app, allowing crafted requests to hit outside of the current buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code by writing outside of the allocated buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "An app could craft a request to the soft_avc encoder to trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to execute code on the device, likely as a malicious application."
