{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Package Installer had a vulnerability that allowed a malicious application to bypass the intended restrictions on intent handling. Specifically, package installer intents should always be handled by the package installer, but privileged apps could set a priority greater than 0, which would cause the intent to be handled by that app instead.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect intent handling",
      "Lack of proper privilege check"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious app could prevent users from uninstalling other applications or removing permissions of existing apps.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have an application installed on the device with a higher priority for handling package install intents (i.e., a privileged app).",
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Package Manager could enable a local malicious application to prevent users from uninstalling applications or removing permissions from applications. This issue is rated as Moderate because it is a local bypass of user interaction requirements."
