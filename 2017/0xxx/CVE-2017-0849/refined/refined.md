Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-0849:

**CVE-2017-0849**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing out-of-bounds check on `u4_num_bufs` within the input arguments of `ps_dec_ip->s_out_buffer` in the `libavc` library. This lack of validation allows for an attacker to potentially provide an invalid value, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the `u4_num_bufs` parameter, allowing it to exceed expected bounds.
    *   **Out-of-bounds access:** Without proper input validation, the code might access memory beyond allocated buffer.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The CVE description classifies this as an information disclosure vulnerability. While the exact nature of the disclosure is not specified, it typically implies that an attacker can read sensitive data from the system's memory. However the root cause suggests memory corruption.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted media file containing a malformed value for the `u4_num_bufs` parameter, leading to the out of bounds access when processed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted media file to a vulnerable system. This could involve using malicious apps or delivering the file through another vulnerable service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code commit `aa11ab9fdbb63766703a6280f4fc778f2f2c91ed` from android.googlesource.com shows the fix for the out of bounds check.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Android (6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0), as shown in the bulletin, this indicates the issue is not platform specific but exists in the vulnerable code library.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate" in the security bulletin.
