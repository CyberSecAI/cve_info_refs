Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-0570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Broadcom Wi-Fi driver. This vulnerability is due to an unspecified flaw within the driver's code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A local malicious application could exploit the flaw in the Broadcom Wi-Fi driver to gain elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This can lead to a compromise of the system's security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector involves a malicious application installed on the device. This application would need to interact with the vulnerable Broadcom Wi-Fi driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the targeted device, implying a certain degree of access.
*   **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of the specific vulnerability in the Broadcom Wi-Fi driver to craft an exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as High severity because, while it requires a local application to execute, it allows for arbitrary code execution within the kernel, posing a significant threat.
*   The patch for this issue is not publicly available, and is contained in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the Google Developer site.
*   The vulnerability affects the Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Pixel C, and Nexus Player devices.
