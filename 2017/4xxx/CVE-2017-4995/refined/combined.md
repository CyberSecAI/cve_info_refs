# CVE-2017-4995: Jackson Configuration Allows Code Execution with Unknown “Serialization Gadgets”

LOW | JUNE 08, 2017 | CVE-2017-4995
# Description

When configured to enable default typing, Jackson contained a [deserialization vulnerability](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1599) that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Jackson fixed this vulnerability by blacklisting known "deserialization gadgets".

Spring Security configures Jackson with [global default typing](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization#11-global-default-typing) enabled which means that through the previous exploit, arbitrary code could be executed if all of the following is true:

* Spring Security’s Jackson support is being leveraged by invoking SecurityJackson2Modules.getModules(ClassLoader) or SecurityJackson2Modules.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper)
* Jackson is used to deserialize data that is not trusted. Spring Security does not perform deserialization using Jackson, so this is an explicit choice of the user.
* There is an unknown (Jackson is not blacklisting it already) “deserialization gadget” that allows code execution present on the classpath

Jackson provides a blacklisting approach to protecting against this type of attack, but Spring Security should be proactive against blocking unknown “deserialization gadgets” when Spring Security enables default typing.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Security 4.2.0.RELEASE - 4.2.2.RELEASE
* Spring Security 5.0.0.M1

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* Releases that have fixed this issue include:
  + Spring Security: 4.2.3.RELEASE+
  + Spring Security: 5.0.0.M2+
* The fix ensures that by default only explicitly mapped classes will be deserialized. The effect of using explicitly mapped classes is to create a whitelist which works with all supported versions of Jackson. If users explicitly opt into [global default typing](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization#11-global-default-typing), the previous potentially dangerous configuration is restored.
