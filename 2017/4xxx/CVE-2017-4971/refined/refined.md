Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-4971:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Spring Web Flow handles data binding in view states, specifically when the `useSpringBinding` property of the `MvcViewFactoryCreator` is left at its default value (false), and no explicit data binding property mappings are defined using the `<sub-element>`. In this configuration, malicious EL (Expression Language) expressions within form submissions can be used to bind data to unintended fields on the target object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unintentional Data Binding:**  Without explicit data binding configurations, user-supplied input (form data) can potentially modify any field of the target object, not just those intended by the application developer.
- **Expression Language Injection:** Malicious users can inject EL expressions into form parameters, which the application will then process, leading to unintended code execution or data manipulation, through binding to an arbitrary field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By using carefully crafted EL expressions, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify sensitive data by binding form fields to unexpected object properties.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Form Submissions:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious form data containing crafted EL expressions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit form data to the vulnerable web application. This typically requires being able to interact with the application over the network, usually through a web browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Spring Web Flow versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and older unsupported versions.
- Spring Web Flow applications using JSF (JavaServer Faces) are not affected by this vulnerability.
- The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to Spring Web Flow version 2.4.5.
- It is also strongly recommended to explicitly define data binding declarations in view states using the `<sub-element>` to prevent unintended data binding, even after upgrading.
