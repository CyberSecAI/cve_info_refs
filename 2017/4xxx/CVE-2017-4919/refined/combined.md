#### Issue/Introduction

The VIX API VM Direct Access Function could be used by vSphere users with limited privileges to interact directly with a Guest Operating System (Guest OS). This issue is documented in [VMSA-2017-0012](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2017-0012.html) and tracked by [CVE-2017-4919](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-4919).

 This KB provides details on the privileges that vSphere users with limited privileges would need to use this function. It also provides workarounds that prevent vSphere users with limited privileges from using this function.

#### Resolution

For details on vSphere permissions and user management,see [vSphere Permissions and User Management Tasks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-5372F580-5C23-4E9C-8A4E-EF1B4DD9033E.html) section in the VMware vSphere Guide.

**To determine that the** **VIX API VM Direct Access Function can be used by a limited vSphere user.**

 The VIX API VM Direct Access Function may be used by vSphere users with limited privileges if **all** of the following three privileges have been set:

* Virtual Machine > Configuration > Advanced
  AND
* Virtual Machine > Interaction > Guest Operating System Management by VIX API
  AND
* Host > Configuration > Advanced Settings

For a list of vSphere privileges, see [Defined Privileges](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-ED56F3C4-77D0-49E3-88B6-B99B8B437B62.html) section in the VMware vSphere Guide.
 **Note**:The latter setting is host-wide.The first two settings are specific to the vSphere user.

**To remove the capability to use the VIX API VM Direct Access Function by vSphere users with limited privileges.**

These three workarounds remove the capability to use the VIX API VM Direct Access Function by vSphere users with limited privileges. Each workaround is sufficient by itself.

* **vSphere user privileges workaround**

  The preferred workaround is to remove the following configuration setting from the vSphere users with limited privileges:

   **Virtual Machine** > **Interaction** > **Guest Operating System Management by VIX API**
* **VMware Tools workaround I**

  For virtual machines that run on ESXi 6.0 and above and that run VMware Tools between version 9.10.0 (inclusive) and 10.0.x: disable VIX API VM Direct Access Function by adding the following lines to the guest-specific configuration file tools.conf:

  [guestoperations]
  Authentication.InfrastructureAgents.disabled=true

  Notes:

+ This workaround is not relevant for virtual machines that run on ESXi 5.5.
+ This workaround should not be used in case:

- VMware Site Recovery Manager is used
- VMware Update Manager is used to update Virtual Appliances
- VMware Infrastructure Navigator is used.

 For more information on how the tools.conf file is edited and where it is located, see  [Enabling debug logging for VMware Tools within a guest operating system (1007873)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1007873)

* **VMware Tools workaround II**

  For virtual machines that run on ESXi 6.0 and above: Update to VMware Tools version 10.1.0 or above. The VIX API VM Direct Access function is disabled starting in VMware Tools version 10.1.0.

  **Notes**:

+ This workaround is not relevant for virtual machines that run on ESXi 5.5.
+ Some older VMware products are incompatible with newer VMware Tools, see *known issues* in the [VMware Tools 10.1.0 release notes](http://pubs.vmware.com/Release_Notes/en/vmwaretools/1010/vmware-tools-1010-release-notes.html#knownissues).

#####

##### 1. Summary

VMware VIX API allows for direct access to Guest Operating Systems (Guest OSs) by vSphere users with limited privileges.

#####

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware vCenter Server

#####

##### 3. Problem Description

**VMware VIX API VM Direct Access Function security issue**

The VMware VIX API has a functionality that allows for direct access to Guests OSs which is used by VMware Site Recovery Manager, VMware Update Manager, and VMware Infrastructure Navigator to manage Guest OSs. This functionality may be used by vSphere users with limited privileges to access a Guest OS without the need to authenticate.

In order for vSphere users with limited privileges to use this functionality, they would need to have all three of the following privileges:

Virtual Machine -> Configuration -> Advanced

Virtual Machine -> Interaction ->

Guest Operating System Management by VIX API

Host -> Configuration -> Advanced Settings

**Workaround**

Workarounds that remove the direct access to Guest OSs by vSphere users with limited privileges are listed in VMware Knowledge Base article **2151027**.

These workarounds are not relevant for vSphere users that are fully privileged. Typically they already have alternate ways to access Guest OSs.

VMware would like to thank Ofri Ziv and Itamar Tal of Guardicore for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2017-4919 to this issue.
