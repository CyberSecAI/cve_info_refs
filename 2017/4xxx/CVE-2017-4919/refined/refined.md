Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-4919:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The VMware VIX API has a function that allows for direct access to Guest Operating Systems (Guest OSs). This functionality, intended for use by VMware Site Recovery Manager, VMware Update Manager, and VMware Infrastructure Navigator, can be misused by vSphere users with limited privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Privilege Checks:** The VIX API VM Direct Access function does not properly restrict access based on user privileges. It allows users with limited privileges to interact directly with a Guest OS if specific privileges are granted.
- **Direct Guest OS Access:** The vulnerability allows direct access to the Guest OS, bypassing the usual authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Guest OS:** A vSphere user with limited privileges can gain direct access to a Guest OS without needing to authenticate within the guest OS.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** Once inside the Guest OS, the attacker could potentially perform any actions permitted by the guest OS account they have access to. This could include data exfiltration, system modification, or malware installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **VIX API:** Attackers use the VIX API VM Direct Access function.
- **Privilege Escalation via Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability is exploited through a combination of specific vSphere privileges assigned to a user with limited access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **vSphere User Account:** The attacker needs a vSphere user account, even one with limited privileges.
- **Specific vSphere Permissions:** The attacker must have the following three privileges set in vSphere:
   - `Virtual Machine > Configuration > Advanced`
   - `Virtual Machine > Interaction > Guest Operating System Management by VIX API`
   - `Host > Configuration > Advanced Settings`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not relevant for fully privileged vSphere users.
- Workarounds are available, involving the revocation of `Guest Operating System Management by VIX API` privilege, disabling the functionality by editing the `tools.conf` in Guest OS, or upgrading to VMware Tools 10.1.0 or above.
- The vulnerability affects VMware vCenter Server versions 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5.
