The provided content is related to CVE-2017-4911.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read/write issue in the JPEG2000 parser within the TPView.dll component of VMware Workstation and Horizon View Client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read/write in JPEG2000 parser in TPView.dll

**Impact of exploitation:**
- On VMware Workstation, a guest operating system could execute code or perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the host Windows OS running Workstation.
- On Horizon View Client, a View desktop could execute code or perform a DoS on the Windows OS running the Horizon View Client.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing is enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but is enabled by default on Horizon View.
- The vulnerability resides in the parsing of JPEG2000 images, which would likely be triggered by a malicious or crafted image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger the parsing of a crafted JPEG2000 image via the virtual printing mechanism. On Workstation, this would involve having control of a guest OS; on Horizon View, this would involve control of the remote desktop.
