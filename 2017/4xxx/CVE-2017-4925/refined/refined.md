- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in guest RPC request handling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A NULL pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers with normal user privileges to crash their virtual machines.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending malicious guest RPC requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Normal user privileges within the guest VM are required.
