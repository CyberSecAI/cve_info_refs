The provided content is related to CVE-2017-4946.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of process handles by the VMware Horizon (V4H/V4PA) desktop agent. Specifically, the unprivileged process `vmwagent.exe` possessed a handle to the privileged parent process `v4pa_agent.exe`, which runs under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, with excessive access rights.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Privileged Process Handle Exposure:** An unprivileged process (`vmwagent.exe`) had an open handle to a privileged process (`v4pa_agent.exe`).
- **Excessive Handle Rights:** The handle held by the unprivileged process had rights that allowed it to interact with the privileged process, including memory allocation and modification (e.g., VirtualAllocEx, VirtualProtectEx).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with developer access to a VDI session can exploit this vulnerability to gain local administrative privileges on all Windows desktops within the VDI environment.
- **Code Execution Under System Context:** By manipulating the privileged process, an attacker can achieve code execution within the security context of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- **Full Control over Desktops:** Once the attacker has system privileges they can install malware, change configurations, and access sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Process Handle Manipulation:** The attacker leverages the exposed privileged handle to interact with the parent process.
- **Code Injection:** Using the exposed handle, an attacker injects malicious code or modifies the execution flow of the privileged process.
- **Hooking:** The attacker hooks a common library function (`RtlInitUnicodeString`) in the parent process to redirect execution to malicious shellcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Developer Access:** The attacker needs to have developer access to a VDI session.
- **No Local Admin Rights:** The attacker starts without local administrative access, highlighting the privilege escalation aspect.
- **Ability to Inspect Processes:**  The attacker requires the ability to use tools like Process Explorer to discover the exposed process handles.
- **Ability to Write and Execute Code:** The attacker needs the capability to write, compile and execute code within the VDI session.
