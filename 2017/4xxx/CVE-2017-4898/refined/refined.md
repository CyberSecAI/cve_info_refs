Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-4898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a DLL loading issue in VMware Workstation Pro/Player. The "vmware-vmx" process loads DLLs from a path defined by a local environment variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL loading:** The application loads DLLs from a path controlled by a local environment variable, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking/planting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** A successful exploit allows a normal user to elevate their privileges to System level on the host machine where VMware Workstation is installed. This could grant full control over the host machine to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially place a malicious DLL at the location specified by the environment variable. When the "vmware-vmx" process starts, it will load the attacker's DLL, leading to the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a normal user on the host operating system with the ability to set or modify local environment variables, and create files in the specified path for the malicious DLL.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory specifically mentions that VMware thanks Ivil for reporting this vulnerability.
- The affected versions are VMware Workstation Pro/Player 12.x running on Windows. The fix is available in version 12.5.3.
