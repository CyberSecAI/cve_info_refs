Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-4913:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in the True Type Font parser within the TPView.dll component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow leading to potential memory corruption issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- On VMware Workstation, a guest OS could execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the host Windows OS.
- On a Horizon View Client, a View desktop could execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon View Client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation is possible through the processing of a crafted TrueType Font (TTF) file.
- The attack vector requires virtual printing to be enabled. This is not enabled by default on Workstation, but is enabled by default on Horizon View.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over the input that is processed by the vulnerable TTF parser.
- For Workstation, this could be a malicious guest OS.
- For Horizon View Client, this could be a malicious View desktop.
- Virtual printing must be enabled for the attack to work.
