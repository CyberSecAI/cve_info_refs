- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VMware NSX-V implementation of the OSPF protocol doesn't correctly handle link-state advertisements (LSAs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of OSPF LSAs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A rogue LSA can cause continuous sending of LSAs between routers, potentially resulting in a loop or loss of connectivity, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted or rogue LSA to the vulnerable NSX-V Edge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network packets, specifically OSPF LSAs, to the affected NSX-V Edge device. OSPF protocol must be configured on the NSX-V edge.
