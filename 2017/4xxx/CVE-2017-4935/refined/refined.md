- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the JPEG2000 parser within the TPView.dll, a component used by the Cortado ThinPrint virtual printing feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - On VMware Workstation, a guest operating system could execute code or perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the Windows host operating system.
    - On Horizon View Client, a View desktop could execute code or perform a DoS on the Windows host running the Horizon View Client.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires the virtual printing feature to be enabled. On Workstation, this feature is disabled by default, whereas it is enabled by default on Horizon View Client. A malicious guest or remote user on a Horizon View client can send specially crafted print data that triggers the out-of-bounds write in the JPEG2000 parser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For Workstation: Attacker needs to have control over a guest virtual machine with virtual printing enabled.
    - For Horizon View Client: The attacker needs to have control over a View desktop with virtual printing enabled.
