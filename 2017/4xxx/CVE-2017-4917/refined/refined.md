- **Root cause of vulnerability**: vSphere Data Protection (VDP) locally stores vCenter Server credentials using reversible encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reversible encryption of vCenter Server credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Plaintext credentials can be obtained, potentially leading to unauthorized access to vCenter Server.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the VDP appliance where the credentials are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the VDP appliance.
