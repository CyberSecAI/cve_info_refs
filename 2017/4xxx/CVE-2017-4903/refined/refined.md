- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uninitialized stack memory usage in the SVGA (graphics adapter) component of VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to uninitialized memory usage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A guest operating system could potentially execute code on the host operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious guest OS could trigger the uninitialized stack memory usage by interacting with the vulnerable SVGA component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run a virtual machine as a guest on a vulnerable hypervisor (ESXi, Workstation, or Fusion).
