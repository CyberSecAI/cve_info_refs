Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-4966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The RabbitMQ management UI stores signed-in user credentials in the browser's local storage without an expiration mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage:** User credentials, which are sensitive data, are stored in the browser's local storage.
*   **Lack of Expiration:** The stored credentials lack an expiration timeframe, making them persistently available.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can potentially retrieve the stored user credentials. This enables the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user, gaining access to the RabbitMQ management UI and its functionalities.
*   **Chained Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited as part of a chained attack, meaning it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve a broader malicious impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Browser-based Attack:** The attack is primarily executed through the user's browser. It could potentially involve malicious JavaScript executed within the browser context, designed to access the local storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within the user's browser context, which could occur via several methods:
    *   **Malicious Website:** The user could visit a malicious website that contains the attacker's script.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker could inject malicious code into a legitimate website (possibly another web service) that the user accesses, if the target's domain is in the same scope.
    *   **Compromised Browser:** If the user's browser or a related browser extension is compromised, the attacker can directly access the local storage data.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-4966 describes a vulnerability in the RabbitMQ management UI where user credentials are stored insecurely in the browser's local storage without expiration. This allows an attacker to potentially steal the credentials via a browser-based attack, leading to unauthorized access to the RabbitMQ management interface. The impact is significant because it allows attackers to bypass authentication.
