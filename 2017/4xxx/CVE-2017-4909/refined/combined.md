##### 1. Summary

VMware Unified Access Gateway, Horizon View and Workstation updates resolve multiple security vulnerabilities

#####

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware Unified Access Gateway (formerly called Access Point)
* VMware Horizon View
* VMware Horizon View Client for Windows
* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. Unified Access Gateway and Horizon View heap buffer-overflow vulnerability**

VMware Unified Access Gateway and Horizon View contain a heap buffer-overflow vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to execute code on the security gateway.

VMware would like to thank Claudio Moletta (redr2e) for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2017-4907 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**\*Formerly called Access Point.**

**b. Multiple heap-based buffer overflow issues via Cortado ThinPrint**

VMware Workstation and Horizon View Client contain multiple heap buffer-overflow vulnerabilities in JPEG2000 and TrueType Font (TTF) parsers in the TPView.dll. On Workstation, this may allow a guest to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs Workstation. In the case of a Horizon View Client, this may    allow a View desktop to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon View Client.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but it is enabled by default on Horizon View.

VMware would like to thank Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab and Gogil of STEALIEN working with ZDI for reporting these issues to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifiers CVE-2017-4908 (JPEG2000) and CVE-2017-4909 (TTF) to these issues.

**c. Multiple out-of-bounds read/write issues via Cortado ThinPrint**

VMware Workstation and Horizon View Client contain multiple out-of-bounds read/write vulnerabilities in JPEG2000 and TrueType Font (TTF) parsers in the TPView.dll. On Workstation, this may allow a guest to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs Workstation. In the case of a Horizon View Client, this may allow a View desktop to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon View Client.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but it is enabled by default on Horizon View.

VMware would like to thank Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab and Giwan Go of STEALIEN working with ZDI for reporting these issues to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifiers CVE-2017-4910 (JPEG2000), CVE-2017-4911 (JPEG2000) and CVE-2017-4912 (TTF) to these issues.

**d. Integer overflow vulnerability via Cortado ThinPrint**

VMware Workstation and Horizon Client contain an integer-overflow vulnerability in the True Type Font parser in the TPView.dll. On Workstation, this may allow a guest to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs Workstation. In the case of a Horizon View Client, this may allow a View desktop to execute  code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon View Client.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but it is enabled by default on Horizon View.
