Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-4909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the TrueType Font (TTF) parser within the `TPView.dll` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow in TTF parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- On VMware Workstation, a guest operating system could execute code or perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the host Windows OS.
- On Horizon View Client, a View desktop could execute code or perform a DoS on the Windows OS running the client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires virtual printing to be enabled.
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted TrueType Font (TTF) file processed by the vulnerable `TPView.dll`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For VMware Workstation, the attacker would need to have control within a guest OS.
- For Horizon View Client, the attacker would need to be able to influence the View desktop environment.
- In both cases, the attacker would need to be able to send a malicious TTF file that will be processed by the vulnerable component.

**Additional Notes:**
- Virtual printing is not enabled by default on Workstation, but it is enabled by default on Horizon View.
- The vulnerability affects VMware Workstation and Horizon View Client for Windows.
- The advisory indicates a Critical severity level for this vulnerability.
