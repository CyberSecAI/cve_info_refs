- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VMware Workstation installer improperly loads some DLL files, leading to a DLL hijacking issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL hijacking, improper DLL loading
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can load a DLL of their choice, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability occurs during the installation process of VMware Workstation. An attacker could replace or add a malicious DLL to a directory where the installer searches for DLLs, leading to the malicious code being executed during the install process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to place a malicious DLL file in a location that the installer will load from. This usually involves manipulating the filesystem on the target machine before the installation process.
