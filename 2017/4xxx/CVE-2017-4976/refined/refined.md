- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EMC ESRS Policy Manager contains an undocumented account (OpenDS admin) with a default password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The presence of an undocumented account with a default password constitutes a security vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker with knowledge of the default password can log in and gain administrator privileges to the local LDAP directory server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, and the attacker needs to know the default password to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to connect remotely to the vulnerable system and possess knowledge of the default password of the undocumented account.
