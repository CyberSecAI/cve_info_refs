##### 1. Summary

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion updates address multiple security vulnerabilities

#####

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware ESXi (ESXi)
* VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA)
* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
* VMware Fusion Pro, Fusion (Fusion)

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion stack overflow via authenticated VNC session**

VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.

**Note:** In order for exploitation to be possible in ESXi, VNC must be manually enabled in a virtual machine's .vmx configuration file. In addition, ESXi must be configured to allow VNC traffic through the  built-in firewall.

VMware would like to thank Lilith Wyatt and another member of Cisco Talos for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2017-4941 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**b. ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion heap overflow via authenticated VNC session**

VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a heap overflow via a specific set of VNC packets resulting in heap corruption. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.

**Note:** In order for exploitation to be possible in ESXi, VNC must be manually enabled in a virtual machine's .vmx configuration file. In addition, ESXi must be configured to allow VNC traffic through the built-in firewall.

**c. ESXi Host Client stored cross-site scripting vulnerability**

The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting Javascript, which might get executed when other users access the Host Client.

VMware would like to thank Alain Homewood of Insomnia Security for reporting this issue to us.
