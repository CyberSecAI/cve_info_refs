- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple out-of-bounds read/write vulnerabilities exist in the JPEG2000 parser within the `TPView.dll` library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read/write vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: On VMware Workstation, a guest OS could execute code or cause a denial-of-service on the host Windows OS. On Horizon View Client, a View desktop could execute code or cause a denial-of-service on the Windows OS running the Horizon View Client.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the processing of malformed JPEG2000 data by the vulnerable `TPView.dll` library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Exploitation requires virtual printing to be enabled. For Workstation, this is not enabled by default, whereas it is enabled by default for Horizon View Client. An attacker would need to control the data being processed by the vulnerable component. For Workstation, this could be through a malicious guest OS, and for Horizon View Client this could be through a malicious View desktop.
