- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the VMware NAT service when IPv6 mode is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A guest operating system can execute code on the host machine.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation through the VMware NAT service with IPv6 mode enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control a guest OS running on the vulnerable VMware product. IPv6 mode in VMNAT needs to be enabled (note, this is not enabled by default).
