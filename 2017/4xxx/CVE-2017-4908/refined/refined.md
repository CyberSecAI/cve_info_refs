The provided content relates to CVE-2017-4908.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the JPEG2000 and TrueType Font (TTF) parsers within the `TPView.dll` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Heap-based buffer overflow in the JPEG2000 parser specifically (CVE-2017-4908).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- On VMware Workstation: A guest operating system could execute code or perform a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Windows host running Workstation.
- On Horizon View Client: A View desktop could execute code or perform a DoS on the Windows OS running the Horizon View Client.

**Attack Vectors:**
Exploitation is possible through the processing of malicious JPEG2000 data via the virtual printing feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For VMware Workstation: The attacker would need to have control of a guest OS running on a vulnerable version of Workstation.
- For Horizon View Client: The attacker would need to have control over a View desktop that is connected to a vulnerable Horizon View client.
- Virtual printing must be enabled on the target system.
