**a. Use-after-free vulnerability in VMware NAT service**

VMware Workstation and Fusion contain a use-after-free vulnerability in VMware NAT service when IPv6 mode is enabled. This issue may allow a guest to execute code on the host.

**Note:** IPv6 mode for VMNAT is not enabled by default.

VMware would like to thank WenQunWang of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB for reporting this issue to us.

**b. Integer-overflow vulnerability in VMware NAT service**

VMware Workstation and Fusion contain an integer overflow vulnerability in VMware NAT service when IPv6 mode is enabled. This issue may lead to an out-of-bound read which can then be used to execute code on the host in conjunction with other issues.

**Note:** IPv6 mode for VMNAT is not enabled by default.

VMware would like to thank WenQunWang of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB for reporting this issue to us.
