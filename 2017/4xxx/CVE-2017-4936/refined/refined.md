The provided content is related to CVE-2017-4936.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities exist in the JPEG2000 parser within the `TPView.dll` component of VMware Workstation and Horizon View Client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities within the JPEG2000 parser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- On Workstation: A guest could potentially execute code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Windows OS that hosts the Workstation.
- On Horizon View Client: A View desktop could potentially execute code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Windows OS running the Horizon View Client.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation requires the virtual printing feature to be enabled. This is not enabled by default on Workstation but is enabled by default on Horizon View Client.
- The attacker would need to be a guest within a virtual machine or have access to a View desktop.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A malicious guest user within a VMware Workstation or Fusion environment, or an attacker with control over a View desktop, is required.
- They need to be able to trigger the parsing of a malicious JPEG2000 image through the virtual printing feature.
