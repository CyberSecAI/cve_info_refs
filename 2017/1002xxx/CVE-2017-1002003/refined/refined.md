### CVE-2017-1002003
The WordPress plugin wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app v1.1.4 has an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

- **Root Cause:** The plugin includes unlicensed vulnerable CMS software. The code in `/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/server/images.php` doesn't require authentication or check that the user is allowed to upload content, and it doesn't sanitize the file upload against executable code.
- **Vulnerability:** Unrestricted file upload leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including executable code (e.g., PHP shells), and gain remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack Vector:** By sending a POST request with a file to `/wp-content/plugins/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/server/images.php`, an attacker can upload a malicious file.
- **Required Capabilities:** No authentication is required. The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script.
