Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect default access permissions for Persistent Volumes (PVs) created by the Kubernetes Azure cloud provider.
*   In Kubernetes versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.5, these PVs were set to "container" scope instead of a more restrictive "private" scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Permissions:** The core issue is that PVs were provisioned with overly permissive default access settings.
*   **Publicly Accessible URI:**  The "container" scope exposed a URI that could be accessed without authentication over the public internet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker with the full URI of an actively provisioned PV could download the VHD file associated with that volume.
*   **No Retroactive Impact:** The vulnerability does not apply to volumes already deleted from the cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URI Access:** The primary attack vector is through direct access to the exposed URI.
*   **Privileged Cluster Access or Azure Portal Access:** The attacker needs either privileged access to the Kubernetes cluster or authenticated access to the Azure portal to obtain the full URI of a volume.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of URI:** The attacker must know the full URI of an affected Persistent Volume. This could be obtained through privileged access within the cluster or via the Azure portal.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the publicly exposed URI.
*   **Exploitable Kubernetes Version:** The Kubernetes cluster must be running versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.5 using the Azure cloud provider.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Kubernetes version 1.6.6 and is included in the upcoming 1.7.0 release.
*   Mitigation steps prior to upgrading involve changing permissions on running persistent volumes using the Azure CLI or Azure web portal, as detailed in the provided Microsoft link.
*   The content indicates that a CVE was requested but not yet issued, though it is confirmed to be CVE-2017-1002100 by the content.
