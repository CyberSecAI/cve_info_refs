Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002013:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `admin_setting.php` file of the "image-gallery-with-slideshow" WordPress plugin.
*   Specifically, the `imgid` parameter within the `$_REQUEST` array is used directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization on the `imgid` parameter allows for the injection of malicious SQL code. This specific instance is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the results of the query but can infer them using techniques like time-based delays.
*   The code at line 318 directly uses the unsanitized `$id` variable in an SQL query:  `$edit_img_result = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM `".$table_prefix."combo_image` WHERE image_id = ".$id);`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially manipulate the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
*   This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
*   It could also allow an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the WordPress installation or the server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the `admin.php` file of the WordPress admin panel using a crafted URL including the vulnerable parameter.
*   Specifically, the parameter `imgid` within the query string is the attack vector.
*   The `val` parameter must be set to `imgedit` in the request
*   The `gid` parameter is also required

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the WordPress admin panel to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be able to send crafted requests with the vulnerable `imgid` parameter in the URL to the vulnerable page.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of SQL injection techniques to successfully exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides SQLMap examples to illustrate how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The exploit code section shows how time-based blind SQL injection can be used to confirm the vulnerability.
*   The plugin version affected is 1.5.2.
*   The plugin has been closed and is not available for download on wordpress.org.
