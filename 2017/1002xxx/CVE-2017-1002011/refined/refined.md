Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-1002011:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Image Gallery with Slideshow" version 1.5.2 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying gallery names and descriptions. Specifically, the `$value->gallery_name` and `$value->gallery_description` variables are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the database.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with the ability to add or modify galleries and images can inject malicious JavaScript code into the database via the vulnerable fields. When other users with access to the gallery view the injected content, the malicious script will execute within their browsers. This could result in various impacts, including but not limited to session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement of the affected WordPress site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the plugin's admin interface, specifically when adding or editing image galleries, where the gallery name and description fields are vulnerable.
    *   The injected script is stored in the database and is executed when the page containing the vulnerable gallery name or description is viewed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have privileges to modify or add galleries/images in the affected WordPress site. This generally implies that they need to be a logged-in user with a certain level of access (e.g., administrator or editor).
