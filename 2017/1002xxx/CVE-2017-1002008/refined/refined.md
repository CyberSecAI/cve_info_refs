Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `download.php` file of the "Membership Simplified" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the code responsible for handling file downloads does not properly validate user privileges or sanitize user-provided file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin uses `$_GET['download_file']` to specify the file to be downloaded. The code attempts to sanitize this path by removing "../" sequences using `str_replace("../","",$fullPath)`. However, this is insufficient because it can be bypassed by using patterns like "..././" which, after the replacement, still resolve to "../".
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The `download.php` script does not check if the user has appropriate permissions to access the file, nor does it require users to be logged in. This allows any user, including unauthenticated ones, to request downloads of files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers can download arbitrary files from the server. This could include sensitive files like `wp-config.php` (containing database credentials), or system files like `/etc/passwd`, leading to potential compromise of the WordPress instance and the server it resides on.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted GET request to the `download.php` script. The `download_file` parameter is used to specify the file path using the path traversal technique.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WordPress website.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress admin panel.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Installation Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `download.php` file, typically found under `/wp-content/plugins/membership-simplified-for-oap-members-only/`.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet in `download.php` is:
    ```php
    $path = substr(getcwd(), 0, -50). "uploads/membership-simplified-for-oap-members-only/";
    $fullPath = $path.$_GET['download_file'];
    $fullPath = str_replace("../","",$fullPath);
    if ($fd = fopen($fullPath, "r")) {
    // ... file download code
    }
    ```
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to leverage path traversal using "..././" in the `download_file` parameter.
