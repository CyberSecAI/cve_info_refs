Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization of the `gallery_name` parameter in the `admin_setting.php` file of the "Image Gallery with Slideshow" WordPress plugin. This parameter is directly used in an SQL INSERT query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The code directly inserts the unsanitized `gallery_name` parameter into an SQL query, making it vulnerable to blind SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information from the database.
    *   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   Complete takeover of the WordPress site: By potentially injecting malicious code, an attacker could gain administrative control of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the WordPress admin interface targeting the plugin's `admin_setting.php` script. Specifically, the attacker must manipulate the `gallery_name` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to send POST requests to the WordPress admin panel. This implies the attacker would need at least some level of authenticated access to the WordPress backend.
*   The attacker must know the vulnerable URL and the parameter name `gallery_name`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes exploit code demonstrating the time-based blind SQL injection technique using `sqlmap`. This confirms the vulnerability and provides details on how it can be exploited.
*   The plugin was closed on April 5, 2017, and is no longer available for download from the official WordPress plugin directory. This implies that the vulnerability is likely not present in current versions of the plugin, if it was updated.
