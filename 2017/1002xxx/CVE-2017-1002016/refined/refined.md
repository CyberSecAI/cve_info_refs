Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `flickr-picture-download.php` file in the "flickr-picture-backup" WordPress plugin lacks proper authentication and file type validation. It directly processes the `url` parameter from the GET request without checking if the user is logged in or has the necessary permissions. It also doesn't validate the type of file being downloaded and saved, allowing arbitrary file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The script doesn't verify if the user making the request is authenticated or authorized to upload files, enabling any unauthenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The script downloads and saves the content from a provided URL without checking the file type or content. This allows an attacker to upload malicious files, such as PHP shells, to the server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The URL parameter is not sanitized or validated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP shell, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the website and the server.
*   **Website Defacement/Takeover:** The attacker could modify the website, steal data, install backdoors, or otherwise disrupt the site's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can send a GET request to the `flickr-picture-download.php` script, providing a URL to a malicious file in the `url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the "flickr-picture-backup" plugin is installed on the target WordPress site.
*   **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file (e.g. a php shell) accessible by the server.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided exploit code demonstrates how to use curl to send a request to the vulnerable script, specifying a URL to a PHP shell.
* The vulnerability exists because the plugin directly includes `wp-load.php` and `admin.php` but doesn't use the standard WordPress functions for user authentication and file uploads.
* The plugin was closed on September 3, 2014, and is not available for download, making it important for sites that might still have it installed to remove it.
