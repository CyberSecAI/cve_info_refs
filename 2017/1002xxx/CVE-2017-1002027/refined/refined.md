Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `rk-responsive-contact-form` WordPress plugin, specifically within the `rk_user_list.php` file. The `$delid` variable, obtained from the GET parameter `did`, is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `$delid` variable allows for SQL injection attacks. The vulnerability is blind, meaning the attacker doesn't receive direct output from the database. The attacker can use time-based techniques to extract data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
-  The attacker could manipulate or delete database records, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
- Complete database compromise is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` page with specific parameters.
- The `info` parameter is set to "del", and the vulnerable `did` parameter is injected with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress site with administrative privileges, as the vulnerable code resides in the admin area.
-  Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary requests to the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided exploit code example shows the use of `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability, highlighting time-based blind injection techniques.
- The plugin has been closed and is not available for download as of 2014.
- The plugin is very old and likely not in use, therefore exploitation is unlikely.
