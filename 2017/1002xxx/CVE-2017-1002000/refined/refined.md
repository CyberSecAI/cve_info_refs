Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-1002000:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `images.php` file within the `mobile-friendly-app-builder-by-easytouch` WordPress plugin. This file allows unrestricted file uploads without proper authentication or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `images.php` script doesn't require any authentication. This allows anyone to upload files to the server.
-   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The script doesn't check the file type being uploaded and does not sanitize the input against malicious code. This makes it possible to upload executable code (e.g. PHP scripts).
-   **Insecure code:** The plugin includes vulnerable CMS software from a third party and uses it without a proper license.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
-   **Full Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the web server, including access to sensitive data and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Direct HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `images.php` file, including a malicious file in the `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where the vulnerable WordPress plugin is installed.
-   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to authenticate to the WordPress site or have any specific user role.

**Additional Information:**
-   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP shell and execute commands on the target system. The exploit code is a python script that automates the process of uploading the malicious shell.
-   The vulnerable plugin was closed on WordPress.org on November 15, 2016, and is no longer available for download.
