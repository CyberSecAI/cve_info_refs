Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks in the `save_contact.php` file of the DTracker WordPress plugin. Specifically, the code doesn't verify if the user making the request is authorized to update contact information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication checks before performing critical operations (updating contact data in the `wp_contacts` table).
*   **Content Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious content, such as JavaScript, into database fields (`name`, `company`, `phone`, `country`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A successful attack can inject malicious JavaScript code into the database. This code is then executed when an administrator accesses the affected plugin's interface or views the contact data, leading to XSS.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The injected javascript could be used to perform actions as the admin, potentially leading to complete control over the site, as noted in the provided text ("I imagine you could get RCE similar to some exploits targeting the Wordpress JSON API vulnerability...").

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a simple HTTP POST request to the `save_contact.php` script.
*   **Direct Database Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows arbitrary data, including malicious scripts, to be directly inserted into the `wp_contacts` database table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated as a user or administrator to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed to make HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes example exploit code using `curl` to demonstrate how to inject JavaScript into the database.
*   The advisory also references another related vulnerability in the same plugin, CVE-2017-1002007, affecting the `save_mail.php` file, which has similar characteristics of missing authentication and content injection.
