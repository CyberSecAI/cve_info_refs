Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `updateDB.php` file of the "Membership Simplified" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `recordId` parameter from POST requests is directly inserted into SQL queries without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. This means that while an attacker cannot directly see the output of their injected SQL code, they can infer information based on the server's response time (time-based blind SQL injection).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database (including user credentials, configuration details, etc.).
- **Data manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database, potentially causing disruption of the plugin's functionality or the entire WordPress site.
- **Full system compromise:** In some cases, an attacker could leverage SQL injection to gain access to the underlying operating system and further compromise the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `updateDB.php` file with malicious SQL code injected into the `recordId` parameter.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `delete_media` action block (lines 56-65).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of the plugin's endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `updateDB.php` file and the required POST parameters (`action` set to `delete_media`).
- **Ability to send HTTP POST requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint with crafted payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to use `sqlmap` to detect and exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects the `delete_media` action, specifically the SQL query on line 62: `$query= "delete from $media\_table\_name where recordId= '".$\_POST['recordID']."' ";`.
- The code is vulnerable because it uses unsanitized user input (`$_POST['recordID']`) directly within the SQL query.
- The exploit code shows successful time-based blind SQL injection.
