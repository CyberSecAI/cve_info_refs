  "CVE-2017-1002102": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows containers using a secret, configMap, projected or downwardAPI volume to trigger deletion of arbitrary files and directories on the nodes where they are running.",
    "root_cause": "A symlink race in the OpenShift node process allows a malicious container to trick the node into deleting any file. The vulnerability exists because the volume isn't mounted read-only by the runtime, and there is a time between finding the file and deleting the file during which a malicious container can replace a target file with a symlink.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Symlink Race",
      "Insecure Volume Mounting"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious container running in a pod with a secret, configMap, downwardAPI or projected volume mounted can cause the Kubelet to remove any file or directory on the host filesystem.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious container is deployed in a pod with a vulnerable volume type mounted."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to deploy a container with secret, configMap, downwardAPI or projected volumes mounted (including auto-added service account token mounts).",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in Kubernetes versions 1.3.x-1.6.x, 1.7.0-1.7.13, 1.8.0-1.8.8, and 1.9.0-1.9.3. The fix involves mounting the affected volumes as read-only, which will cause write operations to result in errors."
