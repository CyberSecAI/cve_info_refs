# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This change is part of the fix to address [CVE-2017-1002102](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mm7g-f2gg-cw8g "CVE-2017-1002102") ([#60814](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60814)).

This change makes it so that containers cannot write to secret, configMap, downwardAPI and projected volumes since the runtime will now mount them read-only. This change makes things less confusing for a user since any attempt to update a secret volume will result in an error rather than a successful change followed by a revert by the kubelet when the volume next syncs.

It also adds a feature gate `ReadOnlyAPIDataVolumes` to a provide a way to disable the new behavior in 1.10, but for 1.11, the new behavior will become non-optional.

Also, E2E tests for downwardAPI and projected volumes are updated to mount the volumes somewhere other than /etc.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**

Fixes [#58719](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58719)

Fixes [#60814](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60814) for master / 1.10

**Release note**:

```
Changes secret, configMap, downwardAPI and projected volumes to mount read-only, instead of allowing applications to write data and then reverting it automatically. Until version 1.11, setting the feature gate ReadOnlyAPIDataVolumes=false will preserve the old behavior.

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I am afraid this is behavior change. Volumes that were not read-only are read-only now. As you can see in e2e test updates, it can break existing applications.  IMO it is the right way to go, however I am not sure a small release note is enough.  Applications that relied on persisting data in these locations were already broken, since the volume sync would remove that data at a later point in time. A release note seems sufficient to me (updated the release note with additional context) |

* Update statefulset.yaml

ConfigMaps are read-only since Kubernetes 1.9.4 ([kubernetes/kubernetes#58720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58720)). The rabbitmq-ha Chart uses a ConfigMap to provision /etc/rabbitmq. The official RabbitMQ docker image modifies these files in its docker-entrypoint.sh. This PR adds an initContainer to the StatefulSet to copy the configs from the ConfigMap to a new emptyDir volume.

## Description

[![@liggitt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980082?u=e6d3a90de563c894207290d21eb6987a1d45391a&v=4&size=48)](/liggitt)[liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)opened [on Mar 5, 2018](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60814#issue-302458948)

[CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)

This vulnerability allows containers using a secret, configMap, projected or downwardAPI volume to trigger deletion of arbitrary files and directories on the nodes where they are running.

Thanks to Joel Smith of Red Hat for reporting this problem.

**Vulnerable versions:**

* Kubernetes 1.3.x-1.6.x
* Kubernetes 1.7.0-1.7.13
* Kubernetes 1.8.0-1.8.8
* Kubernetes 1.9.0-1.9.3

**Vulnerable configurations:**

* Clusters that run untrusted containers with secret, configMap, downwardAPI or projected volumes mounted (including auto-added service account token mounts).

**Vulnerability impact:**

A malicious container running in a pod with a secret, configMap, downwardAPI or projected volume mounted (including auto-added service account token mounts) can cause the Kubelet to remove any file or directory on the host filesystem.

**Mitigations prior to upgrading:**

Do not allow containers to be run with secret, configMap, downwardAPI and projected volumes (note that this prevents use of service account tokens in pods, and requires use of [`automountServiceAccountToken: false`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#use-the-default-service-account-to-access-the-api-server))

**Fixed versions:**

* Fixed in v1.7.14 by [[1.7] Automated cherry pick of #58720 #60342 #60516](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60516)
* Fixed in v1.8.9 by [[1.8] Automated cherry pick of #58720 #57326 #60342 #60515](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60515)
* Fixed in v1.9.4 by [[1.9] Automated cherry pick of #58720 #57326 #60342 #60258](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60258)
* Fixed in master by [Ensure that the runtime mounts RO volumes read-only #58720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58720) (included in v1.10.0-beta.1 and up, will be in v1.10.0)

**Fix impact:**

Secret, configMap, downwardAPI and projected volumes will be mounted as read-only volumes. Applications that attempt to write to these volumes will receive read-only filesystem errors. Previously, applications were allowed to make changes to these volumes, but those changes were reverted at an arbitrary interval by the system. Applications should be re-configured to write derived files to another location.

### @joelsmith **[joelsmith](/joelsmith)** commented [Dec 19, 2017](#issue-283373765) • edited Loading

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This change affects the way that secret, configmap, downwardAPI and projected volumes (which all use the same underlying code) implement their data update functionality.

* Instead of creating a subdirectory hierarchy that will contain symlinks to each actual data file, create only symlinks to items in the root of the volume, whether they be files or directories.
* Rather than comparing the user-visible data directory to see if an update is needed, compare with the current version of the data directory.
* Fix data dir timestamp format year
* Create `..data` symlink even when a data volume has no data so consumers can have simplified update watch logic.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:

Fixes [#57421](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57421)

Fixes [#60814](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60814) for master / 1.10

**Release note**:

```
Fix a bug affecting nested data volumes such as secret, configmap, etc.

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

This block was confusing to me. I think it would look better like this:

```
	if err != nil {
		if !os.IsNotExist(err) {
			glog.Errorf("%s: error reading link for data directory: %v", w.logContext, err)
			return err
		}
		// although Readlink() returns "" on err, don't be fragile by relying on it (since it's not specified in docs)
		// empty oldTsDir indicates that it didn't exist
		oldTsDir = ""
	}
```

nice cleanup removing from the struct 👍

Can we just use `dataDirName` instead of `oldTsDir` and avoid adding a param to the func?

On this one, yes, we could keep the struct, then do something like:

```
 shouldWrite, err := shouldWriteFile(path.Join(w.targetDir, dataDirName, userVisiblePath), fileProjection.Data)

```

and then `shouldWriteFile()` would follow the `..data` symlink.

I did this on purpose, but I don't know that it's better. My thinking was "If we have a problem removing 1 file, isn't it better to clean up as much of the rest of it as possible?" but I'm not sure what the answer is. The other problem with the new approach is that any errors but the last one will not be seen by the caller (but will be in the error log). I'm happy with either behavior (old/new).

I don't think so because we need an absolute path for the `root` passed to `filepath.Walk()`. Also, because `filepath.Walk()` doesn't follow symlinks, we'd have to construct an absolute path out of `w.targetDir` and `dataDirName`, and then we'd need to follow that symlink to get the path. My thought is that it's better to follow the symlink once (to create `oldTsDir`) and pass that to anything that needs it.

| I tested it with various volumes (downward, secrets, configmap), they get updated with the API object changes correctly and any other files created either by user or kubelet are ignored and not removed.  I noticed only one difference in handling directories: instead of a directory with symlink to a file there is a symlink to directory with a file:  Old: `dir/subdir/file -> ..data/dir/subdir/file` and `file` has the right content Now: `dir -> ..data/dir` and `..data/dir` has the right `subdir/file`.  I don't think this can cause any issues. Reading `dir/subdir/file` leads to the right content in both cases.  /approve |

UPSTREAM: 57422: Rework method of updating atomic-updated data volumes

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This is a backport of https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57422

This change affects the way that secret, configmap, downwardAPI and projected volumes (which all use the same underlying code) implement their data update functionality.

* Instead of creating a subdirectory hierarchy that will contain symlinks to each actual data file, create only symlinks to items in the root of the volume, whether they be files or directories.
* Rather than comparing the user-visible data directory to see if an update is needed, compare with the current version of the data directory.
* Fix data dir timestamp format year
* Create `..data` symlink even when a data volume has no data so consumers can have simplified update watch logic.

| We are seeing some differences in volumeMounts after upgrading to 1.8.8 and think this might be the cause:  1.8.8:  ``` kubectl exec flipper-8496978cdf-l94lv -- ls -l /etc/confd/conf.d/cernan.toml -rw-r--r--    1 root     root           215 Feb 15 00:12 /etc/confd/conf.d/cernan.toml  ```  1.8.6:  ``` kubectl exec flipper-67b85b69d-wnnh6 -- ls -l /etc/confd/conf.d/cernan.toml lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            28 Feb 15 00:01 /etc/confd/conf.d/cernan.toml -> ../..data/conf.d/cernan.toml  ```  This seems to work fine for most things, but for example `confd` tries to list files in this directory and can't see them:  ``` [pid   332] futex(0xc420030810, FUTEX_WAIT, 0, NULL2018-02-15T01:24:17Z flipper-8496978cdf-l94lv ./confd-0.15.0-linux-amd64[329]: DEBUG Loading template resources from confdir /etc/confd  <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... write resumed> )       = 136 [pid   330] <... pselect6 resumed> )    = 0 (Timeout) [pid   334] stat("/etc/confd",  <unfinished ...> [pid   330] clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... stat resumed> {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0777, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0 [pid   330] <... clock_gettime resumed> {tv_sec=8644, tv_nsec=900518357}) = 0 [pid   334] lstat("/etc/confd/conf.d",  <unfinished ...> [pid   330] epoll_wait(4,  <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... lstat resumed> {st_mode=S_IFLNK|0777, st_size=13, ...}) = 0 [pid   330] <... epoll_wait resumed> [], 128, 0) = 0 [pid   334] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME,  <unfinished ...> [pid   330] pselect6(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=20000}, NULL <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... clock_gettime resumed> {tv_sec=1518657858, tv_nsec=84617856}) = 0 [pid   334] clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {tv_sec=8644, tv_nsec=900886308}) = 0 [pid   330] <... pselect6 resumed> )    = 0 (Timeout) [pid   334] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME,  <unfinished ...> [pid   330] clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... clock_gettime resumed> {tv_sec=1518657858, tv_nsec=84816499}) = 0 [pid   330] <... clock_gettime resumed> {tv_sec=8644, tv_nsec=901001962}) = 0 [pid   334] clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  <unfinished ...> [pid   330] pselect6(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=20000}, NULL <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... clock_gettime resumed> {tv_sec=8644, tv_nsec=901075021}) = 0 [pid   334] openat(AT_FDCWD, "/proc/sys/kernel/hostname", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3 [pid   334] epoll_ctl(4, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 3, {EPOLLIN|EPOLLOUT|EPOLLRDHUP|EPOLLET, {u32=919723888, u64=139767745470320}}) = 0 [pid   330] <... pselect6 resumed> )    = 0 (Timeout) [pid   334] fcntl(3, F_GETFL <unfinished ...> [pid   330] clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... fcntl resumed> )       = 0x8000 (flags O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) [pid   330] <... clock_gettime resumed> {tv_sec=8644, tv_nsec=901370126}) = 0 [pid   334] fcntl(3, F_SETFL, O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE <unfinished ...> [pid   330] pselect6(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=20000}, NULL <unfinished ...> [pid   334] <... fcntl resumed> )       = 0 [pid   334] read(3,  <unfinished ...> [pid   330] <... pselect6 resumed> )    = 0 (Timeout) [pid   334] <... read resumed> "flipper-8496978cdf-l94lv\n", 512) = 25 [pid   330] clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  <unfinished ...> [pid   334] epoll_ctl(4, EPOLL_CTL_DEL, 3, 0xc42004265c <unfinished ...> [pid   330] <... clock_gettime resumed> {tv_sec=8644, tv_nsec=901649274}) = 0 [pid   334] <... epoll_ctl resumed> )   = 0 [pid   330] pselect6(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=20000}, NULL <unfinished ...> [pid   334] close(3)                    = 0 [pid   334] getpid()                    = 329 [pid   334] write(2, "2018-02-15T01:24:18Z flipper-849"..., 106 <unfinished ...> [pid   330] <... pselect6 resumed> )    = 0 (Timeout) [pid   330] clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {tv_sec=8644, tv_nsec=902026848}) = 0 2018-02-15T01:24:18Z flipper-8496978cdf-l94lv ./confd-0.15.0-linux-amd64[329]: WARNING Found no templates  ``` |

| The change in behavior is strange, but I assume [#58720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58720) will break what this was setup for anyway, so I'll just audit our usage and make sure nobody's doing this anywhere anymore. |

UPSTREAM: 57422: Rework method of updating atomic-updated data volumes

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This is a backport of https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57422

This change affects the way that secret, configmap, downwardAPI and projected volumes (which all use the same underlying code) implement their data update functionality.

* Instead of creating a subdirectory hierarchy that will contain symlinks to each actual data file, create only symlinks to items in the root of the volume, whether they be files or directories.
* Rather than comparing the user-visible data directory to see if an update is needed, compare with the current version of the data directory.
* Fix data dir timestamp format year
* Create `..data` symlink even when a data volume has no data so consumers can have simplified update watch logic.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1551818#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-06 00:29:27 UTC  ``` A symlink race in the openShift node process allows a malicious container to trick the node into deleting any file.  Every sync iteration, the atomic writer code walks the volume looking for files that shouldn't be there or files that have changed.  When it finds files that shouldn't be there, it adds them to a list. Once it's finished walking the tree, it sorts the list lexicographically then starts at the end (to make sure that files are removed before the directories that contain them) and removes them one by one.  Because (a) the volume isn't mounted read-only by the runtime and (b) there is a time between finding the file and deleting the file, a malicious container can set up conditions to win a race such that the file to be deleted is removed and replaced with a symlink (to a node file to be deleted) between the time that the kubelet finds the file and the time it deletes it.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1551818#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-06 00:32:37 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joel Smith (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1551818#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-03-12 19:38:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.3   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.4   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.5   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.6   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.7  Via RHSA-2018:0475 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0475](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0475)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1551818#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-12 22:39:32 UTC  ``` Created kubernetes tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1554539](show_bug.cgi?id=1554539 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-1002102 kubernetes: Malicious containers can delete any file from the node [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1551818#c6)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-13 00:21:09 UTC  ``` Created origin tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1554573](show_bug.cgi?id=1554573 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-1002102 origin: kubernetes: Malicious containers can delete any file from the node [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1551818#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:05:07 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
