The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1002022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `$_REQUEST['survey']` parameter in the `questions.php` file of the Surveys WordPress plugin. This unsanitized input is directly incorporated into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin directly uses user-supplied input within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
*   Retrieve sensitive data from the database.
*   Modify data within the database.
*   Potentially gain control of the database server, depending on the database configuration and the attacker's skills.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `$_REQUEST['survey']` parameter in the `questions.php` file. An attacker can manipulate the `survey` parameter value in the HTTP request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
