Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-1002001:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control and file sanitization in the `images.php` file located within the `mobile-app-builder-by-wappress` WordPress plugin. This file allows unauthenticated users to upload files to the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `images.php` file does not enforce any authentication checks, allowing any user to upload files.
-   **Lack of File Sanitization:** The uploaded files are not sanitized to prevent the execution of malicious code. This enables attackers to upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
-   Upload and execute arbitrary code on the server.
-   Potentially gain full control over the vulnerable website and server.
-   Deface the website, steal sensitive data, or install further malware.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a direct HTTP POST request to the `images.php` file of the plugin, without needing any prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No prior access or authentication to the WordPress site is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
The attacker can be an external user, not authenticated to the WordPress site.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerable plugin was closed on November 3, 2016.
- The exploit code provided in the "exploit-db.com" content demonstrates how to upload a PHP shell using a `curl` command and a Python script.
