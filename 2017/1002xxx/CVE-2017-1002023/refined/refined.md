Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `easy-team-manager` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without any prior validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection vulnerability, meaning the attacker cannot see the results of their SQL queries directly, but can infer results based on the application's response time or behavior. The vulnerability exists in the `easy_team_manager_desc_edit.php` file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code directly uses user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) in an SQL query without proper sanitization using functions like `esc_sql`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the WordPress database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker could also potentially modify or delete data within the database if they have sufficient privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In certain scenarios, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be escalated to achieve complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in the HTTP GET request.
*   **Target File:** The vulnerability exists in the `easy_team_manager/inc/easy_team_manager_desc_edit.php` file.
*   **Access Point:** Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the admin panel, targeting `admin.php?page=easy_team_manager_edit&id=`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with "edit team" privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `id` GET parameter and how to manipulate it.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques to craft suitable payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located within lines 85-95 of `easy_team_manager/inc/easy_team_manager_desc_edit.php`.
*   The provided `sqlmap` exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can detect and exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The plugin is closed and not available for download, likely due to the discovery of this vulnerability.
*   The exploit code provided uses time-based blind SQL injection and union-based injection techniques to demonstrate the vulnerability.
