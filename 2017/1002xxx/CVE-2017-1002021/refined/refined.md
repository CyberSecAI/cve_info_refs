Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-1002021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the `individual_responses.php` file of the Surveys WordPress plugin.
*   The code fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `$survey_id` variable, derived from `$_REQUEST['survey']` and `$_REQUEST['result']` are directly embedded into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the WordPress database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  In severe cases, successful SQL injection can lead to the complete compromise of the WordPress system and the underlying server.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially overload the database server, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerable parameters are accessible via HTTP requests to the `individual_responses.php` file within the WordPress admin panel.
*  Specifically, the `survey` and `result` parameters within the `$_REQUEST` array are used without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress administrator to access the vulnerable pages in the `/wp-admin/` directory.
*   **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with malicious SQL code within the vulnerable parameters.

**Details beyond the CVE description:**
* The provided content includes specific code snippets illustrating the vulnerability in `individual_responses.php`.
* It also includes exploit code using SQLMap, showing different SQL injection techniques.
* The content specifies the affected plugin version, which is 1.01.8.
* The advisory also mentions that similar vulnerabilities exist in `survey_form.php` (CVE-2017-1002020) and `questions.php` (CVE-2017-1002022), indicating a widespread lack of sanitization practices in the plugin.
