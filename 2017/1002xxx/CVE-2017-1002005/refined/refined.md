Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2017-1002005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `delete.php` file of the DTracker WordPress plugin.
*   User-supplied input from the `contact_id` POST parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `contact_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Attackers can use SQL injection to manipulate or delete arbitrary data within the WordPress database. In the specific case of the vulnerable code, the attacker can delete records from the `wp_contacts` table.
*   **Potential for further compromise:**  Successful SQL injection can lead to further exploitation, such as data extraction, unauthorized access or even complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-content/plugins/dtracker/delete.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious SQL Payload:** The attacker includes malicious SQL code within the `contact_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory also mentions CVE-2017-1002004, which is a similar SQL injection vulnerability in the `download.php` file of the same plugin but using a GET parameter.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates the use of `sqlmap` to identify and exploit both SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*  The plugin is closed and not available for download which prevents further exploitation.
