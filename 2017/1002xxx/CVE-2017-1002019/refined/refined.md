Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002019:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `eventr` WordPress plugin's `event_form.php` file does not properly sanitize the `$_REQUEST['event']` parameter before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, when editing an event, the code retrieves event details using a SQL query that includes the unsanitized input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection. This means the attacker doesn't directly see the output of the query, but they can infer information by timing how long the query takes to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure/Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially take complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `event` parameter of the URL when accessing `event_form.php` with the `action=edit` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to modify events, based on the advisory. This is also evident through the usage of cookies in the provided exploit.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** The vulnerable code is located in the WordPress admin panel, requiring the attacker to be an authenticated user of the system.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable plugin and its functionality.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also details how to exploit the vulnerability using `sqlmap`, a penetration testing tool. This shows that the vulnerability can be exploited relatively easily.
*   The exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code into the `event` parameter in the URL, using the `SLEEP()` function to cause time delays, thus confirming blind SQL injection is possible.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `event_form.php` file in line 10.
*   The advisory also mentions that there is a similar blind SQL injection vulnerability, CVE-2017-1002018, in the `attendees.php` file, which uses the `$_REQUEST['event']` parameter unsanitized as well.
