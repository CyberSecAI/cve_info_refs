Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The plugin `add-edit-delete-listing-for-member-module` fails to sanitize user-supplied input via the `$act` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. Specifically, the vulnerability is a *blind* SQL injection as the query results aren't directly visible. The parameter vulnerable is the `id` parameter in the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can use SQL injection to potentially gain access to sensitive data in the database, modify data, or execute arbitrary commands on the server via SQL injection features. In this case the attacker can extract data from the database, as shown in the provided exploit code using `sqlmap`.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via HTTP GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` page, specifically with `page=member_add&act=upd&id=[INJECTION]`. The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be logged in as an administrator.
