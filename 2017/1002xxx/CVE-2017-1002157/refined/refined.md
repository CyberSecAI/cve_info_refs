Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002157:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `loads_all` function in `modulemd/__init__.py` was using `yaml.load_all`, which is inherently insecure because it allows for arbitrary code execution when processing YAML input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization of YAML data
- Use of `yaml.load_all` instead of `yaml.safe_load_all`

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system by crafting a malicious YAML payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted YAML file/string to a vulnerable `modulemd` application/service using `yaml.load_all`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious YAML file or string to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required beyond being able to pass user-controlled data to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `yaml.load_all` with `yaml.safe_load_all` in version `1.3.2` of `modulemd`.
- The issue was discovered and fixed within the context of the `modulemd` project.
