Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the VapidLabs advisory, which corresponds to CVE-2017-1002026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `edit_event_category` function in the Event Espresso Lite plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input from the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows for a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `$id` parameter from the request is directly inserted into a SQL query within the `edit_event_category` function.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$id=$_REQUEST['id'];
$results = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM ". EVENTS_CATEGORY_TABLE ." WHERE id =".$id);
```

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious SQL code. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, event details, etc.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Modifying or deleting critical data, potentially disrupting the event management system.
    *   **Complete Server Compromise:** In severe cases, the attacker might be able to gain control of the database server, leading to a complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `page=event_categories` and `action=edit` parameters, along with the vulnerable `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user capable of editing event categories within the WordPress site running the vulnerable Event Espresso Lite plugin.
*   **Basic HTTP request manipulation:** Ability to craft http requests to include the malicious sql code in the `id` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided SQLmap exploit code demonstrates how to detect and exploit the vulnerability.
*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the plugin version 3.1.37.11.L is vulnerable.
*   The plugin has been closed on the wordpress.org plugin directory due to the security issue.
