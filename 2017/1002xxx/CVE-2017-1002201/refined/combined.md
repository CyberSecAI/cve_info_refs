# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

| [Description](#c0)  Bill Kenworthy    2004-11-03 15:30:27 UTC  ``` I use ufed regularly.  After a full system rebuild I ended up with an evolution with no ssl support.  Found that ufed removed the ssl and mozilla flags when saving (they are not in make.conf).  However, starting ufed again shows them present! (X is set, but the + flag for make.conf is absent).  euse -c shows the flags as not present - and if enabled ufed will remove them again.  If I try and build evolution with the flags present (added by euse), evo still gets no ssl support.  This is (the ufed part) happening on two systems - both old systems (running gentoo > 2 yrs) continuously upgraded, though one has recently had major dramas with a disk failure and subsequent insitu rebuild.  This is driving me crazy (I need evo with ssl/tls support) BillK ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Harald van Dijk (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 19:22:14 UTC  ``` You didn't include the output of emerge --info, so this is a little bit of a guess, but:  ufed automatically removes redundant flags from your make.conf. If you have mozilla installed, the mozilla flag will already be set. If you have openssl installed, or if you are using a profile that sets it by default, the ssl flag already will be set. There's no need to also place these in make.conf, so ufed removes them. You can check the output of emerge --info and emerge -pv evolution to make sure that the flags are set.  "If I try and build evolution with the flags present (added by euse), evo still gets no ssl support." That really can't be a problem with ufed. Does it look like the same problem as [bug #68267](show_bug.cgi?id=68267 "RESOLVED FIXED - evolution +ssl flag ignored while compiling") to you? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Bill Kenworthy    2004-11-05 23:19:41 UTC  ``` Thanks for the explanation.  the ssl flag was being removed even when I didnt have mozilla in the USE.  I have now added mozilla, and as long as I dont run ufed it (and ssl) stays - so I guess its still broke.  The evolution problem does look like [bug #68267](show_bug.cgi?id=68267 "RESOLVED FIXED - evolution +ssl flag ignored while compiling"), looks like it might be time to move to evo2 - hope they get the stable fixed quick!   emerge info (ssl and mozilla readded using euse after ufed removed them both)  Portage 2.0.51-r2 (default-x86-2004.2, gcc-3.3.4, glibc-2.3.4.20040808-r1, 2.6.9-gentoo-r1-1 i686) ================================================================= System uname: 2.6.9-gentoo-r1-1 i686 AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2500+ Gentoo Base System version 1.4.16 distcc 2.16 i686-pc-linux-gnu (protocols 1 and 2) (default port 3632) [enabled] ccache version 2.3 [enabled] Autoconf: sys-devel/autoconf-2.59-r5 Automake: sys-devel/automake-1.8.5-r1 Binutils: sys-devel/binutils-2.14.90.0.8-r1 Headers:  sys-kernel/linux26-headers-2.6.8.1-r1 Libtools: sys-devel/libtool-1.5.2-r5 ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="x86" AUTOCLEAN="yes" CFLAGS="-w -march=athlon-xp -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -mfpmath=sse,387 -falign-functions=4" CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu" COMPILER="" CONFIG_PROTECT="/etc /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb /usr/kde/2/share/config /usr/kde/3.1/share/config /usr/kde/3.2/share/config /usr/kde/3.3/env /usr/kde/3.3/share/config /usr/kde/3.3/shutdown /usr/kde/3/share/config /usr/lib/mozilla/defaults/pref /usr/share/config /usr/share/texmf/dvipdfm/config/ /usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/ /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/config/ /usr/share/texmf/tex/platex/config/ /usr/share/texmf/xdvi/ /var/bind /var/qmail/control" CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK="/etc/gconf /etc/terminfo /etc/env.d" CXXFLAGS="-w -march=athlon-xp -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -mfpmath=sse,387 -falign-functions=4" DISTDIR="/usr/portage/distfiles" FEATURES="autoaddcvs ccache distcc distlocks sandbox" GENTOO_MIRRORS="ftp://mirror.pacific.net.au/linux/Gentoo ftp://mirror.averse.net/pub/gentoo <http://mirror.averse.net/pub/gentoo/> ftp://ftp.las.ic.unicamp.br/pub/gentoo/ <http://gentoo.netnitco.net>" MAKEOPTS="-j6" PKGDIR="/usr/portage/packages" PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp" PORTDIR="/usr/portage" PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/portage" SYNC="rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage" USE="3dnow X X509 Xaw3d aac aalib activefilter aim alsa apache2 apm avi berkdb bitmap-fonts blas bonobo cdr crypt cscope cups curl devmap dga divx4linux dnd doc dv dvb dvd dvdr dvdread encode escreen esd ethereal evo f77 faad fam fbcon ffmpeg fftw flac foomaticdb freetds freetype gb gcj gd gd-external gdbm ggi gif gimp gimpprint ginac glade glgd glut gnome gnomedb gnuplot gphoto2 gpm graphviz gs gsl gstreamer gtk gtk2 gtkhtml guile hdf hdf5 icq imagemagick imap imlib imlib2 jabber java javascript jpeg jpeg2k kde lcms libg++ libgda libsamplerate libwww lzo lzw-tiff mad maildir mdb mikmod mmx mng motif mozctl mozilla moznocompose moznoirc moznomail mozp3p mozplaintext mozsvg mozxmlterm mp3 mpeg mpeg4 mplayer msn mupad-noscilab music mysql native ncurses network nls nocardbus nocd nptl ntlm nvidia nviz oav objc odbc offensive oggvorbis openal opengl operanom2 oscar oss pam parse-clocks passfile pcap pcntl pcre pdf pdfkit pdflib pear-db perl php physfs pic plotutils png pnp povray ppds python qemu-fast qt quicktime quotes readline rtc samba scanner sdl session slang smime sms sndfile soap sox speedo spell sse sse2 ssl stencil-buffer svg svga tcltk tcpd tetex tga tidy tiff transcode transparent-proxy truetype truetype-fonts type1 type1-fonts usb uudeview v4l v4l2 vcd vcdimager videos virus-scan vnc wmf wsconvert x86 xface xine xinetd xml xml2 xmms xpm xprint xrandr xscreensaver xsl xv xvid xvmc yv12 zlib zvbi linguas_en_AU" ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Marcin Kryczek (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-06 04:55:38 UTC  ``` well -

If the output is identical, the flags are indeed redundant, and there is no ufed bug here. If the output is not identical, can you show it?

Its support for stacked profiles is incomplete. However, this isn't related to the original bug report; the reporter isn't even using a stacked profile.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2864-1              debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Utkarsh Gupta

Package        : ruby-haml
Version        : 4.0.7-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-1002201

In ruby-haml, which is an elegant, structured XHTML/XML templating
engine, when using user input to perform tasks on the server,
characters like < > " ' must be escaped properly. In this case,
the ' character was missed. An attacker can manipulate the input to
introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
4.0.7-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-haml packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-haml please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-haml>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Always escape `'` in Haml::Helpers.#html\_escape.

```
In some tests, `attr_wrapper` is changed to be ignored.

I'll split its fix to other commis because not Haml::Helpers but
Haml::AttributeBuilder is responsible for that.

Package        : ruby-haml
Version        : 4.0.5-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-1002201

In haml, when using user input to perform tasks on the server, characters
like < > " ' must be escaped properly. In this case, the ' character was
missed. An attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional
attributes, potentially executing code.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
4.0.5-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-haml packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

## How to fix?

Upgrade `haml` to version 5.0.0.beta.2 or higher.

## Overview

[haml](https://rubygems.org/gems/haml) is a layer on top of HTML or XML that's designed to express the structure of documents in an easy way by using indentation rather than closing tags and allowing Ruby to be embedded with ease.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). When using user input to perform tasks on the server, characters like < > " ' must be escaped properly. In this case, the ' character was missed. An attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code.

```
engine = Haml::Engine.new("%p&= foo")
engine.render(Object.new,:foo => 'h"i"')
# => "&lt;p&gt;h&amp;quot;i&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;"
engine.render(Object.new,:foo => "h'i'")
# => "&lt;p&gt;h'i'&lt;/p&gt;\n"

```
## Disclosure Timeline

* February 6th, 2017 - Reported the issue to package owner.
* February 8th, 2017 - Issue fixed.
* February 26th, 2017 - Version `v5.0.0.beta.2` released.
## Details

A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.

This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.

Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.

The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.

### Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
| **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
| **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
| **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

### Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

* Web servers
* Application servers
* Web application environments

### How to prevent

This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:

* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.
* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
* Redirect invalid requests.
* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.2 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
