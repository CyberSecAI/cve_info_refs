Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-1002024

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and access control in the `upload_json.php` file within the KindEditor application. Specifically, the file does not validate user input or check if the user is authorized to upload files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `upload_json.php` script allows users to upload files to the server without proper authorization or sanitization checks.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not validate the uploaded filename or file content. While it prevents direct server-side code execution by blocking common executable extensions (.php, .phtml, etc.), it doesn't prevent uploading potentially harmful .html files.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Although not explicitly stated as an exploit vector, the provided output URL implies a possible directory traversal by using `../` in the path. The provided curl example utilizes a `dir` parameter with the value `file` which results in an uploaded file being placed in `attached/file`, however it is not stated if this parameter can be manipulated to traverse directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files (specifically .html files) to the server.
*   **Potential for Phishing/XSS:** Although the advisory says "But no server side code exec," it should be noted that uploading arbitrary .html files can enable Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or allow an attacker to host phishing pages from the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The arbitrary file upload can be used to upload files with sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `upload_json.php` file.
*   **File Upload:** An attacker sends a POST request containing the file content, along with a filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable KindEditor application.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability doesn't require any authentication. An unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code is a simple curl request:

```bash
curl -F "imgFile=@test.html" http://example.com/kindeditor/php/upload_json.php?dir=file
```
This command uses curl to send a POST request to the `upload_json.php` script. It includes the `imgFile` parameter (which contains the content of the `test.html` file) and a `dir` parameter.

The vulnerability is present in KindEditor versions 4.1.12 and earlier.
