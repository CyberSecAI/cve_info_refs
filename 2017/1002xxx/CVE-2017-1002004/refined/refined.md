Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `download.php` file of the DTracker WordPress plugin.
*   User-supplied input from the `id` parameter in the GET request is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `download.php` file.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is: `$doc_id = $_GET['id']; $file = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE ID = $doc_id " );`

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can perform arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive data from the WordPress database.
    *   Data modification: Altering data in the database, potentially disrupting website functionality.
    *   Complete system compromise: In some cases, an attacker could leverage SQL injection to achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL, without requiring prior authentication to the WordPress instance.
*   Example of a vulnerable URL: `http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/dtracker/download.php?id=[SQL Injection Payload]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication or special privileges.
*   The attacker only needs to have network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the `download.php` file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept exploit code using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects version 1.5 of the DTracker WordPress plugin.
*   The `vapidlabs.com` content indicates that there is a second related vulnerability with CVE-ID CVE-2017-1002005 in the same plugin.
*   The content also includes details such as the operating system, web server and database server that the SQL injection is detected on.
