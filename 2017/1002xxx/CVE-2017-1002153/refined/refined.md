Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-1002153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insufficient path normalization of SCM (Source Code Management) URLs when checking against an allowed/blocked list. The Koji system did not properly normalize paths, allowing bypasses of the blacklist. Specifically, if `/forks` was blacklisted, `./forks` or `//forks` could still be used to access the blacklisted location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal/Bypass:** The core weakness is the failure to normalize the SCM URL paths. This allowed attackers to use relative paths like `./forks` or double slashes `//forks` to circumvent the intended blacklist.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system did not properly sanitize or canonicalize input paths before checking against the blacklist, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Restricted Resources:**  An attacker could bypass the intended SCM URL restrictions, potentially gaining access to restricted or blacklisted repositories or locations.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the specific impact is limited to bypassing the URL blacklist, this could be a step toward further unauthorized actions, depending on what those blacklisted resources contained or allowed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated SCM URL:** An attacker could provide a crafted SCM URL that uses relative paths (e.g., `./forks`) or double slashes (`//forks`) to bypass the blacklist.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to provide or manipulate the SCM URL used by the Koji system. This suggests the attacker needs to be someone who can initiate actions that involve the system processing SCM URLs.
*   No specific system privileges or initial access was mentioned in the provided text beyond the general access of someone able to provide a URL to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content included a patch to address the issue by running `normpath` over the SCM URL. It was also noted that `normpath` did not handle double slashes `//` at the beginning of a path, thus additional checks were implemented in the final patch.
*   The issue was assigned CVE-2017-1002153.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Koji version 1.14.
