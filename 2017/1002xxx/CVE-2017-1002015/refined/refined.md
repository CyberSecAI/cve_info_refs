Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-1002015:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `image-gallery-with-slideshow/admin_setting.php` file of the WordPress plugin "Image Gallery with Slideshow". Specifically, the `selectMulGallery` POST parameter is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The unsanitized `selectMulGallery` parameter allows for the injection of malicious SQL code. Because there is no output directly displaying the result of the query this is a blind injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
  - Modification or deletion of data.
  - Complete compromise of the WordPress installation and the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `admin_setting.php` script with the `image_submit` parameter set, and the malicious SQL injection code embedded within the `selectMulGallery` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress plugin endpoint.
- The attacker would need to be able to access the WordPress admin interface to trigger this specific code path. This indicates they would require administrator-level or similar privileges.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable code snippet from `admin_setting.php`:
 ```php
 492 if(isset($_POST['image_submit']))
 493 {
 494 $gallery_id = $_POST['selectMulGallery'];
 495 $update_gallery_query = "UPDATE `".$table_prefix."combo_image` SET gallery_id=".$gallery_id." WHERE gallery_id = '0'";
 496 $wpdb->query($update_gallery_query);
 ```
- The `$gallery_id` is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `selectMulGallery` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code shows how to use `sqlmap` to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerabilities in this plugin.
- This vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-1002011, CVE-2017-1002012, CVE-2017-1002013 and CVE-2017-1002014) found within the same plugin.
- The plugin has been closed on wordpress.org as of April 5, 2017, indicating that the vulnerability is no longer being patched.
