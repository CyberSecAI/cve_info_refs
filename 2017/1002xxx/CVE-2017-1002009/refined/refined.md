Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002009:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input passed via POST requests to the `updateDB.php` file in the "Membership Simplified" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `recordId` parameter is directly included in SQL queries without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `delete` action. The code does not sanitize the `recordId` parameter before using it in a SQL DELETE query.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The code doesn't verify if the user is authorized to perform database updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use SQL injection to:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Modify or delete arbitrary data within the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the system.
    - Cause denial of service by disrupting database functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through crafted POST requests to `updateDB.php`.
- **`recordId` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `recordId` parameter in the POST request to inject SQL code.
- The specific SQL injection point for CVE-2017-1002009 is within the `delete` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication to the WordPress site. This is because the authorization check is missing.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`updateDB.php`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code using `sqlmap` demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited.
- The advisory also mentions a similar vulnerability `CVE-2017-1002010` within the `delete_media` action of the same script.
- The vulnerability is present in "Membership Simplified" WordPress plugin version 1.58.
