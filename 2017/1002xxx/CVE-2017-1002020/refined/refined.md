Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `$_REQUEST['survey']` parameter before using it in a SQL query within the `survey_form.php` file of the Surveys WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['survey']`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameter, allowing them to potentially:
   - Access, modify, or delete database data.
   - Extract sensitive information from the database.
   - Potentially gain control of the server if the database user has sufficient permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `edit.php` page within the WordPress admin panel. The attacker modifies the `survey` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- They would likely need access to the WordPress admin panel, as `edit.php` is usually within that section.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and its parameters.
- Some knowledge of SQL is needed to craft the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `survey_form.php`:
```php
$survey_details = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT name,description,status FROM {$wpdb->prefix}surveys_survey WHERE ID=$_REQUEST[survey]");
```
The `$_REQUEST['survey']` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization or escaping mechanisms, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

The exploit code shows usage of `sqlmap` to exploit this vulnerability by injecting SQL payloads into the `survey` parameter:
```
http://192.168.0.169/wordpress/wp-admin/edit.php?page=surveys%2Fsurvey_form.php&survey=*&action=edit
```

The sqlmap output confirms the presence of:
- error-based SQL injection
- time-based blind SQL injection
- UNION query SQL injection

The advisory also lists two other vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-1002021 and CVE-2017-1002022) in the same plugin.
