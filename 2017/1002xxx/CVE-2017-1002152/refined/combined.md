## Description

[![@bowlofeggs](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/354506?u=a92c5957a061ca15fbd9549f0ef40d2a8aee1fc6&v=4&size=48)](/bowlofeggs)[bowlofeggs](https://github.com/bowlofeggs)opened [on Aug 10, 2017](https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1740#issue-249394149)

[Marcel reported](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1478587) that it is possible to inject JavaScript into Bodhi's web interface through Bugzilla ticket subjects. The reporter cited [an update](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-3c92db10b8) that did not properly escape tags from the bug it was associated with.

We should run the bugzilla text through bleach, similar to what we do for comments from our users.

This PR has three commits. The first adds tests for `bodhi.server.util.bug_link()`. The second modifies it to use `bleach()` to sanitize the bug title and adds more tests to ensure that tags are encoded to render instead of to be HTML themselves. The third renames the test module to match the module being tested.
