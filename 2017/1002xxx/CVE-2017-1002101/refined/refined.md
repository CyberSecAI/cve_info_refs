Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1002101:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Kubernetes handles subpath volume mounts. When a container uses a subpath to mount a volume, the Kubelet incorrectly follows symlinks within the volume to access locations outside the intended scope, including the host filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect symlink resolution:** The Kubelet, running as root, doesn't properly validate symlinks within the volume mount, allowing traversal outside the intended volume path.
- **Lack of proper volume mount isolation:** The design allowed for containers to bypass intended volume mount restrictions and access sensitive areas of the host filesystem.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file access:** A compromised or malicious container could gain read and write access to arbitrary files and directories on the host filesystem.
- **Node compromise:** Attackers could leverage this access to potentially gain full control over the host node.
- **Privilege escalation:** Even non-privileged containers can be used to exploit this vulnerability if they can control their own volume mounts or if the pod spec is controllable by a malicious user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Pod Specs:** Attackers can create specially crafted Pods which leverage a subpath volume mount, combined with malicious code within a container, that replaces the targeted location with a symlink to redirect the mount outside of the volume to the hosts file system.
- **Compromised Container:**  An attacker who has gained access to a container, or can influence it's behavior, can use a subpath volume mount to escape the container boundaries and access the host's filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Control over Pod Specs:** Attackers need the ability to create or modify pod specifications to include a subpath volume mount, often requiring RBAC access to do so, or influence over the pod spec for a given deployment.
- **Container Access:** In some instances, an attacker may need initial access to a container to create the symlinks necessary for the exploit to succeed.
- **Basic understanding of Kubernetes volumes and symlinks** is needed to craft the attack.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is primarily exploitable when `GOPATH` mode is enabled in the `go` tool.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 were affected and received a fix for it in RHSA-2018:0475.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Kubernetes versions v1.7.14, v1.8.9, v1.9.4, and master, via PRs #61047, #61046, #61045, and #61044, respectively.
- SUSE Linux Enterprise products, openSUSE, and other distributions were also affected and released patches to address the vulnerability.
- Mitigation prior to patching involved preventing untrusted users from creating pods or disabling all volume types via PodSecurityPolicy.
- The vulnerability has been labeled as `kind/bug` and `priority/critical-urgent` in the Kubernetes repository.
- A github repo, `bgeesaman/subpath-exploit`, contains examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
