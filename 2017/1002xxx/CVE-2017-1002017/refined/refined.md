Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-1002017

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the `gift-certificate-creator` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize user-supplied data submitted through the gift certificate form before displaying it on the admin page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the database through the gift certificate form and executed when an administrator views the entries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `gc-list.php` file doesn't sanitize user inputs when displaying the entries.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Any user can submit data through the publicly accessible gift certificate form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed within the administrator's browser session when viewing the certificate requests.
- **Account Takeover:** Through JavaScript, an attacker can potentially steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites or initiate downloads of malware.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the appearance of the admin page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Publicly Accessible Form:** The attack vector is the `[gift_certificate_form]` shortcode, which renders a form on the front-end of the WordPress site.
- **Form Submission:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code within the user-supplied input fields such as `cert_amount`, `user_name`, `receip_name`, `cc_sec_code`, and `receip_address`.
- **Database Storage:** The malicious code is stored in the WordPress database.
- **Admin Panel Display:** When an administrator views the stored entries through the admin panel, the unsanitized code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges.
- **Website Visitor:** Any visitor can access the form and submit malicious content.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `giftcertificates.php` at line 141 when processing the form submission and in `gc-list.php` when displaying the data.
- The vulnerable form contains the following fields:
  - `cert_amount`
  - `user_name`
  - `receip_name`
  - `cc_sec_code`
  - `receip_address`
- The plugin utilizes the `$_REQUEST` array to retrieve the user-provided input without sanitizing it before storage or display.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates a simple XSS injection using the `alert()` function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory notes that a "BeEF hook" could also be injected, implying the potential to gain more persistent control.
- The plugin is not tested with the latest WordPress versions, indicating potential further security issues.
