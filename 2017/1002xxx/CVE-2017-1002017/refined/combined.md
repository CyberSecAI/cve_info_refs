| Advisory #: 191 |
| --- |
| **Title:** Unauthenticated Stored XSS Vulnerability in Wordpress plugin gift-certificate-creator v1.0 |
| **Author:** Larry W. Cashdollar, @\_larry0 |
| **Date:** 2017-05-15 |
| **CVE-ID:**[[CVE-2017-1002017](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1002017)] |
| **CWE:** |
| **Download Site:** <https://wordpress.org/plugins/gift-certificate-creator/> |
| **Vendor:** Bob Cares https://bobcares.com/ |
| **Vendor Notified:**  2017-05-17 |
| **Vendor Contact:** plugins@wordpress.org |
| **Advisory:** <http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=191> |
| **Description:** Gift Certificate Creator WordPress plugin allows you to manage gift certificates on your website. In a convenient front-end UI provided by this plugin, your site visitors can enter the amount and user details. On form submission, the user details will be sent to the administrator. Also, the administrator can view the list of all the certificate requests. |
| **Vulnerability:**Publically accessible pages that are using the shortcode ‘[gift\_certificate\_form]’ allow any user to add gift certificate entries into the database. These entries are listed by the Wordpress administrator when visiting the plugin admin page. This action is performed by gc-list.php which doesn't sanitize the entries before displaying them. This allows malicious javascript to be injected into the WordPress database. In file giftcertificates.php 141: if ($\_REQUEST['action'] == 'Submit') { 144: //if (!empty($\_REQUEST['cert\_amount']) && !empty($\_REQUEST['cc\_number']) && !empty($\_REQUEST['cc\_sec\_code'])) { 145: if (!empty($\_REQUEST['cert\_amount']) && !empty($\_REQUEST['cc\_sec\_code'])) { 147: $gcmObj->createNewGCM($\_REQUEST); 149: writeLog(" amount ".$\_REQUEST['cert\_amount']." and email ".$\_REQUEST['cc\_sec\_code']." are posted successfully", basename(\_\_LINE\_\_), basename(\_\_FILE\_\_)); 152: $gcmObj->sendGCMReportEmail(GC\_MAIL\_TO, GC\_MAIL\_FROM, GC\_MAIL\_SUBJECT, $\_REQUEST); 153: $\_REQUEST = array(); 212- <form method="get" name="gc\_form" action=""> 213- <table class='gc\_form'> 214- <tr> 215- <th>Certificate Amount:</th> 216: <td><input type="text" name="cert\_amount" value="<?php echo $\_REQUEST['cert\_amount']; ?>" placeholder ="$"></td> 217- </tr> 218- <tr> 219- <th>Your Name:</th> 220: <td><input type="text" name="user\_name" value="<?php echo $\_REQUEST['user\_name']; ?>"> (optional)</td> 221- </tr> 222- <tr> 223- <th>Recipient Name:</th> 224: <td><input type="text" name="receip\_name" value="<?php echo $\_REQUEST['receip\_name']; ?>"> (optional)</td> 225- </tr> 226- <tr> 227- <th>Recipient Email:</th> 228: <td><input type="text" name="cc\_sec\_code" value="<?php echo $\_REQUEST['cc\_sec\_code']; ?>"></td> 229- </tr> 230- <tr> 231- <th>Recipient Address:</th> 232: <td><textarea name="receip\_address" value="<?php echo $\_REQUEST['receip\_address']; ?>"></textarea> 233- </tr> 234- <tr> 235- <td colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><input type="submit" value="Submit" name="action"></td> 236- </tr> 237- </table> |

Purchased this thing for 20 from their website. Right off the bat it breaks the css of the wordpress back end as soon as you install it. After install if you go to your all pages section it is all out of whack, spent about an hour trying to trouble shoot but just moved on and contacted support. they did respond with an email but that was over a week ago and nothing since. now I am back at testing and trying to fix this thing but even after that it wont connect to paypal, even though it has all the areas to enter paypal info. I got this to be a time saver for me, I got that wrong.
