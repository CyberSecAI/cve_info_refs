Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `$_REQUEST['event']` parameter in the `attendees.php` and `event_form.php` files of the Eventr WordPress plugin. This allows for direct injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `attendees.php` and `event_form.php` files. This means an attacker cannot directly see the results of their queries but can infer information based on response times or errors.
*  Unsanitized Input: Specifically, the code directly uses the `$_REQUEST['event']` parameter within the SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Potential Takeover:**  Through SQL injection, an attacker may be able to gain administrative access to the WordPress site, leading to complete takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET parameters:** The attack vector is through the `event` parameter within HTTP GET requests to the `attendees.php` and `event_form.php` files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify events in the WordPress system. This suggests that the vulnerability is exploitable by users with appropriate roles and privileges within the WordPress site that has the vulnerable plugin installed.

**Technical Details:**

*   The code snippets show how the `$_REQUEST['event']` parameter is used directly in the SQL queries:
    *   In `attendees.php`:  `WHERE EA.event_ID=$_REQUEST[event] $search`
    *   In `event_form.php`:  `WHERE ID = $_REQUEST[event]`
*   The exploit code provided demonstrates the use of `sqlmap` to identify and exploit this vulnerability via time-based blind SQL injection, which involves injecting SQL commands that cause delays in the server response.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin is no longer available for download from the official WordPress Plugin Directory, as it was closed on March 13, 2014.
*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it includes the exact vulnerable code snippets and the SQLmap exploit commands.
