- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of user-supplied input, leading to persistent cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: Embedding malicious JavaScript code via user-supplied input in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject user-supplied input into the vulnerable areas of the IBM Business Process Manager application's Web UI. A user with lower level privileges can cause this to happen.
