- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to IBM BPM reflecting untrusted user input without fully removing HTML markup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, which can alter the intended functionality of the application and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web user interface by injecting malicious Javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to input data into the application's web interface, which will then be reflected back to other users of the application. The attacker requires low privileges and user interaction, according to the CVSS vector (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
