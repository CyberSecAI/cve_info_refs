- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a password being returned in an HTTP response, allowing a local attacker to obtain sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information disclosure via HTTP response.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can obtain highly sensitive information, specifically a password returned in an HTTP response.
- **Attack vectors**: Unspecified vectors that allow a local attacker to access the HTTP response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the system where the IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor is installed.
