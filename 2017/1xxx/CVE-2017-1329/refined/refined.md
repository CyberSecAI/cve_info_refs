Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-1329:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, which allows a remote attacker to inject malicious HTML code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTML Injection. This is a type of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can inject malicious HTML code into the application. When a victim views the injected content, the malicious HTML code executes within the victim's browser, in the security context of the hosting site. This can lead to various attacks, including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Phishing

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker injects malicious HTML code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious HTML code into the IBM Quality Manager application. The attacker needs low privileges (`PR:L`)

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in IBM Quality Manager (RQM).
- The CVSS score is 5.4, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is remediated in Rational Quality Manager 6.0.4 or later, or version 6.0.2 iFix017 or later. For version 5.x, upgrade to 5.0.2 iFix26 or later.
- The user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited `UI:R`.
- The scope is changed because the code executes within the security context of the hosting site `S:C`.
- The confidentiality and integrity impact are low `C:L/I:L`, while availability is not affected `A:N`.
