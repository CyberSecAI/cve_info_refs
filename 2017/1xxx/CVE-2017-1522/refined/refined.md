- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in IBM Content Navigator and CMIS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS). The software does not properly neutralize user-supplied input that is used in the generation of web pages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. This can alter the intended functionality and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding malicious JavaScript code into the web interface. This requires a user to interact with the malicious code, which is reflected in the output.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the application's web UI. This generally involves finding an input field or parameter that is not properly sanitized before being rendered on a page. User interaction is required for the XSS payload to be triggered. The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L).
