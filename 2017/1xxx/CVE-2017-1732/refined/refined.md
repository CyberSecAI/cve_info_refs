- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from IBM Security Access Manager for Enterprise Single-Sign On (ISAM ESSO) not setting the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to set the secure attribute on cookies, which can lead to exposure of session tokens/cookies via insecure channels.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If an attacker can intercept network traffic, they can potentially obtain session cookies and authorization tokens, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts or resources.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack through interception of unencrypted HTTP traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the ISAM ESSO server. This can be done through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or other network sniffing methods.
