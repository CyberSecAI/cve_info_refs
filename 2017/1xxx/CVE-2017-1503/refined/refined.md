- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Edge Caching Proxy component of WebSphere Application Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP response splitting vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially manipulate the HTTP response by injecting malicious headers, possibly leading to various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious data into HTTP requests that are processed by the Edge Caching Proxy, an attacker can control parts of the HTTP response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Edge Caching Proxy. The specific requirements depend on the application's usage of the proxy and its handling of user input.
