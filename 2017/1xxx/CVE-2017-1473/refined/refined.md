- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Access Manager Appliance uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to intercept network traffic and decrypt it, requiring high attack complexity (AC:H) but no privileges (PR:N). No user interaction is required (UI:N). The scope of the attack is unchanged (S:U), and confidentiality is the primary concern (C:H) with no impact to integrity or availability (I:N/A:N).
