  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_8bf392c8_20250125_020255.html",
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in FreeBSD's stack guard-page implementation, specifically how it interacts with memory regions mapped below the stack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient protection when a memory region mapped below the stack grows up and clashes with the stack."
      ],
       "impact": "A denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Allocate memory using mmap until it reaches a certain point below the stack, then trigger stack growth that will overwrite the mmap region."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "Local user can execute the provided exploit code.",
      "additionalDetails": "The provided code demonstrates a crash caused by writing to an address outside the stack bounds after triggering the vulnerability."

    {
      "source": "www.qualys.com_d2de76d5_20250125_020257.html",
        "rootCause": "The FreeBSD kernel's `vm_map_growstack` function has a logic error where it does not correctly handle the case when the start of the stack equals the end of a memory region below it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The stack guard page logic only prevents downward stack growth collisions but not upward memory region collisions. An incorrect check in `vm_map_growstack` allows the stack to grow into another memory region.",
        "The stack guard-page, is not physically mapped into the address space",
         "The stack guard-page can be bypassed if a memory region is mapped directly below the stack, and grows upwards.",
         "The secondary stack guard-page provided by FreeBSD's thread library (libthr) does not mitigate the primary stack guard-page vulnerabilities"
      ],
       "impact": "This can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior. By controlling the memory region below the stack, a malicious actor could overwrite stack data or cause a crash",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Allocate memory until the start of the stack is close to a memory region, trigger stack growth to move stack pointer to memory region directly below the stack, write to memory region, causing crash."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "Local user with the ability to allocate memory.",
      "additionalDetails": "The advisory details the stack clash vulnerability, guard page weaknesses, and various exploits/proof of concepts across different OSs and applications. It mentions CVE-2017-1084 as related to FreeBSD's stack guard-page vulnerabilities."
