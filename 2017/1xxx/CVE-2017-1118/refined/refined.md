- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrectly configured security policy in IBM WebSphere MQ Internet Pass-Thru (MQIPT) where IP addresses not listed in the security policy file with accept and resolve socket permissions cause MQIPT to stop responding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the MQIPT security policy was not configured to allow connections from all required IP addresses
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the MQIPT to become unresponsive, effectively leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending connection requests from IP addresses not configured in the MQIPT security policy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send connection requests to the MQIPT. No authentication is required, but the attacker needs to use an IP address not configured to be accepted by the MQIPT.
