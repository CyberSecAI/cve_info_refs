- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM BPM allows users to interact with one another without fully removing HTML markup, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied HTML content, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session. This can result in altering intended functionality, possibly leading to credentials disclosure, and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code through user interaction features, such as social features, or mentions within the platform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to interact with other users through the vulnerable application features to inject malicious content. The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability and user interaction (UI:R) is required by a victim.
