- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM OpenPages GRC Platform with OpenPages Loss Event Entry (LEE) application has an insecure object reference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure object reference leading to potential exposure of sensitive information, including private APIs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could obtain sensitive information, potentially including private APIs, which could be used in further attacks against the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-accessible (AV:N) and does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges are required (PR:N), the attacker does not need to be authenticated or have specific access to the system.
