- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the instance user interface of IBM Business Process Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the user interface, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the instance user interface, suggesting that an attacker could exploit it through crafted input to the application that is then displayed to users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would likely need to be able to inject malicious code into the user interface, possibly through an intermediary such as a malicious link or compromised input field.
