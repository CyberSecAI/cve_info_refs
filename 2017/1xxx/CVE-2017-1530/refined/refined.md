- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Process Admin Console is vulnerable to a persisted Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persisted Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious javascript code into the web UI of the IBM BPM.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user can inject the malicious javascript code. The user interaction is required for the XSS attack to take effect on other users.
