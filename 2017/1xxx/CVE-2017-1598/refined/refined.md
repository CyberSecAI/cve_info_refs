- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N), Attack complexity is high (AC:H), No user interaction is required (UI:N).

This vulnerability allows for a disclosure of sensitive information but not modifications (C:H, I:N, A:N).
