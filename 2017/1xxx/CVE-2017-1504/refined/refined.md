- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  WebSphere Application Server traditional 9.0.0.4 introduced a new feature using the `PasswordUtil` command to enable AES password encryption.  However, some passwords did not get encrypted as expected when this feature was used, leading to weaker than expected security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Inconsistent or incomplete AES encryption of passwords when using the new `PasswordUtil` feature.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Potential for weaker than expected security for passwords that were intended to be encrypted with AES, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by the use of a specific command line utility (`PasswordUtil`) to enable AES encryption, therefore local access may be required to execute the command and create the vulnerable configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to access the configuration of the WebSphere Application Server and potentially leverage the weaker encryption of passwords. The CVSS vector indicates low privileges are required for exploitation.
