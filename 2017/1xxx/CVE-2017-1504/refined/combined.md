# Security Bulletin: Weaker than expected security in WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2017-1504)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

WebSphere Application Server traditional 9.0.0.4 added a new feature using the PasswordUtil command to enable AES password encryption. If you used this feature, then you have a potential for weaker than expected security since some passwords did not get encrypted as you might have expected. If you didn't use this new feature, then you are not affected by this vulnerability. This does not affect passwords with the default XOR encoding, or passwords with custom encryption.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1504](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1504) IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 9.0.0.4 could provide weaker than expected security after using the PasswordUtil command to enable AES password encryption.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129579> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability affects the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server:

* Version 9.0.0.4 - if you used the PasswordUtil command to enable AES password encryption.

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the interim fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI82602 for each named product as soon as practical. This does not affect passwords with the default XOR encoding, or passwords with custom encryption. **For WebSphere Application Server traditional:**  **For V9.0.0.4:**

· Apply Interim Fix [PI82602](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043939)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 9.0.0.5 or later.
