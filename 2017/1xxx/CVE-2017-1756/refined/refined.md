- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect cache headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information might be stored locally due to incorrect cache headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user on the same system could access the locally stored sensitive information of another user. This leads to information leakage.
- **Attack vectors:**  Local access to the system where the affected IBM Business Process Manager or WebSphere Lombardi Edition is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be a user on the same system where the vulnerable software is deployed.
