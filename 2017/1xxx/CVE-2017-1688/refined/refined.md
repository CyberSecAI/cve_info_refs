Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in IBM DOORS Next Generation (DNG/RRC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the web UI of the application. This allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code within the web UI. This can lead to:
*   Altering the intended functionality of the application.
*   Potential disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
*   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of IBM DOORS Next Generation. An attacker would inject malicious Javascript into an input field that is not properly sanitized, and then that injected code could be executed when a user views the compromised page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user of the application with the ability to input data into the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to find an input field that is not sanitized by the application.
*   The attacker would need to convince another user to view the page where the malicious javascript would be executed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided text groups several XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-1607, CVE-2017-1650, CVE-2017-1688, and CVE-2017-1689) under a single security bulletin. All four CVEs have identical descriptions, but they are distinct vulnerabilities.
*   The affected product versions are Rational DOORS Next Generation 6.0 through 6.0.4.
*   Fixes are available as iFixes for versions 6.0.2, 6.0.3 and 6.0.4. The advisory recommends upgrading to the latest fixed version.
*   The CVSS v3 vector for the vulnerability is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), which translates to:
    *   **AV:N (Network):** Attack vector is network-based.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** Attack complexity is low.
    *  **PR:L (Low):**  Privileges Required is low.
    *   **UI:R (User Interaction):** User interaction is required
    *   **S:C (Changed):** Scope is changed.
    *   **C:L (Low):** Confidentiality impact is low.
    *   **I:L (Low):** Integrity impact is low.
    *   **A:N (None):** Availability impact is none.
