- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Streams Web console is vulnerable due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when parsing text, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session, and altering the intended functionality of the web application.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to embed malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Web UI of the affected IBM Streams product and inject the malicious code. The attacker would need to have at least the privileges of a user that can interact with the vulnerable part of the web application.
