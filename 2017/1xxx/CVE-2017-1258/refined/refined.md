- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because IBM Security Guardium does not perform an authentication check for a critical resource or functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for critical functions, allowing anonymous access to protected areas.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Anonymous users can access protected areas, potentially leading to unauthorized viewing or modification of data, though the specific impact is categorized as low confidentiality and low integrity impact with no impact to availability (C:L/I:L/A:N).
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks (AV:N) where an unauthenticated user can access the vulnerable resources remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges are required, an attacker only needs network access (PR:N).
