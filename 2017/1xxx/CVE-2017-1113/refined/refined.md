  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the web UI, which can alter the intended functionality and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to input data that is then displayed in the web UI without proper sanitization. User interaction is required, as the victim needs to browse to a page containing the malicious code."
