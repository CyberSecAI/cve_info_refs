Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager storing sensitive information within URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Exposure of sensitive data:  Sensitive information is included directly in the URL, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data: The application inappropriately stores sensitive information in a location that is not designed for secure storage, namely, URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: If an attacker gains access to the URLs containing the sensitive information, they can potentially disclose the sensitive information.
- Exposure can happen via server logs, referrer headers, or browser history.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Server logs: An attacker might gain access to server logs that record the URLs.
- Referrer header: The sensitive information can be exposed through the referrer header if a user clicks on a link containing sensitive information in the URL, passing the information in the header to a malicious site.
- Browser history: An attacker could gain access to browser history and view the URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the means by which the vulnerable URLs are recorded/transmitted, such as access to server logs, referrer headers, or browser history. No direct access to the application is required, the attacker could obtain the URLs passively.
