- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a regular expression attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious regular expression that can cause the system to slow or hang.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service, causing the system to slow down significantly or even hang.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and capable of providing the malicious regex input.
