- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code within the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow attackers to alter the intended functionality of the application, potentially leading to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web user interface, where a user can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker capable of injecting JavaScript code into the application is required to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is also required for the malicious script to execute.
