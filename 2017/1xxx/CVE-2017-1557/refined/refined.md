- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A malicious request sent by an IBM MQ application with the authority to connect to a remote queue manager can cause undefined behavior within the channel process servicing that connection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the channel process's handling of certain requests, leading to a potential loss of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to undefined behavior within the channel process, including a loss of service for other connections handled by the same process. This can result in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application with the ability to connect to a remote queue manager can send crafted requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an application with the authority to connect to a remote queue manager.
