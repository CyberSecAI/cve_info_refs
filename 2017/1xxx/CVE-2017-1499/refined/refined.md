- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to include arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable web server.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker can include arbitrary files
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web server. The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with low privileges (PR:L).
