- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unspecified vulnerability exists in IBM Platform LSF that allows a local user to escalate privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation, user impersonation, potential root access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can impersonate arbitrary users to submit jobs to LSF, and potentially run LSF jobs as root, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system running a vulnerable version of IBM Platform LSF or IBM Spectrum LSF.
