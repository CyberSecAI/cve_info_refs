Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to embed arbitrary JavaScript code within the web UI.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI, where the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to embed content in the Web UI (low privilege, PR:L) and requires a user to interact with the malicious content (UI:R). The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions 6.0.2 and 6.0.3 of Rational DOORS Next Generation.
*   The CVSS v3 vector is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). This indicates:
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The attack can be launched remotely over a network.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    *  **PR:L (Low):** The attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability
    *   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required.
    *   **S:C (Changed):** The vulnerability has a scope change.
    *  **C:L (Low):** Confidentiality impact is low.
    *  **I:L (Low):** Integrity impact is low.
    *   **A:N (None):** There is no availability impact.
*   Fixes are available in iFix005 (or later) for version 6.0.3 and iFix011 (or later) for version 6.0.2.
*   There are no known workarounds or mitigations.
