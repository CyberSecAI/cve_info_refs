- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A directory traversal attack vulnerability exists in IBM UrbanCode Deploy, allowing an attacker to upload new versions of a plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal, lack of authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can alter UCD deployments by uploading malicious plugin versions, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, data breaches, or service disruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via a directory traversal path to upload plugins.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the UCD server and the ability to craft malicious requests to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.
