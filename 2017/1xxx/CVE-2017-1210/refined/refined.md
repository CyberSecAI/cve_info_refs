- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted request or annotation in ViewONE could inject a realistic-looking log line.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Log injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into log files that appear legitimate. This could potentially be used to hide malicious activity or mislead administrators.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted request or annotation to the ViewONE application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can perform this attack remotely over the network.
