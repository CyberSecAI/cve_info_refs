Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-1276:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation (DNG/RRC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The software is susceptible to XSS attacks, where malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within the Web UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the web application.
*   **Credentials Disclosure:** This could potentially lead to the disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
*  **Altering Intended Functionality:** The injected JavaScript can alter the intended functionality of the web application, causing unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web UI:** The attack vector is through the Web UI of the affected software.
*   **User Interaction:** The user is required to interact with the malicious content, usually by loading a page with the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious script, as implied by the CVSS vector.
*   **Network Access:** The attack is executed over the network (AV:N).
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires some user interaction (UI:R), like a victim visiting a specially crafted page.
