- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the authorization function of the IBM Worklight Framework's RESTful Web API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the "scope" parameter when it's used in the authorization process. Specifically, if a "realm" value that is not defined in `authenticationConfig.xml` is provided as the "scope" parameter, it results in an HTTP 403 Forbidden response and the provided value is reflected in the body of the HTTP response. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page that is reflected as part of the error response. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, credential theft, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL request targeting the RESTful Web API of IBM Worklight Framework. An attacker needs to insert malicious javascript into the "scope" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted request to the vulnerable API endpoint, and must be able to manipulate the scope parameter.
