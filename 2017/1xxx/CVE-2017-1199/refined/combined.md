CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability is known to affect the following offerings:

| **Affected IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server** | **Affected Versions** |
| --- | --- |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server | 10.1 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server | 11.0 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server | 11.3 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server | 11.4 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server | 11.5 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server | 11.6 |

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the fix as soon as practical. Please see below for information on how to apply the fix:

If you have customized the UI and the source code is already available skip step #1 and #2.

1. Locate the com.ibm.mdm.sample.ds.webapp.ear.zip file from MDM sample.

2. Import the projects into RAD and follow [Downloading, configuring and deploying the sample](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.5.0/com.ibm.mdmhs.dat.stdshp.doc/t_download_configure_ear.html)

3. Open SessionFilter.java from CommonUIModel

- In doFilter method add the below code provided code at line number 75

httpResponse.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'");

//#Used by Firefox until version 23, and Internet Explorer version 10 (which partially implements Content Security Policy).

httpResponse.setHeader("X-Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'");

//Used by Chrome until version 25

httpResponse.setHeader("X-WebKit-CSP", "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'");

//<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers>

httpResponse.setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options","nosniff");

httpResponse.setHeader("X-XSS-Protection","1");

//one year = 31536000

httpResponse.setHeader("Strict-Transport-Security","max-age=31536000");

- After the code changes are done build all projects

4. Export CustomerDataStewardship as EAR

Then From RAD, File -> Export -> Ear File (Under Java EE)

in EAR Export wizard

- select EAR Project name as 'CustomerDataStewardship'

- Then provide the destination , that earfile name

5. Deploy the this new exported EAR on server

Note: Before installing EAR on server make sure ClientAuthentication.properties and mdmUIConfiguration.properties of propertiesUI.jar have valid connection properties.
