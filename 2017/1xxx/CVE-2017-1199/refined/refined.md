- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to disclosure of credentials within a trusted session. This could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious javascript code into the application's web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject javascript code into the web UI. A low privileged user can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
