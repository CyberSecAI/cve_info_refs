- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) Server uses a weak algorithm for encrypting passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak password encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A database administrator may be able to decrypt IBM Spectrum Protect client or administrator passwords, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a database administrator with access to the password database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a database administrator with access to the encrypted passwords.
