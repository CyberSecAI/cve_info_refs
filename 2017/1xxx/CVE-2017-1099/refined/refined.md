Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The IBM Jazz Foundation exposes sensitive information through stack trace error conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Exposure: The vulnerability lies in the application's handling of errors, where stack traces may reveal internal application details to authenticated users, which is not intended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information. This information could include details about the application's internal workings, file paths, or other data that an attacker could use to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application itself, where errors trigger the stack traces which are then presented to the user. This typically involves activities that result in errors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. No specific capabilities are specified beyond this. The user must perform actions that will generate errors resulting in stack traces.
