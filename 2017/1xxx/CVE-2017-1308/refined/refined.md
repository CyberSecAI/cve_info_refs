- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access controls allow an authenticated attacker to download files they should not have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access control mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access and download of files.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker can exploit the improper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system.
