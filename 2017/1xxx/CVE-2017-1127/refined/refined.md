- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This could potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session by altering the intended functionality of the web UI.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a user embedding malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI of the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious user needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields in the web UI. The attacker must then induce a different user to interact with the malicious code (e.g., by visiting a page where it is present).
