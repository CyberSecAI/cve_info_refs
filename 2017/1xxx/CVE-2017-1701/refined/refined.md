- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the usage of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm in IBM Rational Team Concert.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is the primary vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The document doesn't specify the exact impact, but it implies the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system and its data.
- **Attack vectors:** The document does not specify any specific attack vectors, it only mentions the use of a weak crypto algorithm.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not specify any specific attacker capabilities or position, but it can be assumed that the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is able to send requests to the vulnerable software component.
