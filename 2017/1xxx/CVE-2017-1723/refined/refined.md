- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to QRadar using raw string concatenation to build file paths from user input, which allows for path traversal attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can view arbitrary files on the system by sending a specially-crafted URL request containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially-crafted URL request containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated.
