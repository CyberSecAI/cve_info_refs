**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager, allowing an attacker to manipulate URL requests by inserting directory traversal sequences like "/../".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability
- Insufficient input validation

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a specially crafted URL request containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
