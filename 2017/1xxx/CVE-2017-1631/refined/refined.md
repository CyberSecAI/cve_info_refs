- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The change password functionality in IBM Jazz for Service Management is not protected against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Additionally, the system does not require the user to know their current password when changing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), missing current password check for password change.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute malicious and unauthorized actions by forging a request from a trusted user. Specifically, the attacker could change a user's password without knowing the old one.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by tricking a user into executing a forged request via a link or a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into submitting the forged request in a context where the user is logged in to the vulnerable application.
