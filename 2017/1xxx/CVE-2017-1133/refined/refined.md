**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input within the IBM QRadar SIEM and Incident Forensics web UI, allowing for the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the web UI, which can alter the intended functionality of the application and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. This could result in unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web UI, by injecting malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a user of the application with the ability to embed JavaScript code. The attacker requires a low privilege level. The attacker must also convince a user to interact with the malicious content (user interaction is required).
