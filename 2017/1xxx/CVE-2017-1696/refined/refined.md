- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application passes user-supplied data (from forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) directly to the system shell without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This includes complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (as reflected by CVSS vector).
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated.
