Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the logging of web user passwords in clear text within the service trace of IBM WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** User credentials (passwords) are being written to the service trace log without proper encryption or sanitization, making them accessible in plaintext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An authorized local user can potentially read the plaintext passwords from the service trace logs. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially other sensitive information accessible through those accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the system where WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus is installed.
*   **Log File Access:** An attacker with appropriate local permissions can read the service trace log files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authorized Local User:** The attacker needs to be an authorized local user on the system hosting the vulnerable software. This implies the attacker has the required file system privileges to read log files.

**Summary of Key Points:**

*   The vulnerability is present in IBM WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus.
*   The passwords are leaked in the service trace logs.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by authorized local users with access to the logs.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 4.4.

This information is consistent with what would be expected from a vulnerability related to information disclosure due to cleartext logging.
