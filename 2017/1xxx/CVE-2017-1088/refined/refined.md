- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The kernel does not properly clear the memory of the `kld_file_stat` structure before filling it with data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An information leak vulnerability exists because the kernel structure is allocated on the kernel stack, and when copied to user space, it may contain remnants of previous data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can observe bytes from the kernel stack in user space, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by calling the `kldstat(2)` system call, which takes a userland argument of type `struct kld_file_stat`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code in user space to call the `kldstat(2)` syscall.
