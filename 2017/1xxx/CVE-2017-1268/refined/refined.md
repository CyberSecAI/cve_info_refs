- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of a one-way hash without a salt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the use of unsalted one-way hashing. This is a cryptographic weakness where the same input will always produce the same output, making the hash susceptible to attacks such as rainbow table lookups.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can potentially compromise the security of the system by making it easier to reverse the hashing and obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the unsalted hashing mechanism to potentially reveal sensitive data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to access the hashed data and have knowledge of common hashing algorithms and the lack of a salt.
