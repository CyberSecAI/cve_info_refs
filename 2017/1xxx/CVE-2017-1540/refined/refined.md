- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within the IBM DOORS Web Access (DWA) application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI. This allows them to alter the intended functionality and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is initiated via a crafted input in the web UI of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to embed Javascript code in the web UI. The user would need to convince another user to interact with the malicious payload.
