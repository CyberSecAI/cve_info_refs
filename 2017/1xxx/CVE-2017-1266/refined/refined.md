- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permission assignment for a security-critical resource, allowing unintended actors to read or modify it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Inadequate access control leading to unauthorized access to critical resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Potential for unauthorized modification or disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N), with a low-privileged attacker (PR:L) having the ability to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access (AV:N) and low privileges (PR:L) to perform the attack. The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N) and there is no scope change (S:U).
