- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Applications running in the IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform are vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability in IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain higher privileges within the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but it implies that it could be done through network access (restricting access to internal networks can reduce the risk)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have some level of access to the IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform, whether internal or external.
