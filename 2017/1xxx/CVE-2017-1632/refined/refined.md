- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI, potentially leading to alteration of intended functionality and disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript into the web UI, likely through user-provided input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to interact with the vulnerable web UI and inject malicious script. User interaction is required for the exploit to execute in the victim's browser. The attacker also requires a valid session.
