- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When logging is enabled in Daeja ViewONE, the user's current session ID can be written to log files or standard output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Disclosure of sensitive information (user's session ID) to a local user.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A local user could gain access to sensitive session information by viewing the log files.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system where Daeja ViewONE is installed and where logging is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user access to the system is required.
