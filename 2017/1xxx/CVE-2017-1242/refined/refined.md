- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows a remote attacker to inject malicious HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is HTML injection, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the victim's browser, in the security context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, requiring network access. The attacker injects malicious HTML code into the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious code into the application and trick a user into viewing it. This usually requires some form of authentication/authorization. The attacker needs to have low level privileges within the application to inject malicious HTML. The user then needs to view the injected content.
