  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering the intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web UI of IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation (DNG/RRC).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires the ability to embed JavaScript code in the Web UI. The CVSS vector suggests that a low-privileged user with user interaction is required for exploitation."
