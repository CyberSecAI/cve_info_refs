- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) Client and IBM Spectrum Protect for Virtual Environments (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments): Data Protection for VMware may display the obfuscated VMware vCenter userID and password during VM related operations in the application trace output when application tracing is enabled with the GENERAL trace flag. The credentials are not encrypted in the trace output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Disclosure of sensitive information (VMware vCenter username and password) in application trace output.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user with access to the trace output could obtain the credentials for the VMware vCenter.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system where the IBM Spectrum Protect client or Data Protection for VMware component is installed and has application tracing enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to read the application trace output file which is generated when application tracing is enabled. The application tracing is not enabled by default and is usually only turned on for troubleshooting at the direction of IBM Support.
