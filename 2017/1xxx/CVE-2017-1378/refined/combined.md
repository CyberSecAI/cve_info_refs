# Security Bulletin: vCenter password disclosure via application tracing in IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) Client and IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) Client and IBM Spectrum Protect for Virtual Environments (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments): Data Protection from VMware may display the obfuscated VMware vCenter userID and password during VM related operations in the application trace output when application tracing is enabled with the GENERAL trace flag. This problem only manifests when the IBM Spectrum Protect (Tivoli Storage Manager) Client is used as the IBM Spectrum Protect (Tivoli Storage Manager) for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware data mover.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1378](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1378)IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) disclosed unencrypted login credentials to Vmware vCenter in the application trace output which could be obtained by a local user.

CVSS Base Score: 5.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126875> for the current score
