- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could lead to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or the disclosure of sensitive information, potentially including credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI, where users can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the application with the ability to input data that is not properly sanitized. The attacker must also convince another user to interact with the injected malicious script.
