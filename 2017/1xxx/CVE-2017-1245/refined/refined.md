- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the web UI, allowing users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the web UI of the application. This can lead to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session and alteration of the intended functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user injects JavaScript code into the web UI of the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a user account with the ability to input data into the web UI. User interaction is required to trigger the execution of the injected script.
