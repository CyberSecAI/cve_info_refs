- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the server-side components of IBM Daeja ViewONE not setting a character set in the mime-type and not including the X-Content-Type-Options=nosniff header in responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the web UI. This requires a user to be tricked into interacting with the malicious code (UI:R), or via another vulnerability.
