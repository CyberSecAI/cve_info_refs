Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the Web UI of the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the web interface, enabling XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI.
* **Altered Functionality:** This injected script can modify the intended behavior of the web application.
* **Potential Credential Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially steal user credentials within a trusted session by intercepting or redirecting requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Web UI:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
* **Malicious Input:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by injecting crafted malicious JavaScript code through the UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Low Privileges:** Attackers need only low-level privileges to inject the malicious code.
* **User Interaction:** While the attacker must inject the code, the victim must also interact with the affected web interface for the malicious script to be executed.
