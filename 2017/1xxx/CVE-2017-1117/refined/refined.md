- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability is related to how IBM MQ handles trace enablement for the MQXR channel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A denial of service vulnerability exists when trace is enabled on the MQXR channel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can cause a denial of service to the MQXR channel.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user via network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of IBM MQ and needs to be able to trigger trace enablement on the MQXR channel.
