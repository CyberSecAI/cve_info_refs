- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing "secure" attribute in the encrypted session (SSL) cookie.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The absence of the "secure" attribute in the SSL cookie allows the cookie to be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections. This can expose the session ID to interception.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who intercepts the session ID can potentially hijack user sessions, leading to unauthorized access or actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves network-based attacks where an attacker intercepts the cookie during its transmission, especially if the user accesses the application over an unencrypted HTTP connection or if a network device allows the downgrade of HTTPS connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the server, such as an attacker on the same network or in a privileged position within the network.
