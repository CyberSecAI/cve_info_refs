- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Storwize V7000 Unified product used the Arcfour encryption algorithm for client-to-server communications which is considered weak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially decrypt highly sensitive information due to the weak encryption.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, as it involves client-to-server communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between a client and the IBM Storwize V7000 Unified server, and knowledge to exploit the weak encryption.
