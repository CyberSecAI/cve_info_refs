- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL statements into the application's database queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could view, add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, by sending specially crafted SQL statements to the vulnerable IBM Security Guardium instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
