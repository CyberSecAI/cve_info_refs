- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) Unix Clients may use a symbolic link to provide non-privileged users access to files that require root privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper use of symbolic links leading to unauthorized file access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Non-privileged users can gain access to files that should be restricted to root users. This could lead to information disclosure, data modification, or other forms of unauthorized access depending on the nature of the protected files.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation relies on the client's use of symbolic links. The exact mechanism of how these links are created/used is not detailed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be a non-privileged user on a system running a vulnerable version of the IBM Spectrum Protect Client. They would need to be able to access or manipulate the symbolic links being used by the client.
