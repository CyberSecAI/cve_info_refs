- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM DWA (DOORS Web Access) stores credentials, and an attacker with physical access can use these to log into the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure storage of user credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with physical access can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application, potentially leading to data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the machine where the application is running.
