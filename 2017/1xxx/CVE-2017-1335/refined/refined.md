Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-1335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering it in the web UI.
- This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's session.
- Potential for credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- Altering the intended functionality of the web UI.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the web UI where the malicious code was injected.
- Attackers can exploit this by embedding malicious JavaScript code through some input mechanism, which is then rendered by the web UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to inject JavaScript code into the web UI. This usually involves having some level of access to the system to insert the malicious payload.
- The attacker can achieve this through various means, such as user input fields or other injection points within the web interface.
- The attacker relies on a victim user visiting or interacting with the affected parts of the application where the malicious script is rendered.

**Additional Details:**
- The document states that multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist in IBM RELM (CVE-2017-1324, CVE-2017-1334, CVE-2017-1335, CVE-2017-1359, CVE-2017-1364, CVE-2017-1369, and CVE-2017-1429) with the same description and CVSS score.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 with a vector of (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
