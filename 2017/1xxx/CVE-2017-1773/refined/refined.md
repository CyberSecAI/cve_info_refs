- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM DataPower Gateway reuses the source port in DNS lookups.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reuse of source port makes it easier for attackers to predict the port number used in DNS queries, leading to DNS cache poisoning.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques can spoof DNS responses, perform DNS cache poisoning, and redirect Internet traffic.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, where the attacker intercepts and modifies network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the DataPower Gateway and the DNS server.
