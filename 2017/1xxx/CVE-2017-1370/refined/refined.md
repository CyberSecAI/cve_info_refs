Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how the Report Builder, within IBM Jazz Reporting Service (JRS), handles error messages on its administrator configuration page. Specifically, sensitive information, including user credentials, can be disclosed through these error messages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information (user credentials) through error messages. This suggests insufficient sanitization or filtering of error outputs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of user credentials, which an attacker could use to gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves accessing the Report Builder's administrator configuration page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to access the Report Builder's administrator configuration page. While the specific authentication requirements are not detailed, the CVSS vector indicates that the attacker would need high privileges on the system (`PR:H`).

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists in IBM Jazz Reporting Service (JRS) Report Builder, where sensitive information including user credentials can be exposed in error messages on the administrator configuration page. This vulnerability can be exploited by a high privilege attacker to gain access to credentials.
