- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Process Center Console is vulnerable to a persisted Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user input, allowing attackers to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web application, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web UI, specifically by embedding malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to interact with the web UI of IBM Business Process Manager and inject malicious script. The attacker needs to have the privilege to make changes to the system that can lead to the execution of the malicious script by another user. This is indicated by the CVSS vector "PR:L" which means "Low privileges" are required. The "UI:R" component means that user interaction is needed.
