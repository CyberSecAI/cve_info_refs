- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The IBM Jazz Foundation is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The embedded JavaScript code can alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript into the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI. This likely requires a low level of access, such as a user with the ability to input data into web UI fields.
