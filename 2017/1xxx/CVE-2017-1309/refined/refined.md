- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Reference Data Management Hub stores user credentials in plain text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User passwords are stored in plain text instead of using encryption or hashing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user who has access to the system where the application is installed can read the stored user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Reference Data Management Hub is installed and must have sufficient privileges to access the file where user credentials are stored in plain text.
