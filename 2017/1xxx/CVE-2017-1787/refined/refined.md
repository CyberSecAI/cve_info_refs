- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a hard-coded password within the IBM Rational Publishing Engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded credentials
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user with administrative privileges can obtain hard-coded user credentials. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially escalating privileges or performing other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally by a user who already has administrative privileges on the system where the affected software is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with administrative privileges on the machine where the affected IBM Rational Publishing Engine is installed.
