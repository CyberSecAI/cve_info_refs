{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The user-space stack is automatically expanded by the kernel. If another memory region is mapped directly below the stack, the stack pointer can move into the other memory region without raising a page fault. A guard-page is used to prevent this, but it is not always implemented or sized correctly, and there exist techniques to bypass it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient size of stack guard-page",
    "Vulnerabilities in stack guard-page implementations",
    "Bypass of stack guard-page protection through 'jumping' techniques",
    "Fragile stack expansion mechanism",
    "Lack of checks for stack-pointer movement",
    "Improper recursive qsort",
        "Incorrect handling of RLIMIT_STACK",
    "Incorrect protection based on pathname of SUID binaries",
    "Improper mapping of ld.so near stack",
    "Incorrect memory protection settings when increasing stack limit",
        "Insufficient checks for stack guard-page during mmap operations"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root, arbitrary code execution, control of instruction pointer, bypassing ASLR and NX protections, arbitrary file overwriting, denial of service, heap corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Clashing stack with other memory regions (heap, mmap, ld.so, PIE)",
    "Jumping over the stack guard-page using stack-based buffers or specific library functions like gettext, vfprintf, getaddrinfo",
    "Exploiting recursive function calls (qsort)",
    "Manipulating environment variables (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LANGUAGE, OUTPUT_CHARSET, LD_AUDIT)",
    "Using command-line arguments and environment variables to allocate large stack memory",
    "Exploiting vulnerabilities in dynamic linkers (ld.so)",
        "Using symlinks to bypass restrictions and race conditions",
    "Manipulating resource limits (RLIMIT_STACK)"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access on the target system to execute code and create/modify files and directories. Some exploits also allow remote exploitation through specific services. For some attacks, the attacker must have the ability to specify arguments to a program execution, modify environment variables, and execute commands.  Some attacks bypass privilege separation such as SELinux restrictions."
