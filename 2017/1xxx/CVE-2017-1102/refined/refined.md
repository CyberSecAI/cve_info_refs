- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist. The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to alter the intended functionality of the Web UI. This can lead to credential disclosure within a trusted session, potentially compromising user accounts and sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by embedding malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to embed JavaScript code within the application's Web UI. The attacker also needs to trick a user into interacting with the malicious input.
