- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks due to insufficient input validation of URL parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTTP response splitting
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the server to return a split response, by using a specially crafted URL.
    - Allows further attacks like Web cache poisoning, cross-site scripting, and potentially obtaining sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL to the vulnerable server. When the URL is clicked, it causes the server to return a split HTTP response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send crafted URLs to the server and needs a user to click on them.
