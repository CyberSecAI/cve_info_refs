- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Identity Adapters, by default, do not encrypt data traffic to and from the IGI and ISIM servers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of encryption for data in transit.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unencrypted data transmission could expose sensitive information during transit.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and view unencrypted data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to intercept the traffic between the adapter and the server.
