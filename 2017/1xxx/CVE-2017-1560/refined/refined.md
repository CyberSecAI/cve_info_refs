The provided content contains information about CVE-2017-1560.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in IBM DOORS Next Generation (DNG/RRC).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the web UI. This could lead to altered functionality and potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web UI where a user can inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to embed JavaScript code within the web interface. This often requires a user to interact with the malicious code via the UI. The CVSS vector indicates that low privileges are required and user interaction is also required, meaning that an attacker must be able to either manipulate the code entered by a low privileged user, or have a user directly interact with the malicious payload.
