- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper handling of user input in IBM Doors Web Access, allowing an attacker to inject code that can hijack the victim's clicks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Clickjacking vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can hijack the victim's click actions, potentially leading to further attacks against the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can persuade a victim to visit a malicious website, which then exploits the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to persuade a victim to visit a malicious website. The attacker doesn't require any specific access level to the application.
