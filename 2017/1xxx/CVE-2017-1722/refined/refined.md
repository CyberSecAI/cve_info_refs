- **Root cause of vulnerability**: QRadar used an insecure method for generating SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could send specially-crafted SQL statements to view, add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker sending specially-crafted SQL statements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with the ability to send SQL statements to the vulnerable application. They require low privileges on the system to perform the injection.
