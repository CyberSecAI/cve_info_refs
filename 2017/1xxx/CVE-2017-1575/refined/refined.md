- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs local access to the system.
