- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unspecified vulnerability exists in the Lifecycle Query Engine (LQE) of Jazz Reporting Service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for the potential disclosure of highly sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), and requires a low privileged user(PR:L) to initiate the exploit. The attack complexity is high (AC:H) and there is no user interaction required (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit this vulnerability over the network.
