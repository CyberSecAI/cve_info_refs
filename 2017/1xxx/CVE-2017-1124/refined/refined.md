Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an HTTP Header Injection issue in IBM Maximo Asset Management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- HTTP Header Injection: The application improperly handles or sanitizes input used to construct HTTP headers, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data into the header fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: A local attacker could potentially obtain sensitive data by manipulating HTTP headers. The specific nature of the information is not detailed in this document.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access:  The vulnerability is described as exploitable by a "local attacker," meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system where IBM Maximo Asset Management is deployed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the server hosting the vulnerable IBM Maximo Asset Management instance
- Ability to manipulate or inject data into HTTP header fields.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CVSS vector string (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) indicates:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** Exploitation requires a high level of effort or specific conditions to be met.
    *   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No specific privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required for exploitation.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the component.
    *  **C:L (Confidentiality: Low):** There is limited impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (Integrity: None):** There is no impact on integrity.
    *   **A:N (Availability: None):** There is no impact on availability.
* The vulnerability impacts multiple versions of IBM Maximo Asset Management core product, and all other IBM Maximo Industry Solution and IBM Control Desk products that are installed on top of an affected IBM Maximo Asset Management.
*   The document provides links to download patches for various affected versions.
