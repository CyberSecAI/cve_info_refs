- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Security Guardium processes patches, image backups, and other updates without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of the code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper verification of the origin and integrity of code updates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the installation of malicious code via updates, which could potentially compromise the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks using a malicious update.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to provide a malicious update that would be accepted by the system without proper integrity verification. This would likely be someone with network access to the IBM Security Guardium instance.
