- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sending a specially crafted message to an SDR or CLUSSDR channel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the handling of specially crafted messages by SDR or CLUSSDR channels, which can cause them to remain in a running state but not process messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service condition where affected channels stop processing messages.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending a specially crafted message to an affected channel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with the authority to send messages to the SDR or CLUSSDR channel.
