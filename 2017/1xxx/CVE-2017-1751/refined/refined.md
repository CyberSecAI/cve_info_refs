- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Robotic Process Automation with Automation Anywhere Web UI allows embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality. This could lead to disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the Web UI of the IBM RPA with Automation Anywhere application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI which implies a user interaction is needed (UI:R) but no prior privileges (PR:N).
