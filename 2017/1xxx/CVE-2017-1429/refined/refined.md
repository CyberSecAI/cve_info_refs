The provided content is related to CVE-2017-1429.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM) web interface, which allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code into the web UI. This can alter the intended functionality of the application and potentially lead to the disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of the IBM RELM application. By injecting malicious JavaScript code, attackers can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected parts of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
A user with the ability to interact with the web interface and inject JavaScript code is required. The attacker needs to have a low level of privileges (PR:L) but needs to trick a user to trigger the injected payload (UI:R).
