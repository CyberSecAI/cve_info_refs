- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper distinction between internal group memberships and user registry group memberships during synchronization between the user registry and the IBM BPM database. Specifically, if a group with the same name exists in both the IBM BPM database and the user registry, invalid memberships can occur.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The primary weakness is the failure to properly distinguish between internal group memberships and those from the user registry. This can lead to a user gaining membership in an internal group that they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By manipulating LDAP group membership, an attacker could gain privileged access that they would not normally have, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves manipulating LDAP group memberships. This suggests an attacker would need to be able to modify group memberships in the user registry (likely an LDAP server) that IBM BPM uses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to modify group memberships in the LDAP (or user registry), and have an account with low-privilege in IBM BPM.
