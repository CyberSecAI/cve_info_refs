- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from IBM Security Guardium not sufficiently proving that the actor's identity is correct.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This can lead to the exposure of resources or functionality to unintended actors. The impact is rated as high in terms of confidentiality (C:H), with no impact on integrity or availability (I:N/A:N) according to CVSS vector.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based attack (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), and no user interaction needed (UI:N). The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network without requiring any prior authentication or user interaction.
