# Security Bulletin: Information disclosure in WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2017-1381)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is an information disclosure in the WebSphere Application Server Proxy Server or On-Demand-Router (ODR). This only occurs when the system clock is changed. If the system clock is changed it could cause stale data to be cached and served.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1381](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1381) IBM WebSphere Application Server Proxy Server or On-demand-router (ODR) could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by stale data being cached and then served.

CVSS Base Score: 2.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127152> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability affects the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional:

* Version 9.0 - you are only affected if you have changed the default value for the custom property cache.query.string to false
* Version 8.5
* Version 8.0
* Version 7.0

## Remediation/Fixes

This vulnerability **only** occurs if you change the system clock.

The recommended solution is to apply the interim fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI82630 for each named product as soon as practical. **For WebSphere Application Server traditional and WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition:**  **For V9.0.0.0 through 9.0.0.4:**

· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PI82630](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043870)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 9.0.0.5 or later. **For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.12:**

· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PI82630](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043870)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.13 or later.

**For V8.0.0.0 through 8.0.0.13:**

· Upgrade to a minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PI82630](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043870)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 8.0.0.14 or later.

**For V7.0.0.0 through 7.0.0.43:**

· Upgrade to a minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PI82630](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043870)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 7.0.0.45 or later.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

There are several ways to work around this issue. You only need to do **one** of these **or** apply the Interim fix above.

1) Restart the ODR or proxy server after changing the system clock.

2) If your applications do not require response caching then disable caching and restart the ODR or proxy server prior to changing the system clock.   <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/ujpx_proxy.html>

3) Set the custom property cache.query.string to true and restart the ODR or proxy server prior to changing the system clock.  This is already set to true in Version 9.   <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/rjpx_siphttpcustprops.html#cache.query.string>

4) Clear the ODR or proxy server cache prior to changing the system clock. <https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/382562/how-do-i-clear-the-websphere-proxy-server-or-odr-c.html>

5) In the application, set the "Cache-Control: no-cache" directive header in the response to prevent sensitive content from being cached in the proxy server or ODR.
