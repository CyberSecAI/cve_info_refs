- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within IBM Security Guardium, allowing a remote authenticated attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote authenticated attacker can send a specially-crafted request to the affected system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the affected IBM Security Guardium system and be able to send requests to it.
