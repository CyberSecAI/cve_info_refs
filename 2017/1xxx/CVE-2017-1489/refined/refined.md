- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in IBM Security Access Manager e-community configurations, specifically with ECSSO Master Authentication. This allows a redirect to a server not participating in the e-community domain.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An improper redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to an unauthorized redirect, potentially to a malicious server or a location not intended by the user or administrator. This could lead to information exposure or phishing attempts.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the ECSSO Master Authentication mechanism. The attack vector is local with a user interaction required to trigger the redirect.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would likely need to induce a user to interact with a vulnerable system through a crafted link or similar attack.
