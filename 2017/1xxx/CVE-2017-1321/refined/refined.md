- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input in IBM InfoSphere Information Server Framework.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting web site. This can lead to stealing the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials, altering intended functionality of the application, and potentially disclosing credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code that is executed when a victim clicks the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. No specific user privileges are required.
