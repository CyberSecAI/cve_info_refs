- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar SIEM product writes potentially sensitive information to log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure through log files that could be read by a local user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, which could give valuable guidance to the attacker. This could include sensitive user information.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user with access to the log files.
