- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute unauthorized actions on the IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager via a trusted user's browser. This includes modifying data and potentially disrupting services.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could leverage malicious links or embedded scripts on a webpage that a victim user accesses. When the user's authenticated session interacts with the malicious content, a CSRF attack is initiated, causing the user to perform unintended actions against the target application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce an authenticated user of the affected system to interact with malicious content, typically by tricking the user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious webpage while the user has an active session on the target.
