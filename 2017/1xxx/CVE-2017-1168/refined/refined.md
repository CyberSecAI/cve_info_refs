- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM) Web UI, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session. This could result in the disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session and potentially other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the RELM Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to embed JavaScript code into the Web UI, and a victim needs to interact with the malicious code through the application.  The attacker requires low privileges and the user needs to be tricked into triggering the malicious code.
