- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM MQ Java/JMS applications incorrectly transmit passwords in plain text when `PASSWORDPROTECTION=ALWAYS` is set in the `mqclient.ini` configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way the IBM MQ Java/JMS client handles password protection when the `PASSWORDPROTECTION=ALWAYS` configuration option is enabled. Instead of encrypting the password, it is transmitted in plain text.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker who can intercept the network traffic where the IBM MQ Java/JMS application is transmitting data could obtain the password in clear text.
- **Attack vectors:** Network interception of the traffic between the IBM MQ client and server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to eavesdrop on the network traffic between the client and server.
