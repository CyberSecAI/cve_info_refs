- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The rename operation of a table does not update the user authorization cache.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect privilege assignment on a table. Specifically, after a table is renamed and a new table with the same name as the original is created, users who had access to the old table might maintain access on the new table even though it should not be inherited.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to data in the new table, which could lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with privileges on a table that is then renamed could exploit this issue by observing their privileges on a new table created with the original name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have existing privileges on a table and the ability to observe privileges granted on the new table after a rename operation.
