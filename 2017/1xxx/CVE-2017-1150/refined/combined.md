# Security Bulletin: Information Disclosure vulnerability affects IBM® DB2® LUW (CVE-2017-1150)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

When a table is renamed and a new table is created with the old name, users who had access on the old table may be able to access the new table.

## Vulnerability Details

A user may incorrectly acquire privileges on a table if the table is created with the same name as a previously renamed table. During a RENAME TABLE, a user maintains privileges on the renamed table. However, if a new table is then created with the old name, the user may also incorrectly maintain their privileges on this new table. The problem is caused by the rename operation not updating the user authorization cache. The error will be cleared up when the database is deactivated or when the DB2 instance is restarted.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

**Workaround #1**

Recycling the database:

* db2stop
* db2start

**Workaround #2**

1. Create a new table with the old table name.

For each affected grantee:

1. Grant the privilege(s) held by the grantee on the old table.
2. Revoke the granted privilege(s) from step a.
3. Drop the table created on step 1 (if not needed anymore).

**Workaround #3**

Revoke all the privileges from other grantees prior to the RENAME TABLE and re-grant the privileges to the grantees on the newly named table.
