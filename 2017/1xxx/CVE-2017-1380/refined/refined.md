- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the Admin Console for WebSphere Application Server. This allows for the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session when they are using the Admin Console. This could lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the Web UI.
    - Potential credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI of the Admin Console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI. This likely involves a user with lower privileges in the application. A user needs to be tricked into executing the malicious code.
