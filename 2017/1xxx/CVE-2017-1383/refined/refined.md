- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML data, specifically a failure to restrict XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending maliciously crafted XML data to the affected application during the processing of XML data. This includes the import of DataStage assets, use of Intelligent Assistants, and XML metadata imports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send a malicious XML document to the application. The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and does not need any user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
