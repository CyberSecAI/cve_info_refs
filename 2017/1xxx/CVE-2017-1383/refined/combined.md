# Security Bulletin: IBM InfoSphere Information Server is potentially vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

An XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Information Server potentially can be used by an attacker to retrieve sensitive documents.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1383](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1383)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM InfoSphere Information Server is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources.

CVSS Base Score: 7.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127155> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

## Affected Products and Versions

The following products, running on all supported platforms, are affected:

IBM InfoSphere DataStage: versions 9.1, 11.3, 11.5 and 11.7

IBM InfoSphere Information Server on Cloud: version 11.5

## Remediation/Fixes

For DataStage import operations:

| 9.1 | [JR57932](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR57932 "JR62268") | --Upgrade to a release where this issue is addressed. |

For other components and releases, see the Workarounds and Mitigations section.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

**Mitigation Steps:**

DataStage import operations

Note: See Remediation/Fixes section for available fixes.

For releases other than 11.7, if a published fix is not applied:

• Limit import of DataStage assets to DSX (Default) or ISX formats, only.

• If XML format is used for import, manually check the XML file before importing the file to determine if there is a DTD / DOCTYPE section. DTD sections are optional in DataStage XML files, and if present, can be safely removed before importing.

• Additionally, use the istools command line utility that supports both export and import in ISX format.

**Examples on the use of istools command line utility can be found in the links below:**

DataStage Intelligent Assistants

Intelligent assistant functionality is described here:

<https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZJPZ_11.5.0/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.ds.design.doc/topics/c_ddesref_Intelligent_Assistants.html>

The section "Creating a template from a job" explains where Templates are stored. The default location is Clients\Classic\Assistants\Generation\templates\<language>.

Before using a Template, manually check the underlying XML file before importing the file to determine if there is a DTD / DOCTYPE section. DTD sections are not required in Template XML files, and if present, can be safely removed before using.

Legacy tool XMLImporter.exe

The tool XMLImporter.exe can be found in the Clients\Classic directory.

As installed, it cannot be used, but can be made to work with sufficient internals knowledge.

It serves no useful function and should be deleted from systems.

**Important:** There are several similarly named executables which are not subject to this security bulletin. Please ensure to only delete the executable named XMLImporter.exe.

XML Metadata importer operations for XML Input and XML Output plugin stages

XML Metadata Importer is used to create table definitions from XML sources i.e. XML Schemas and XML documents. IBM recommends manually checking the XML file content before importing the file. If there is a DTD / DOCTYPE section, verify its contents for any vulnerabilities.

DTD sections are required in some XML files else the metadata imported may be incomplete which could be due to missing DTD Entities data.

XML Schema Definition (XSD) language is the current standard schema language for all XML documents and data. So, IBM recommends using XSD as an alternative to DTD.
