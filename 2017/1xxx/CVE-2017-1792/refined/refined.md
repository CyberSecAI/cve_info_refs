- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Quality Manager (RQM) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting due to insufficient input sanitization/validation, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the web UI, potentially altering its intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the web UI by injecting malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to embed JavaScript code into the Web UI. The attacker also needs to convince another user to interact with the malicious content.
