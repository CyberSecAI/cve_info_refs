- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the DataPower system log, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the DataPower system log.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI, potentially leading to modification of intended functionality or disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through the DataPower Web UI by injecting malicious javascript into system logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to influence the system logs to include malicious javascript code. A user with access to the Web UI is required to view the logs for the attack to be successful.
