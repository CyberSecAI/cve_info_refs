- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms, which could lead to unauthorized decryption of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attack (AV:N) with High attack complexity (AC:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to perform the attack over the network, and needs sophisticated skills/effort to perform the attack. No privileges or user interaction is required (PR:N/UI:N).
