- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The optional Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection feature, which uses Referer header allow listing, is ineffective. The check is skipped.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Ineffective CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user if the CSRF protection is not properly implemented.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a cross-site request forgery attack, where a malicious website or email could trick a user's browser into sending requests to the vulnerable IBM BPM application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a user into making a request to the vulnerable server. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious webpage or sending an email with malicious links.
