- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Streams uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms when Transport Layer Security (TLS) is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of weak ciphers for encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information due to the weak cryptographic algorithms used.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to have any special privileges (PR:N) or require user interaction (UI:N) but exploiting this vulnerability has a high complexity (AC:H)
