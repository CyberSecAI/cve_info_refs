- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation allowing directory traversal through specially crafted URL requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can view arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a specially-crafted URL request containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
