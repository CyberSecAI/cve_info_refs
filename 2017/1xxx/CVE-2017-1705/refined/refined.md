- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by leftover sensitive information present in page comments within IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager. This information is not visible on the rendered page but can be accessed by viewing the page source code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is the presence of sensitive information in HTML comments which are accessible by viewing the page source code. This constitutes a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by viewing the page source code. This is classified as low impact in terms of confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would need to access the affected application via the network to view the page source code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the application's web interface (requires network access) and must be able to view the source code of the web pages (requires basic browser knowledge). The attacker must be a low-privileged user, as the CVSS vector indicates the attacker requires 'PR:L' (Low Privileges).
