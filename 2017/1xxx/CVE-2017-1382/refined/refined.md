- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Custom startup scripts for WebSphere Application Server do not inherit the umask setting from server.xml, leading to files being created with default permissions instead of the customized ones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file permissions resulting from custom startup scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could gain access to files, with the full impact being unknown. The vulnerability could potentially allow unauthorized access or modification of sensitive information within the server environment.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. The attacker must be able to interact with the server's file system, gaining access to log files or other files that have incorrect permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to access the file system.
