- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the IBM Sterling File Gateway allowing an unauthorized user to view files they should not have access to, if they know the directory location of the file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure. The system does not properly restrict access to files, allowing unauthorized users to view files given they know the directory location.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain access to sensitive information by viewing files they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker who knows the directory location of files can access them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to know the directory location of the files they want to access and be able to send requests to the vulnerable system over the network.
