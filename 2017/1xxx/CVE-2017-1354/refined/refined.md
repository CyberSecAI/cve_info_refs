- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI. This could lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the application.
    - Disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
    - Stealing or manipulating customer session cookies, potentially leading to impersonation of a legitimate user.
    - Viewing or altering user records.
    - Performing transactions as that user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by embedding arbitrary JavaScript code into the web interface, likely via user supplied input that isn't properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the Web UI, which implies a low-privileged user access to the application is sufficient. The UI interaction will cause the malicious code to be executed in a victim user's session.
