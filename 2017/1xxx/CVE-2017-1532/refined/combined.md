## Affected Products and Versions

Rational DOORS: 9.5.0.0 - 9.5.0.7, 9.5.1.0 - 9.5.1.8, 9.5.2.0 - 9.5.2.7, 9.6.0.0 - 9.6.0.6, 9.6.1.0 - 9.6.1.9

The following Rational DOORS components are affected:

* Rational DOORS desktop client
* Rational DOORS Web Access
* Rational DOORS interoperation server

## Remediation/Fixes

Upgrade to the fix pack that corresponds to the version of Rational DOORS that you are running, as shown in the following table. Upgrade the Rational DOORS client, the Rational DOORS database server, and the Rational DOORS interoperation server.

NOTE: You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues.

| **Rational DOORS version** | **Upgrade to fix pack** |
| --- | --- |
| 9.5 9.5.0.1 - 9.5.0.7 | [9.5.0.8](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044489) |
| 9.5.1 9.5.1.1 - 9.5.1.8 | [9.5.1.9](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044490) |
| 9.5.2 9.5.2.1 - 9.5.2.7 | [9.5.2.8](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044491) |
| 9.6.0 9.6.0.1 - 9.6.0.6 | [9.6.0.7](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044492) |
| 9.6.1 9.6.1.1 - 9.6.1.9 | [9.6.1.10](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044327) |

*For* *Rational DOORS version 9.4.x and earlier, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.*

If you are using Rational DOORS Web Access, after you upgrade, but before you start the Rational DOORS Web Access server, edit the core configuration file and set the required version of the interoperation server to the version of the fix pack upgrade, as described in the following steps.

**Procedure:**

1. To edit the Rational DOORS Web Access core configuration file, open the festival.xml file, which is in the server\festival\config directory.
2. Add the following line in the <f:properties> section:

   <**f:property name="interop.version" value="9.n.n.n"**Â />

   Replace "9.n.n.n" with the version of the fix pack upgrade: 9.5.0.8, 9.5.1.9, 9.5.2.8, 9.6.0.7, or 9.6.1.10.
3. Save and close the file.

After this revision, only the specified version of the interoperation server can access the Rational DOORS database.
