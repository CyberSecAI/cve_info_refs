- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM DOORS Web UI, which allows embedding of arbitrary Javascript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Javascript code into the Web UI. This can lead to altering the intended functionality and potentially lead to disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through the web interface. A user with the ability to embed Javascript code in the Web UI can execute arbitrary code in the context of another user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to embed Javascript in the web interface and needs a victim to interact with the malicious code in the web browser.
