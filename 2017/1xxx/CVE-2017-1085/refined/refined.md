{
  "CVE-2017-1085": {
    "Root cause": "Incorrect implementation of `setrlimit()` in FreeBSD that allows a program to modify the protection of memory regions below the stack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The `setrlimit()` implementation in `kern_proc_setrlimit()` function incorrectly calculates the size and address of the memory region to be protected.",
       "The function uses `vm_map_protect()` to set the protection of the memory region."
     ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can increase the stack size beyond its initial boundary, leading to the possibility to overwrite memory regions located below the stack.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can execute a program that uses `setrlimit()` with the `RLIMIT_STACK` argument to increase the stack size, causing memory corruption when the stack grows.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to execute code on a vulnerable FreeBSD system."
  }
