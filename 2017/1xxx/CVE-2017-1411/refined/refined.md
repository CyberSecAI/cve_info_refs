- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Security Identity Governance Virtual Appliance does not enforce strong password policies by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of strong password requirements makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially resulting in information disclosure, data manipulation, or further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special capabilities or position are required for exploitation.
