- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in IBM Security Guardium that allows a local attacker with CLI access to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker with CLI access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs CLI access to the vulnerable system.
