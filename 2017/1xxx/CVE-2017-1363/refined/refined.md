- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Team Concert (RTC) web UI, allowing for the embedding of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to the disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI, by injecting malicious Javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to embed JavaScript code in the web UI. The attacker needs to convince a user to execute the injected code by clicking on a malicious link.
