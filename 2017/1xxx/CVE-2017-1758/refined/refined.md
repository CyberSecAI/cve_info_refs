Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the insecure processing of XML data, specifically related to XML External Entity (XXE) injection within the IBM 10x framework, which is used by various IBM products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs when the XML parser processes external entities defined in the XML document. An attacker can exploit this to force the application to access arbitrary resources, disclose internal files, or cause a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially expose sensitive information by forcing the application to read internal files or access internal resources.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By including external entities that reference large or slow-to-access resources, an attacker can exhaust memory or processing resources, leading to a denial of service.
- **Memory Resource Consumption:** A remote attacker can consume memory resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, by sending a specially crafted XML payload to the vulnerable application endpoint.
- **Web Services:** Specifically, the vulnerable code exists in the REST API of affected products or in web services that handle XML payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.
- **Request manipulation:**  The attacker needs the capability to modify XML payloads in web service requests to inject malicious external entities.
- **No Authentication Required (in some cases):**  Some of the bulletins don't specify authentication as a prerequisite, however, one specifically mentions that for some web services, the request needs to be intercepted and modified, implying some level of access.

**Affected products:**
The vulnerability affects multiple IBM products including:
   - IBM Transformation Extender Advanced 9.0
   - IBM Financial Transaction Manager for ACH Services v3.0.2, v3.0.3, v3.0.4, v3.1.0
   - IBM Financial Transaction Manager for Corporate Payment Services v3.0.2
   - IBM Control Center 6.0.0.0 through 6.0.0.2
   - IBM Control Center 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.0.2 iFix01
   - IBM Control Center 6.1.1.0 base release

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability stems from the IBM 10x framework which is utilized by different IBM products.
-  The vulnerability can be exploited by modifying the XML payload to include malicious external entity definitions.
- The CVSS v3 vector for IBM Control Center is `(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)`.

This provides a good overview of the vulnerability and how it impacts various IBM products.
