- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from a weakness in the Administrative Console of IBM WebSphere Application Server, leading to potentially weaker than expected security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The main vulnerability is a weakness in the security mechanisms of the Administrative Console. This allows a remote attacker to potentially bypass security controls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information and gain unauthorized access to the admin console.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, meaning that the attacker does not require local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need network access to the WebSphere Application Server instance and be able to exploit the security weakness in the admin console.
