- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Malformed header data in an MQ message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A corrupt header in an MQ message can cause a server-connection channel process to terminate.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Termination of the server-connection channel process, potentially denying service to other connected clients using the same channel process.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user can insert messages with a corrupt header into the channel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user with the ability to send messages to an IBM MQ channel.
