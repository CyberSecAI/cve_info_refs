- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A privileged user can access sensitive information in the Information Server application memory, which includes access credentials. This can be done by generating a memory dump.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information, specifically access credentials, within application memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A privileged user can gain access to sensitive information, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A privileged user who can trigger or generate a memory dump of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a highly privileged user with the ability to generate application memory dumps.
