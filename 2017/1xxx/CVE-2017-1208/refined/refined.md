- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to alter the intended functionality, steal credentials within a trusted session, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI, where a user can inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the web UI, often through a user input field or other means. The attacker needs to be in a position where they can influence user interactions with the application. The user needs to interact with the injected code.
