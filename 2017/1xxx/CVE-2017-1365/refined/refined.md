- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within the web UI. This can lead to altering the intended functionality of the application, and potentially lead to disclosure of credentials within a trusted user session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's input fields or parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L), and must induce a user to interact with the malicious payload (UI:R). The attack requires network access (AV:N).
