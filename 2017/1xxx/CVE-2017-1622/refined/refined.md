- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application framework within IBM QRadar SIEM does not properly validate certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to spoof a trusted entity. This could lead to the software connecting to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted source.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic and manipulate connections between the vulnerable software and a trusted host.
