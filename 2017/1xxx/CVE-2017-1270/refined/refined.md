- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Security Guardium does not renew a session variable after successful authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session fixation/hijacking vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially force a user to use a known cookie, which can lead to session hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could hijack a user's session by forcing them to use a session cookie known to the attacker.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly stated, but it involves manipulating or controlling the session cookie that the user utilizes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to know or be able to set a user's session cookie before the user successfully authenticates.
