- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A shared memory leak is caused when MQ applications use dynamic queues.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a shared memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The memory leak can lead to a lack of resources for other MQ applications.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by authenticated users using MQ applications with dynamic queues.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM MQ application.
