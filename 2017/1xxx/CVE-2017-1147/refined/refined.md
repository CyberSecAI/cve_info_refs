- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding in the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  XSS reflection vulnerability, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript code injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within the web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript into the web UI, which requires some level of access or the ability to manipulate the input to trigger the XSS.
