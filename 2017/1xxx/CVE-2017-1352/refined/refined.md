- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authenticated user can inject commands into work orders.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The injected commands could be executed by another user who downloads the affected file. This could lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user injects malicious commands into work orders. The commands are then executed when another user downloads the work order file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have an authenticated account on the system, and they must be able to create or modify work orders. The victim must download the affected file containing the injected commands.
