# Security Bulletin: Potential security vulnerability in the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console (CVE-2017-1501)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is a potential security vulnerability in the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console if you have updated the web services security bindings settings. If you changed the cipher suites in the web services security bindings settings they may not have been saved properly and thus be weaker security then you expected. Verify that your settings are what you expect.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1501](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1501) IBM WebSphere Application Server could provide weaker than expected security after using the Admin Console to update the web services security bindings settings.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129576> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability affects the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server:

* Version 9.0
* Version 8.5
* Version 8.0

## Remediation/Fixes

If you have recently changed the cipher suites in the web services security binding settings they may not have been saved properly. This only happened for a few fixpack releases. Verify that your settings are what you expect. If you are using any of the affected fixpack levels 9.0.0.0 - 9.0.0.4, 8.5.5.10, 8.5.5.11 or 8.0.0.13 then the recommended solution is to apply the interim fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI80889 for each named product as soon as practical to ensure the web services security bindings settings will get saved properly in the future.

 **For WebSphere Application Server traditional and WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition:**  **For V9.0.0.0 through 9.0.0.4:**

· Apply Interim Fix [PI80889](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043956)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 9.0.0.5 or later.  **For V8.5.5.10 through 8.5.5.11:**

· Apply Interim Fix [PI80889](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043956)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.12 or later.

**For V8.0.0.13:**

· Apply Interim Fix [PI80889](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043956)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 8.0.0.14 or later.
