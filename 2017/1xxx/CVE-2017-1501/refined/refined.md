- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from an issue in the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console where changes to cipher suites in web services security binding settings are not saved correctly. This can lead to weaker security than intended.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Incorrect saving of cipher suite settings in web services security bindings resulting in weaker security than expected.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The exploitation can lead to weaker security due to the misconfiguration of cipher suites, potentially exposing the system to attacks that would be otherwise mitigated by stronger cryptographic settings.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the configuration weakness caused by incorrect saving of cipher suite settings via the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who can reach the affected system and is aware of the misconfiguration. No specific user privilege is required according to the CVSS vector which has no privilege requirement.
