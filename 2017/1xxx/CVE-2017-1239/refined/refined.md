- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in IBM Quality Manager (RQM) where it could reveal sensitive information in HTTP 500 Internal Server Error responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Information Disclosure. The system inadvertently exposes sensitive information in error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information that should not be revealed, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests that cause an internal server error.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application is required. The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:L) but not user interaction is needed (UI:N).
