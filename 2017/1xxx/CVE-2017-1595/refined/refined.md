- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to unspecified vectors that could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive Information Leakage
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can obtain highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Unspecified vectors. The attacker needs to be local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker is required.
