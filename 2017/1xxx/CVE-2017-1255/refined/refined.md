Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm". This indicates that IBM Security Guardium was using a cryptographic algorithm that is either known to be weak or has known vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The core weakness is the utilization of a flawed or risky cryptographic algorithm. The specific algorithm is not detailed in the provided information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The document doesn't describe the specific impact beyond referencing the CVSS scores. However, the use of broken crypto can lead to a variety of attacks including:
    -  Data Confidentiality Loss:  Sensitive information encrypted with weak algorithms can be decrypted by attackers.
    -  Data Integrity Loss: Weak algorithms could be susceptible to manipulation without detection.
    -  Authentication Bypass: Weak crypto could enable attackers to bypass authentication schemes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The document doesn't provide specific attack vectors. However, in general, vulnerabilities of this nature are usually exploited by intercepting encrypted traffic or data, and then decrypting it using the weakness in the algorithm.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or access the data that is encrypted using the vulnerable algorithm. This may require network access to the system or access to stored data.
- The attacker will also require some level of technical knowledge to exploit cryptographic weaknesses and use the decrypted data

**Additional Notes:**
- The document provides information on affected versions (10.0 - 10.1.4) of IBM Security Guardium and a link to obtain the fix.
- It also acknowledges the IBM X-Force Ethical Hacking Team for discovering the vulnerability.
- The provided links to CVSS v2 and v3 guides and calculators are standard references to evaluate the severity of the vulnerability.
