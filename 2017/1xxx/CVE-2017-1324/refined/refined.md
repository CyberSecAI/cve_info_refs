- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM) web interface, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the web UI.
    - Potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI, where a malicious user can inject JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to embed JavaScript code in the web UI. This could be a low-privileged user depending on the specific vulnerable area. User interaction is required, as specified in the CVSS vector (UI:R).
