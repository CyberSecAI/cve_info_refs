Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
An undisclosed vulnerability in IBM Jazz Team Server and CLM applications allows for some administrative deployment parameters to be exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Vertical Privilege Escalation: A user with lower privileges can potentially gain access to sensitive administrative deployment parameters.
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability results in exposing sensitive administrative deployment parameters to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of the vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive deployment parameters.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to internal configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is accessible over a network (AV:N).
- Low Privileged Access: An attacker with low level privileges is needed to exploit the vulnerability (PR:L)
-  Exploitation is complex (AC:H)
- User interaction is not required (UI:N)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable system.
- Low privileged user access to the system.
