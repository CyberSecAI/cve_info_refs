- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web UI. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user who can input arbitrary code through the web UI, and a victim who is using the application. The attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
