- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Guardium product supports interaction between multiple actors and allows them to negotiate which algorithm should be used for protection mechanisms (such as encryption or authentication). However, it does not select the strongest algorithm available to both parties.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the improper selection of the algorithm used during negotiation, specifically choosing a weaker algorithm instead of the strongest available option.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could potentially lead to weaker protection mechanisms being used, potentially reducing the confidentiality of data or making authentication less secure. The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and no impact on integrity or availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based (AV:N), with a high level of attack complexity (AC:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need privileges or user interaction for successful exploitation (PR:N/UI:N).
