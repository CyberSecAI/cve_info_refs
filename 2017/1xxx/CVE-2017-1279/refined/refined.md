- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in URL requests, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability due to inadequate input validation of URL requests containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can read arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially-crafted URL request containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system and have some knowledge of the directory structure to successfully traverse and retrieve files.
