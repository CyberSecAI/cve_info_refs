# Security Bulletin: Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities affect multiple IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities affect multiple products: Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM) and Rational Software Architect Design Manager (RSA DM).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1422](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1422)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1753)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Team Concert (RTC) is vulnerable to HTML injection. A remote attacker could inject malicious HTML code, which when viewed, would be executed in the victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting site.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135655> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1394](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1394)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM RELM is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138425> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
