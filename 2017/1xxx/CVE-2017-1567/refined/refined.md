- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in IBM DOORS Web Access, which allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This can lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the application.
    - Potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the Web UI.
    - The attacker would need a user to interact with the malicious code (UI:R) within the application for exploitation.
    - The attacker would need to be a user with the "PR:L" privilege.
