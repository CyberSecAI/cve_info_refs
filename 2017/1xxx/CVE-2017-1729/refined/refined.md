- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in IBM Quality Manager (RQM), allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code that, when executed by other users, can alter the intended functionality of the web application. This could lead to credential disclosure within a trusted session, as well as other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI, when a user interacts with the crafted element, the code executes within their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to embed JavaScript code into the Web UI, which likely requires having some level of authenticated access or utilizing a vulnerability that allows injecting arbitrary code into the Web UI. A user interaction is then needed to trigger the vulnerability.
