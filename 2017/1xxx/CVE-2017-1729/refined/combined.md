# Security Bulletin: Multiple Security Vulnerabilities affect IBM速 Rational速 Quality Manager

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM速 Rational速 Quality Manager is vulnerable to multiple security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1396](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1396)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1523](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1523)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Quality Manager (RQM) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/141804> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1549](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1549)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Quality Manager (RQM) is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning, cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
