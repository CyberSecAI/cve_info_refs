- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of proper input sanitization when handling SQL statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can send specially crafted SQL statements, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of information in the back-end database. This includes the ability to view, add, modify, or delete information.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker sends specially crafted SQL statements to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable IBM Security Guardium application. The attacker requires low privileges and no user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
