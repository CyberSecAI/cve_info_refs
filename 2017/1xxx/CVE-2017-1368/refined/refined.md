Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2017-1368:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The IBM Security Identity Governance Virtual Appliance does not set the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of the secure attribute on cookies allows them to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain cookie values by tricking a user into visiting a HTTP link, either directly or through a compromised website.
- By capturing the cookie, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends an HTTP link to the user, or plants this link on a website the user visits.
- The user's browser sends the cookie to the insecure HTTP link.
- The attacker intercepts the traffic and obtains the cookie value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic, or have a position to trick the user to visit a specially crafted http link.
- No specific user privilege is required, only user interaction to click on a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the IBM Security Identity Governance Virtual Appliance.
- The lack of the "secure" attribute on cookies means they will be sent over insecure HTTP connections, increasing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
- The CVSS score is 4.3, indicating a moderate severity.
