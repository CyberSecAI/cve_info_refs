- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated user could generate an API token when not subscribed to the application plan.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper access control, where an authenticated user can bypass subscription requirements to generate API tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to API resources by generating tokens they should not have access to. The impact is considered to have low integrity impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation, specifically by leveraging the API Connect system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials within the API Connect system.
