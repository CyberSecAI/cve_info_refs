# Security Bulletin: Open redirect vulnerability in IBM Business Process Manager (CVE-2017-1159)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Business Process Manager is vulnerable to open redirects, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1159](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1159) IBM Business Process Manager could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim.

CVSS Base Score: 7.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/122891> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

- IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.0.0 through V7.5.1.2

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.0.0 through V8.0.1.3

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.0.0 through V8.5.0.2

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5.0

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.6.0 through V8.5.6.0 CF2

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7.0 through V8.5.7.0 Cumulative Fix 2016.12

Note: A fix for IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix (CF) 2017.03 is available even though IBM BPM V8.5.7 CF 2017.03 is not vulnerable to this security issue. The intention of this interim fix is to prevent the following unnecessary warning message in IBM Installation Manager, which you see when you upgrade IBM BPM:

"One or more fixes will be uninstalled when IBM(R) Business Process Manager <Advanced | Standard | Express> is updated to 8.5.7. CF2017.03. The update does not address issues that were resolved previously by the maintenance packages. The problems might return if fixes for the the following issues are not reapplied or have new fixes applied to prevent the problems from returning.

- JR57478 in the package IBM(R) Business Process Manager <Advanced | Standard | Express> 8.5...

- JR57590 in the package IBM(R) Business Process Manager <Advanced | Standard | Express> 8.5..."

## Remediation/Fixes

Interim fix [JR57478](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR57478) does not fix this vulnerability for releases 8.5.5 and later. Use interim fix [JR58405](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR58405) instead. If [JR57478](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR57478) is already installed, update it to interim fix [JR58405](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR58405).

The recommended solution is to apply the fixes as below:

* [IBM Business Process Manager Advanced](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Advanced&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR57478,JR58405,JR57590)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Standard](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Standard&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR57478,JR58405,JR57590)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Express](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Express&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR57478,JR58405,JR57590)

As IBM Business Process Manager V7.5 is out of general support, customers with a support extension contract can contact IBM support to request the fix.
