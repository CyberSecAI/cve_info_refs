**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user-supplied input, leading to an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Open Redirect: The application does not properly validate the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to control where the user is redirected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Phishing attacks: Attackers can craft malicious links that appear to be legitimate, redirecting users to fake login pages or other malicious websites.
- Credential theft: Users might unknowingly enter their credentials on these fake sites, which the attacker can then steal.
- Further attacks: Attackers can use the redirected site to initiate further attacks against the victim's system, such as drive-by downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers: The attacker can be remote and does not require access to the victim's network.
- Specially-crafted Web sites/URLs: The attacker creates a malicious link that, when clicked, redirects the user to the attacker's controlled server.
- Social Engineering: The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the crafted malicious link.
