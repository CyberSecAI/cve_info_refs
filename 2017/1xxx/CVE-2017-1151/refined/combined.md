## Workarounds and Mitigations

Change the value for the com.ibm.websphere.security.InvokeTAIbeforeSSO custom property to not include the OIDC TAI class name: com.ibm.ws.security.oidc.client.RelyingParty. This property can be updated from the Administrative Console > Global Security > Custom Properties panel. When InvokeTAIbeforeSSO is not enabled for the OIDC TAI class, the timeout for the user login will be that of the LTPA token.

For more information about changing custom properties please refer to the knowledge center: <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/tsec_custprop_del.html>
