- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM WebSphere MQ service trace module could be used to execute untrusted code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for the execution of untrusted code within the context of the 'mqm' user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the system, allowing for unauthorized access, modification, and deletion of data, as well as disruption of services. The CVSS vector indicates high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning that an attacker would need local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system. Low privileges are needed (PR:N), and no user interaction is required (UI:N).
