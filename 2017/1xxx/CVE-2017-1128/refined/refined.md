- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in IBM DOORS Next Generation (DNG/RRC), which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the web application.
    - Disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of IBM DOORS Next Generation (DNG/RRC), where a malicious user can embed JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to input data into the web interface of the affected application. This usually involves having a valid account and the permission to add/modify content that is not properly sanitized. They would also require the victim user to interact with the malicious code on the web UI.
