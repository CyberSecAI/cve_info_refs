Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-1427:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within IBM Cognos Analytics.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the web UI. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
-  The specific location or method of injection is not provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. This could lead to:
    - Altering intended functionality of the application.
    - Disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need to be physically present on the network.
- The attacker must persuade a victim to visit a malicious web page or interact with a malicious link.
-  User interaction (UI) is required as the attack relies on tricking users into executing the injected javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject Javascript into the application.
- The attacker must be able to convince a user to interact with the malicious code (e.g., by visiting a link with malicious javascript embedded in it)
- No special privileges are required, they must be able to send a malicious link to an existing user or trick the user into navigating to a malicious page.
