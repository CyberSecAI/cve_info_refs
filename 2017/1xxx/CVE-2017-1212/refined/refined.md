- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not ensure content is small enough before processing and lacks timeouts for some processes. This can lead to excessive resource consumption when handling large files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation or size limits and missing timeouts for certain processing operations resulting in a denial of service vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause a denial-of-service (DoS), rendering the application unusable due to resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by having a user open or view a large file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a large file to the vulnerable application, which can be achieved remotely through user interaction. The user is required to initiate the action of opening the large file for the attack to occur.
