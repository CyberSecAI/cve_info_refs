- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the web interface of IBM Rhapsody Design Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). The application allows embedding arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web interface, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the application to embed the malicious javascript code. User interaction (clicking on a link with the payload) is required to trigger the vulnerability.
