# Security Bulletin: Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities affect IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Potential Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities affect the following IBM Rational Products: Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM)

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-8975](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8975) IBM Rhapsody DM and IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118912> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1245](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1245) **DESCRIPTION:** IBM Rhapsody Design Manager is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124580> for the current score
