- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTML Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could inject malicious HTML code which would be executed in the victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting site. This could lead to various malicious activities, potentially including credential theft or session hijacking.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker injects malicious HTML code into the web UI of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to input HTML code into the web application, likely requiring some level of access to the application. The user would also need to interact with the malicious code by loading the page, making this a user-interaction attack vector.
