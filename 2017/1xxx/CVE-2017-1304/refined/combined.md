# Security Bulletin: The Elastic Storage Server and the GPFS Storage Server are affected by a vulnerability in IBM Spectrum Scale (CVE-2017-1304)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Use of IBM Spectrum Scale on an Elastic Storage Server/GPFS Storage Server in an unsupported configuration, where user applications are running on an active ESS I/O server node and utilize direct I/O to perform a read or a write to a Spectrum Scale file, may result in a daemon failure, possibly leading to denial of service or undetected data corruption.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-1304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1304) **DESCRIPTION:** IBM has identified a vulnerability with IBM Spectrum Scale/GPFS utilized on the Elastic Storage Server (ESS)/GPFS Storage Server (GSS) during testing of an unsupported configuration, where users applications are running on an active ESS I/O server node and utilize direct I/O to perform a read or a write to a Spectrum Scale file. This vulnerability may result in the use of an incorrect memory address, leading to a Spectrum Scale/GPFS daemon failure with a Signal 11, and possibly leading to denial of service or undetected data corruption.

CVSS Base Score: 6.2

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125458> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

The Elastic Storage Server 5.0 thru 5.0.1

The Elastic Storage Server 4.5 thru 4.6

The Elastic Storage Server 4.0 thru 4.0.6

The Elastic Storage Server 3.5 thru 3.5.6

The Elastic Storage Server 3.0 thru 3.0.5

The Elastic Storage Server 2.5 thru 2.5.5

## Remediation/Fixes

For ESS 5.0 thru 5.0.1, customers should upgrade to ESS 5.0.2

For ESS 4.5 thru 4.6, customers should upgrade to ESS 5.0.2

For ESS 4.0 thru 4.0.6, customers should upgrade to ESS 5.0.2

For ESS 3.5 thru 3.5.6, customers should upgrade to ESS 5.0.2

For ESS 3.0 thru 3.0.5, customers should upgrade to ESS 5.0.2

For ESS 2.5 thru 2.5.5, customers should upgrade to ESS 5.0.2

The ESS 5.0.2 package is available at <https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%20defined%20storage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Elastic+Storage+Server+%28ESS%29&release=5.0.0&platform=All&function=all>

**Notes:**

* If you are unable to upgrade to ESS 5.0.2, please contact IBM Service for an efix referencing APAR IV95041.
* This issue only occurs in an unsupported configuration. Running user applications on an active ESS I/O server node is *not*  supported. Additionally, direct I/O must be used to perform a **read** or a **write** to a Spectrum Scale file.

For the GPFS Storage Server 2.0.0 thru 2.0.7, contact IBM Service to obtain an efix referencing APAR IV95040

To contact IBM Service, see <http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/>

For the GPFS Storage Server 2.5, contact Lenovo at <http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/systems/servers/high-density/gpfs-storage/>
