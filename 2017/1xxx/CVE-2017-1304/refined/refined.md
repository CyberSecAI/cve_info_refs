- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from an unsupported configuration where user applications run on an active ESS I/O server node and use direct I/O to read or write to a Spectrum Scale file. This leads to the use of an incorrect memory address, resulting in a daemon failure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the usage of an incorrect memory address during direct I/O operations in a specific unsupported configuration of IBM Spectrum Scale/GPFS on Elastic Storage Server (ESS)/GPFS Storage Server (GSS). This condition triggers a Signal 11 error.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can result in a Spectrum Scale/GPFS daemon failure, potentially causing denial of service (DoS) or undetected data corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves running user applications on an active ESS I/O server node which is an unsupported configuration, and using direct I/O to perform a read or write operation to a Spectrum Scale file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to run user applications on an active ESS I/O server node and be able to perform direct I/O read/write operations to the Spectrum Scale file system. This means that they need to have a user account on a server in the cluster and the ability to run code there. They also need to have a deep understanding of the inner workings of the Spectrum Scale file system.
