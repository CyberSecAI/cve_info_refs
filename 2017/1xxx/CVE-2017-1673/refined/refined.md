- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the Web UI of IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager, allowing users to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session, and alter the intended functionality of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Web UI, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the Web UI and inject malicious scripts, which may require some user interaction from other users of the application.
