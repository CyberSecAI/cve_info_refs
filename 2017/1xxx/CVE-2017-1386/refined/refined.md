- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient password policy enforcement in IBM API Connect, which could allow users to create passwords that do not comply with the configured policy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Bypassing of password policy restrictions
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially intercept and decrypt non-compliant passwords using man-in-the-middle techniques
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks (Man-in-the-middle attacks), where the attacker intercepts communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and IBM API Connect servers.
