- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When the authentication type is set to CLIENT, a user without proper authorization can activate the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control; specifically, a lack of sufficient authorization checks before allowing database activation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthorized user can activate the database, although further access requires proper authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based; an attacker with network access to the vulnerable IBM Db2 instance could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the affected database and be able to send commands to activate the database.
