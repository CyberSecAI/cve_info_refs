- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Premature termination of a client application thread during an MQGET call. This occurs when the client application is running on a channel with SHARECNV=1, causing a SIGSEGV and subsequent termination of the channel agent process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists due to the potential for a client application termination to trigger a crash in the channel agent process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to denial of service as the channel agent process terminates.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user can trigger the vulnerability by terminating a client application during an MQGET call, specifically on a channel with SHARECNV=1.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who can terminate a client application.
