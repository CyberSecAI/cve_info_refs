- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Business Process Manager web Process Designer, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within the Web UI. This can alter the intended functionality of the application and potentially lead to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface of the IBM Business Process Manager web Process Designer, where a user can inject malicious javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to embed JavaScript code in the Web UI. This typically means having a low-privileged user account on the system with the ability to modify the content of the web interface. The attacker needs to entice a user to execute the injected code to disclose information.
