- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the application's exposure of sensitive information through error messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure. The application is revealing sensitive data within error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially gain access to sensitive information. This information could potentially be used for further malicious activities or unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a low level of access complexity (AC:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application, suggesting that the vulnerability is accessible to internal users.
