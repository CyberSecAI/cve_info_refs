```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The IBM Security Identity Governance Virtual Appliance generates error messages that include sensitive information.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information Disclosure through error messages.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information about the system, its users, or associated data. This information could then be used to mount further attacks on the system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any attacker who can trigger an error message.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to trigger an error message and have knowledge of the system to interpret the exposed information.
