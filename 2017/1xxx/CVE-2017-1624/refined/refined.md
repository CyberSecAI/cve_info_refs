- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permission assignment for a security-critical resource. The software specifies permissions in a way that allows unintended actors to read or modify the resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the improper access control configuration of a critical resource, allowing unauthorized read or write access.
-  **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with low privileges can potentially read or modify security-critical resources. This could lead to a compromise of confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based attack, possibly internal to the network since low privilege is required
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low privileges on the affected system. They can be an internal user, as implied by CVSS vector requiring low privileges.
