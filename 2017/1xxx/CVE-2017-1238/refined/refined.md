The provided content relates to CVE-2017-1238.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is HTML injection vulnerability in IBM Quality Manager (RQM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is that the application is susceptible to HTML injection. Specifically, a remote attacker can inject malicious HTML code that, when viewed by another user, would execute within the security context of the hosting site. This is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) type of vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the victim's browser in the context of the vulnerable application. This can lead to:
*  Stealing user's cookies and session tokens, thus leading to account hijacking.
*  Defacing the web page.
*  Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*  Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, over the network. An attacker injects malicious HTML code into the application, which is then rendered by a user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML code into the vulnerable application, which requires having the minimal privilege of a logged-in user. User interaction is required for the injected code to be executed, meaning the victim must view the injected content.
