- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be embedded within the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to altering the intended functionality of the web UI and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the web UI, likely via a crafted URL or form input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to introduce malicious JavaScript code into the web UI, which typically requires user interaction such as clicking a malicious link, or manipulating data that is displayed in the UI. The attacker also requires a low level of privileges as indicated by the CVSS vector.
