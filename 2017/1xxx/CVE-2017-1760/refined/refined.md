- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A valid MQSC command execution can cause the queue manager agent thread to crash with a SIGSEGV signal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a local user to trigger a crash in the queue manager agent thread, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the crash might expose some sensitive information.
-  **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the queue manager agent thread, causing a denial of service. It can also potentially expose sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user with access to execute MQSC commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute valid MQSC commands on the affected IBM MQ systems.
