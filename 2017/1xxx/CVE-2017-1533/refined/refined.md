Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-1533

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The IBM Security Access Manager Appliance is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Altered Functionality: The injected JavaScript code can modify the intended behavior of the web UI.
*   Potential Credentials Disclosure: The attacker could potentially steal user credentials within a trusted session by using malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Web UI: The vulnerability is exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code in the web user interface of the application.
*   User interaction (UI:R) is required, where the victim must interact with the injected script for the attack to be successful

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to find a way to inject JavaScript code into the vulnerable input fields or parameters of the Web UI.
*   The attack can be initiated remotely (AV:N) with low complexity (AC:L), and no privileges are required (PR:N).

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM Security Access Manager Appliance versions 9.0.3.0-9.0.3.1.

**Remediation:**
*   Upgrade to IBM Security Access Manager Appliance version 9.0.4.0.

**CVSS Vector:** (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is a stored XSS as the injected script affects all users, not just the user who injected it.
