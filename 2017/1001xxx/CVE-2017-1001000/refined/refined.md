  "CVE-2017-1001000": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "An unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the WordPress REST API, specifically affecting versions 4.7.0 and 4.7.1. Due to inconsistent use of numeric IDs and PHP type juggling, an attacker can modify the content of any post or page on a vulnerable site.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of numeric IDs within the WordPress REST API and PHP's type juggling feature. The REST API prioritizes `$_GET` and `$_POST` values over those generated by the route's regular expression, allowing an attacker to inject alphanumeric characters into the ID parameter. Additionally, the `get_post()` function fails on non-numeric characters but the `update_item` method casts the ID to an integer *after* the permission check. This discrepancy allows a crafted request with a non-numeric ID to bypass the permission check, and then the type juggling will lead the post to update the post with a numeric ID.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inconsistent parameter handling in REST API endpoints",
        "Lack of proper input validation and sanitization",
        "Reliance on type juggling in PHP leading to unexpected behavior",
        "Improper authorization checks"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can modify the content of any post or page on a vulnerable WordPress site. This can lead to: content injection, SEO spam, and, depending on enabled plugins, potentially arbitrary code execution.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted HTTP requests to the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/<post_id>`.",
         "Use of `id` parameter with a mix of numeric and alphanumeric characters, exploiting PHP's type juggling."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication credentials. They only require the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker also needs to know a valid post id to modify a specific post or page."
