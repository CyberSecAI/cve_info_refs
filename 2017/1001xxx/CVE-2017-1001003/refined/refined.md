{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to replace or disguise forbidden object properties, like `constructor`, by using Unicode characters when creating an object in the mathjs library. This circumvents the intended security measures, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Improper handling of Unicode characters",
      "Inadequate object property validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain control over the application by injecting malicious JavaScript code through manipulated property names.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting malicious expressions with object properties containing unicode characters"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to inject or influence the evaluation of expressions within the mathjs library"
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2017-1001003"
