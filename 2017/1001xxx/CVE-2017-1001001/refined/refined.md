```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input when creating articles, allowing a malicious user to inject JavaScript code into the article content.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Lack of HttpOnly flag on session tokens"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an article, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the page. This can be used to steal session tokens and potentially take over user accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious payload within the article content, such as an `<img>` tag with a `src` attribute containing JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to create or edit articles within the application. This may require being a writer or administrator user."
