Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stemmed from the way `typed-function` handled function names. Specifically, it was possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through a specially crafted function name when creating a typed function. The injected code would then execute when the typed function was called.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Code Injection:** The core issue is a code injection vulnerability. The library was not properly sanitizing or validating function names, allowing an attacker to embed malicious code within the name string.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application using the `typed-function` library. This could lead to a variety of severe consequences, including:
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Privilege escalation.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Other malicious actions depending on the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the function name argument when creating a typed function using the `typed()` constructor.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to control or influence the function name used when creating a typed function. This could occur if the attacker has control over data passed to the `typed()` constructor.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the function name before it's used in the generated function code. The fix replaces all characters in the function name that are not alphanumeric, underscore, or dollar sign with an underscore, preventing code injection.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix was introduced in version 0.10.6 of the `typed-function` library.
*   The provided commit includes a test case (`test/security.test.js`) demonstrating the vulnerability and ensuring that the fix is effective.
*   The commit message states: "Fixed a security issue allowing to execute arbitrary JavaScript code via a specially prepared function name of a typed function."
