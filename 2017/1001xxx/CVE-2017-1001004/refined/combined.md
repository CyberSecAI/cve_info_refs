# History

## 2024-06-05, version 4.2.1

* Fix a bug in the new `override` option of method `addConversion`.

## 2024-06-05, version 4.2.0

* Extend methods `addConversion` and `addConversions` with a new option
  `{ override: boolean }` to allow overriding an existing conversion.

## 2023-09-13, version 4.1.1

* Fix #168: add a `"license": "MIT"` field to the `package.json` file.

## 2022-08-23, version 4.1.0

* Publish an UMD version of the library, like in v3.0.0. It is still necessary.
  The UMD version can be used in CommonJS applications and in the browser.

## 2022-08-22, version 4.0.0

!!! BE CAREFUL: BREAKING CHANGES !!!

* Breaking change: the code is converted into ES modules, and the library
  now outputs ES modules only instead of an UMD module.
  + If you're using `typed-function` inside and ES modules project,
    all will just keep working like before:
    ```
    import typed from 'typed-function'
    ```
  + If you're using `typed-function` in a CommonJS project, you'll have to
    import the library using a dynamic import:
    ```
    const typed = (await import('typed-function')).default
    ```
  + If you're importing `typed-function` straight into a browser page,
    you can load it as a module there:
    ```
    <script type="module">
      import typed from 'typed-function/lib/esm/typed-function.mjs'
    </script>
    ```

## 2022-08-16, version 3.0.1

* Fix #157: `typed()` can enter infinite loop when there is both `referToSelf`

  and `referTo` functions involved (#158). Thanks @gwhitney.
* Fix #155: `typed.addType()` fails if there is no `Object` type (#159).
  Thanks @gwhitney.

## 2022-05-12, version 3.0.0

!!! BE CAREFUL: BREAKING CHANGES !!!

Breaking changes:

* Fix #14: conversions now have preference over `any`. Thanks @gwhitney.
* The properties `typed.types` and `typed.conversions` have been removed.
  Instead of adding and removing types and conversions with those
  arrays, use the methods `addType`, `addTypes`, `addConversion`,
  `addConversions`, `removeConversion`, `clear`, `clearConversions`.
* The `this` variable is no longer bound to the typed function itself but is
  unbound. Instead, use `typed.referTo(...)` and `typed.referToSelf(...)`.

  By default, all function bodies will be scanned against the deprecated
  usage pattern of `this`, and an error will be thrown when encountered. To
  disable this validation step, set `typed.warnAgainstDeprecatedThis = false`.

  Example:

  ```
  // old:
  const square = typed({
    'number': x => x * x,
    'string': x => this(parseFloat(x))
  })

  // new:
  const square = typed({
    'number': x => x * x,
    'string': typed.referToSelf(function (self) {
      // using self is not optimal, if possible,
      // refer to a specific signature instead,
      // see next example
      return x => self(parseFloat(x))
    })
  })

  // optimized new:
  const square = typed({
    'number': x => x * x,
    'string': typed.referTo('number', function (squareNumber) {
      return x => sqrtNumber(parseFloat(x))
    })
  })
  ```
* The property `typed.ignore` is removed. If you need it, see if you can
  create a new `typed` instance without the types that you want to ignore, or
  filter the signatures passed to `typed()` by hand.
* Drop official support for Nodejs 12.

Non-breaking changes:

* Implemented new static functions, Thanks @gwhitney:
  + `typed.referTo(...string, callback: (resolvedFunctions: ...function) => function)`
  + `typed.referToSelf(callback: (self) => function)`
  + `typed.isTypedFunction(entity: any): boolean`
  + `typed.resolve(fn: typed-function, argList: Array<any>): signature-object`
  + `typed.findSignature(fn: typed-function, signature: string | Array, options: object) : signature-object`
  + `typed.addType(type: {name: string, test: function, ignored?: boolean} [, beforeObjectTest=true]): void`
  + `typed.addTypes(types: TypeDef[] [, before = 'any']): void`
  + `typed.clear(): void`
  + `typed.addConversions(conversions: ConversionDef[]): void`
  + `typed.removeConversion(conversion: ConversionDef): void`
  + `typed.clearConversions(): void`
* Refactored the `typed` constructor to be more flexible, accepting a
  combination of multiple typed functions or objects. And internally refactored
  the constructor to not use typed-function itself (#142). Thanks @gwhitney.
* Extended the benchmark script and added counting of creation of typed
  functions (#146).
* Fixes and extensions to `typed.find()` now correctly handling cases with
  rest or `any` parameters and matches requiring conversions; adds an
  `options` argument to control whether matches with conversions are allowed.
  Thanks @gwhitney.
* Fix to `typed.convert()`: Will now find a conversion even in presence of
  overlapping types.
* Reports all matching types in runtime errors, not just the first one.
* Improved documentation. Thanks @gwhitney.

## 2022-03-11, version 2.1.0

* Implemented configurable callbacks `typed.createError` and `typed.onMismatch`.
  Thanks @gwhitney.

## 2020-07-03, version 2.0.0

* Drop official support for node.js 6 and 8, though no breaking changes
  at this point.
* Implemented support for recursion using the `this` keyword. Thanks @nickewing.

## 2019-08-22, version 1.1.1

* Fix #15: passing `null` to an `Object` parameter throws wrong error.

## 2018-07-28, version 1.1.0

* Implemented support for creating typed functions from a plain function
  having a property `signature`.
* Implemented providing a name when merging multiple typed functions.

## 2018-07-04, version 1.0.4

* By default, `addType` will insert new types before the `Object` test
  since the `Object` test also matches arrays and classes.
* Upgraded `devDependencies`.

## 2018-03-17, version 1.0.3

* Dropped usage of ES6 feature `Array.find`, so typed-function is
  directly usable on any ES5 compatible JavaScript engine (like IE11).

## 2018-03-17, version 1.0.2

* Fixed typed-function not working on browsers that don't allow
  setting the `name` property of a function.

## 2018-02-21, version 1.0.1

* Upgraded dev dependencies.

## 2018-02-20, version 1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 is rewritten from scratch. The API is the same,
though generated error messages may differ slightly.

Version 1.0.0 no longer uses `eval` under the hood to achieve good
performance. This reduces security risks and makes typed-functions
easier to debug.

Type `Object` is no longer treated specially from other types. This
means that the test for `Object` must not give false positives for
types like `Array`, `Date`, or class instances.

In version 1.0.0, support for browsers like IE9, IE10 is dropped,
though typed-function can still work when using es5 and es6 polyfills.

## 2018-01-24, version 0.10.7

* Fixed the field `data.actual` in a `TypeError` message containing
  the type index instead of the actual type of the argument.

## 2017-11-18, version 0.10.6

* Fixed a security issue allowing to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  code via a specially prepared function name of a typed function.
  Thanks Masato Kinugawa.

## 2016-11-18, version 0.10.5

* Fixed the use of multi-layered use of `any` type. See #8.

## 2016-04-09, version 0.10.4

* Typed functions can only inherit names from other typed functions and no
  longer from regular JavaScript functions since these names are unreliable:
  they can be manipulated by minifiers and browsers.

## 2015-10-07, version 0.10.3

* Reverted the fix of v0.10.2 until the introduced issue with variable
  arguments is fixed too. Added unit test for the latter case.

## 2015-10-04, version 0.10.2

* Fixed support for using `any` multiple times in a single signture.
  Thanks @luke-gumbley.

## 2015-07-27, version 0.10.1

* Fixed functions `addType` and `addConversion` not being robust against
  replaced arrays `typed.types` and `typed.conversions`.

## 2015-07-26, version 0.10.0

* Dropped support for the following construction signatures in order to simplify
  the API:
  + `typed(signature: string, fn: function)`
  + `typed(name: string, signature: string, fn: function)`
* Implemented convenience methods `typed.addType` and `typed.addConversion`.
* Changed the casing of the type `'function'` to `'Function'`. Breaking change.
* `typed.types` is now an ordered Array containing objects
  `{name: string, test: function}`. Breaking change.
* List with expected types in error messages no longer includes converted types.

## 2015-05-17, version 0.9.0

* `typed.types` is now an ordered Array containing objects
  `{type: string, test: function}` instead of an object. Breaking change.
* `typed-function` now allows merging typed functions with duplicate signatures
  when they point to the same function.

## 2015-05-16, version 0.8.3

* Function `typed.find` now throws an error instead of returning `null` when a
  signature is not found.
* Fixed: the attached signatures no longer contains signatures with conversions.

## 2015-05-09, version 0.8.2

* Fixed function `typed.convert` not handling the case where the value already
  has the requested type. Thanks @rjbaucells.

## 2015-05-09, version 0.8.1

* Implemented option `typed.ignore` to ignore/filter signatures of a typed
  function.

## 2015-05-09, version 0.8.0

* Implemented function `create` to create a new instance of typed-function.
* Implemented a utility function `convert(value, type)` (#1).
* Implemented a simple `typed.find` function to find the implementation of a
  specific function signature.
* Extended the error messages to denote the function name, like `"Too many arguments in function foo (...)"`.

## 2015-04-17, version 0.7.0

* Performance improvements.

## 2015-03-08, version 0.6.3

* Fixed generated internal Signature and Param objects not being cleaned up
  after the typed function has been generated.

## 2015-02-26, version 0.6.2

* Fixed a bug sometimes not ordering the handling of any type arguments last.
* Fixed a bug sometimes not choosing the signature with the lowest number of
  conversions.

## 2015-02-07, version 0.6.1

* Large code refactoring.
* Fixed bugs related to any type parameters.

## 2015-01-16, version 0.6.0

* Removed the configuration option `minify`
  (it's not clear yet whether minifying really improves the performance).
* Internal code simplifications.
* Bug fixes.

## 2015-01-07, version 0.5.0

* Implemented support for merging typed functions.
* Typed functions inherit the name of the function in case of one signature.
* Fixed a bug where a regular argument was not matched when there was a
  signature with variable arguments too.
* Slightly changed the error messages.

## 2014-12-17, version 0.4.0

* Introduced new constructor options, create a typed function as
  `typed([name,] signature, fn)` or `typed([name,] signatures)`.
* Support for multiple types per parameter like `number | string, number'`.
* Support for variable parameters like `sting, ...number'`.
* Changed any type notation `'*'` to `'any'`.
* Implemented detailed error messages.
* Implemented option `typed.config.minify`.

## 2014-11-05, version 0.3.1

* Renamed module to `typed-function`.

## 2014-11-05, version 0.3.0

* Implemented support for any type arguments (denoted with `*`).

## 2014-10-23, version 0.2.0

* Implemented support for named functions.
* Implemented support for type conversions.
* Implemented support for custom types.
* Library packaged as UMD, usable with CommonJS (node.js), AMD, and browser globals.

## 2014-10-21, version 0.1.0

* Implemented support for functions with zero, one, or multiple arguments.

## 2014-10-19, version 0.0.1

* First release (no functionality yet)
