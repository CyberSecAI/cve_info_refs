* Single Calendar

## Installation

1. Install the plugin by uploading the zip file (Plugins > Add New > Upload)
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Click on the ‘WP Booking System’ menu entry
4. Click on ‘Add New’ at the top of the page to create a calendar
5. To embed a calendar on a page or post, use the ‘Add Calendar’ button at that page

## FAQ

### How can I embed the booking calendar on a page or post?

By using the ‘Add Calendar’ button above the editor, the Gutenberg module, a widget, or directly by using the shortcode. An example of the shortcode is:

```
[wpbs id="1" title="yes/no" legend="yes/no" language="auto" form_id="1"]

```

### Will this booking system work for me?

We’re pretty sure about that! We made this plugin as ‘flexible’ as possible. The booking plugin works with bookings on a per day basis (no time slots). So if you rent something out on a daily basis, then the WP Booking System is a good choice.
