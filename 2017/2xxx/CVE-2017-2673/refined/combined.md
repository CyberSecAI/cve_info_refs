# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-06 09:40:34 UTC  ``` An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned to the user's project regardless of the federation mapping when there are rules in which group-based assignments are not used.

### Bug Description

Keystone stable/ocata. Federation is used with the following mapping: <http://paste.openstack.org/show/ou0GTGp9fTQIzcHtixUU/> . As you can see, all users get a \_member\_ role, which has almost no permissions, and this role is granted for the newly-created project.

User admin@Default, with role admin in project admin@Default wants to do something for project "Dev project for <email address hidden>". admin@Default assigns themselves role admin on the project (openstack role assign --user admin --user-domain Default --project-id <id for Dev project for unprivileged@> admin)

At this point, if federated user "<email address hidden>" gets a new token by going through federation and then scopes the token, they get a token with role admin. Here is an example of such token: <http://paste.openstack.org/show/7vncdFywNmi6WZ9S7KXX/>. In horizon it means they can see and do everything admin can do.

There is no record about unprivileged user having role admin in the database. This assignment is not displayed in `openstack role assignment list`. The assignment only gets effective when a scoped token is requested.

Workaround for the issue is to remove role admin from admin@Default on project "Dev project for unpriveledged@". Unprivileged user immediately loses admin privileges; the token is still valid, but there is no role "admin" in GET /v3/auth/tokens .

To use this vulnerability, attacker can ask admin get a role in their project (hey admin@Default, could you please have a look at instances in my project?) and get all admin privileges as soon as admin assigns themselves role at attacker's project.

I just tested the patch and it appears to work. It's very worrisome looking at the code. I honestly can't tell if there are other situations where we could have the same problem.

Could this be caused by a special configuration, or is this happening for all federation setup?

It's surprising that the group\_ids is empty, shouldn't it contains the \_member\_ id ?

Here is an early impact description draft:

Title: Incorrect role assignment with federated Keystone

Reporter: Boris Bobrov (Mirantis)

Products: Keystone

Affects: >=9.0.0 <=9.3.0, >=10.0.0 <=10.0.1, ==11.0.0

Description:

Boris Bobrov from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Keystone Federation. An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned with the user's project regardless of the federation mapping. For example, by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups using the Keystone federation are affected.

This is happening for federation setup where both conditions are satisfied:

 - auto-provisioning capabilities are used ("project" JSON object is used)

 - there are rules in which group-based assignments are NOT used ("group" JSON object is not used).

Mitaka and Newton are not affected, Ocata and Pike are affected.

Thanks for the precision Boris, here is the updated impact description:

Title: Incorrect role assignment with federated Keystone

Reporter: Boris Bobrov (Mail.Ru)

Products: Keystone

Affects: ==11.0.0

Description:

Boris Bobrov from Mail.Ru reported a vulnerability in Keystone Federation. An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned to the user's project regardless of the federation mapping when there are rules in which group-based assignments are not used. For example, by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups using the Keystone federation with projects auto-provisioning and no group based assignments rules are affected.

Tristan's updated impact description in comment #10 looks good to me, though we should probably wait to request a CVE assignment from our CNA until keystone-coresec reviewers have triaged and confirmed the report.

Just for completeness, Lance (or anyone from keystone-coresec), can you please triage the Keystone bugtask for this report and confirm that you consider it a vulnerability in the software? I know you've confirmed that the attached patch fixes the reported behavior, but haven't actually said anywhere that it's unintended behavior and so I want to make sure we don't press forward announcing something that isn't actually a vulnerability. Thanks!

I was contacted by folks from Mirantis. They found out that:

1. This feature is not directly tied to auto-provisioning

2. There are mappings that don't use auto-provisioning and are still vulnerable to issue with incorrect roles being assigned.

I believe that their issue and mine are actually the same issue. My patch still fixes the bug, but now the affected versions are Mitaka, Newton and Ocata.

For example, people with mapping like <http://paste.openstack.org/show/606171/> are affected too.

As far as i understand, all installations with mappings not using key "groups" are affected.

I suggest to add the person who reported the issue to me to this bugreport. His profile at lp is <https://launchpad.net/~dmitrymex>

Based on comment #18, we need to re-spin the proposed patch in comment #6 to make it test a mapping that doesn't enable auto-provisioning. We should certainly keep the auto-provisioning test coverage, but we should add a test case that shows this can be done with mappings that don't rely on that feature.

Jeremy and Tristan,

Do we need to extend the proposed disclosure date if the communication needs to be amended?

re: comment#21 and Mitaka being affected

While I haven't come to the conclusion that the bug can be triggered in Mitaka, I'm of the opinion that the function get\_roles\_for\_groups() should still have the same patch as the other affected versions (even without test cases to drop engineering load if need be).

based on:

a) the patch is simple and best practice

b) the function is sensitive

c) we may not have covered all edge cases for deployment scenarios

Maybe I am a little bias considering Mitaka's EOL date

Re if Mitaka is affected:

When we tried to get unscoped token in Mitaka, we failed with the following trace:

(got the trace via additional logging). I.e. user with no groups was rejected to log in. I don't know a way to get scoped token without obtaining unscoped one first. If that is indeed impossible, than Mitaka is not affected.

On the other hand, merging the fix into Mitaka should not break anything.

Considering we may not have covered all the edge cases, it seems like a good idea to mention Mitaka as affected. Though the branch will probably be EOLed by the time the patch are proposed on gerrit, and the tests doesn't applies cleanly on mitaka's branch.

Mitaka is probably affected too, if someone directly gets a project-scoped federated token, but i cannot verify that because of lack of environment. The fix should be the same, but the unit test needs to be heavily changed. I will do my best to write them soon, but feel free to do it if you need it sooner.

Mitaka is not affected. It is impossible to get a project-scoped token skipping the unscoped one, and getting unscoped one fails (there is a test for that).

The patches in comments #29, #30, and #31 check out for me. The only comment I'd make would be to not specifically reference the bug number in a doc string while in a public review system, since we don't have a known workaround available (unless folks change their mappings). I'm not sure how sensitive that is, or what the attack vector is like given the time window of review, but I'll defer to the opinion of others. Otherwise, the code works and the tests are clean and concise. The technical aspects of the patch address the bug.

I approve based on all technical aspects of all proposed patches (#29, #30, #31). Thanks, Boris!

Lance, the bug will be made public prior to submit patch to gerrit (e.g.: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#open-bug-push-patches> ), so it seems acceptable to reference the original bug report in doc strings.

Thanks for the review!

Do not fetch group assignments without groups

Without the change, the method fetched all assignments for a project

    or domain, regardless of who has the assignment, user or group. This

    led to situation when federated user without groups could scope a token

    with other user's rules.

Return empty list of assignments if no groups were passed.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

### Bug Description

Keystone stable/ocata. Federation is used with the following mapping: <http://paste.openstack.org/show/ou0GTGp9fTQIzcHtixUU/> . As you can see, all users get a \_member\_ role, which has almost no permissions, and this role is granted for the newly-created project.

User admin@Default, with role admin in project admin@Default wants to do something for project "Dev project for <email address hidden>". admin@Default assigns themselves role admin on the project (openstack role assign --user admin --user-domain Default --project-id <id for Dev project for unprivileged@> admin)

At this point, if federated user "<email address hidden>" gets a new token by going through federation and then scopes the token, they get a token with role admin. Here is an example of such token: <http://paste.openstack.org/show/7vncdFywNmi6WZ9S7KXX/>. In horizon it means they can see and do everything admin can do.

There is no record about unprivileged user having role admin in the database. This assignment is not displayed in `openstack role assignment list`. The assignment only gets effective when a scoped token is requested.

Workaround for the issue is to remove role admin from admin@Default on project "Dev project for unpriveledged@". Unprivileged user immediately loses admin privileges; the token is still valid, but there is no role "admin" in GET /v3/auth/tokens .

To use this vulnerability, attacker can ask admin get a role in their project (hey admin@Default, could you please have a look at instances in my project?) and get all admin privileges as soon as admin assigns themselves role at attacker's project.

I just tested the patch and it appears to work. It's very worrisome looking at the code. I honestly can't tell if there are other situations where we could have the same problem.

Could this be caused by a special configuration, or is this happening for all federation setup?

It's surprising that the group\_ids is empty, shouldn't it contains the \_member\_ id ?

Here is an early impact description draft:

Title: Incorrect role assignment with federated Keystone

Reporter: Boris Bobrov (Mirantis)

Products: Keystone

Affects: >=9.0.0 <=9.3.0, >=10.0.0 <=10.0.1, ==11.0.0

Description:

Boris Bobrov from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Keystone Federation. An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned with the user's project regardless of the federation mapping. For example, by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups using the Keystone federation are affected.

This is happening for federation setup where both conditions are satisfied:

 - auto-provisioning capabilities are used ("project" JSON object is used)

 - there are rules in which group-based assignments are NOT used ("group" JSON object is not used).

> Affects: >=9.0.0 <=9.3.0, >=10.0.0 <=10.0.1, ==11.0.0

Mitaka and Newton are not affected, Ocata and Pike are affected.

Tristan's updated impact description in comment #10 looks good to me, though we should probably wait to request a CVE assignment from our CNA until keystone-coresec reviewers have triaged and confirmed the report.

Just for completeness, Lance (or anyone from keystone-coresec), can you please triage the Keystone bugtask for this report and confirm that you consider it a vulnerability in the software? I know you've confirmed that the attached patch fixes the reported behavior, but haven't actually said anywhere that it's unintended behavior and so I want to make sure we don't press forward announcing something that isn't actually a vulnerability. Thanks!

I was contacted by folks from Mirantis. They found out that:

1. This feature is not directly tied to auto-provisioning

2. There are mappings that don't use auto-provisioning and are still vulnerable to issue with incorrect roles being assigned.

I believe that their issue and mine are actually the same issue. My patch still fixes the bug, but now the affected versions are Mitaka, Newton and Ocata.

For example, people with mapping like <http://paste.openstack.org/show/606171/> are affected too.

As far as i understand, all installations with mappings not using key "groups" are affected.

I suggest to add the person who reported the issue to me to this bugreport. His profile at lp is <https://launchpad.net/~dmitrymex>

Based on comment #18, we need to re-spin the proposed patch in comment #6 to make it test a mapping that doesn't enable auto-provisioning. We should certainly keep the auto-provisioning test coverage, but we should add a test case that shows this can be done with mappings that don't rely on that feature.

Jeremy and Tristan,

Do we need to extend the proposed disclosure date if the communication needs to be amended?

New impact description with Newton affect and without the auto-provisioning mention:

Title: Incorrect role assignment with federated Keystone

Reporter: Boris Bobrov (Mail.Ru)

Products: Keystone

Affects: >=10.0.0 <=10.0.1, ==11.0.0

Description:

Boris Bobrov from Mail.Ru reported a vulnerability in Keystone Federation. An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned to the user's project regardless of the federation mapping when there are rules in which group-based assignments are not used. For example, by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups using the Keystone federation without group based assignments rules are affected.

re: comment#21 and Mitaka being affected

While I haven't come to the conclusion that the bug can be triggered in Mitaka, I'm of the opinion that the function get\_roles\_for\_groups() should still have the same patch as the other affected versions (even without test cases to drop engineering load if need be).

based on:

a) the patch is simple and best practice

b) the function is sensitive

c) we may not have covered all edge cases for deployment scenarios

Maybe I am a little bias considering Mitaka's EOL date

Re if Mitaka is affected:

When we tried to get unscoped token in Mitaka, we failed with the following trace:

[req-a3e0e824-2c97-466a-b4c2-38079b1f0fa9 - - - - -] Unable to find valid groups while using mapping ldap-map

(got the trace via additional logging). I.e. user with no groups was rejected to log in. I don't know a way to get scoped token without obtaining unscoped one first. If that is indeed impossible, than Mitaka is not affected.

On the other hand, merging the fix into Mitaka should not break anything.

Beside a pep8 error, tox verified patch #27 on stable/ocata.

Considering we may not have covered all the edge cases, it seems like a good idea to mention Mitaka as affected. Though the branch will probably be EOLed by the time the patch are proposed on gerrit, and the tests doesn't applies cleanly on mitaka's branch.

Mitaka is probably affected too, if someone directly gets a project-scoped federated token, but i cannot verify that because of lack of environment. The fix should be the same, but the unit test needs to be heavily changed. I will do my best to write them soon, but feel free to do it if you need it sooner.

Mitaka is not affected. It is impossible to get a project-scoped token skipping the unscoped one, and getting unscoped one fails (there is a test for that).

Thanks for the quick feedback, so the impact description proposed in comment #24 is still valid.

Assuming the patches proposed in #29, #30 and #31 are pre-approved, I'll follow-up the pre-OSSA with this new disclosure date: 2017-04-25, 1500 UTC.

@horizon-coresec, please review the proposed patches.

The patches in comments #29, #30, and #31 check out for me. The only comment I'd make would be to not specifically reference the bug number in a doc string while in a public review system, since we don't have a known workaround available (unless folks change their mappings). I'm not sure how sensitive that is, or what the attack vector is like given the time window of review, but I'll defer to the opinion of others. Otherwise, the code works and the tests are clean and concise. The technical aspects of the patch address the bug.

I approve based on all technical aspects of all proposed patches (#29, #30, #31). Thanks, Boris!

Lance, the bug will be made public prior to submit patch to gerrit (e.g.: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#open-bug-push-patches> ), so it seems acceptable to reference the original bug report in doc strings.

Thanks for the review!

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1597)

## Topic

An update for openstack-keystone is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities. The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style logins.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-keystone (10.0.1). (BZ#1431715)

Security Fix(es):

* An authorization-check flaw was discovered in federation configurations of the OpenStack Identity service (keystone). An authenticated federated user could request permissions to a project and unintentionally be granted all related roles including administrative roles. (CVE-2017-2673)

Red Hat would like to thank the Openstack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Boris Bobrov (Mail.Ru) as the original reporter.

## Topic

An update for openstack-keystone is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities. The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style logins.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-keystone (9.3.0). (BZ#1427684)

Security Fix(es):

* An authorization-check flaw was discovered in federation configurations of the OpenStack Identity service (keystone). An authenticated federated user could request permissions to a project and unintentionally be granted all related roles including administrative roles. (CVE-2017-2673)

Red Hat would like to thank the Openstack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Boris Bobrov (Mail.Ru) as the original reporter.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-06 09:40:34 UTC  ``` An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned to the user's project regardless of the federation mapping when there are rules in which group-based assignments are not used. For example, by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups using the Keystone federation with projects auto-provisioning and no group based assignments rules are affected.  Affected versions: 10.0.0, 10.0.1, 11.0.0   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-06 09:40:44 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Openstack project Upstream: Boris Bobrov (Mail.Ru)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-07 07:30:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1269600](attachment.cgi?id=1269600&action=diff "master pike patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1269600&action=edit "master pike patch") master pike patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c3)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-07 07:31:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1269602](attachment.cgi?id=1269602&action=diff "stable ocata patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1269602&action=edit "stable ocata patch") stable ocata patch   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c13)  Tim Suter    2017-04-20 05:19:29 UTC  ``` new patches are under review upstream for newton, ocata and pike - will post them once they are accepted.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c14)  Tim Suter    2017-04-20 06:48:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1272868](attachment.cgi?id=1272868&action=diff "cve-2017-2673-openstack-10-newton.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1272868&action=edit "cve-2017-2673-openstack-10-newton.patch") cve-2017-2673-openstack-10-newton.patch  added new patch from upstream for openstack 10   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c15)  Tim Suter    2017-04-20 06:55:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1272869](attachment.cgi?id=1272869&action=diff "cve-2017-2673-openstack-11-ocata.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1272869&action=edit "cve-2017-2673-openstack-11-ocata.patch") cve-2017-2673-openstack-11-ocata.patch   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c16)  Tim Suter    2017-04-20 06:55:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1272870](attachment.cgi?id=1272870&action=diff "cve-2017-2673-openstack-12-pike.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1272870&action=edit "cve-2017-2673-openstack-12-pike.patch") cve-2017-2673-openstack-12-pike.patch   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c18)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-26 06:49:07 UTC  ``` References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/125>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-14 15:42:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka)  Via RHSA-2017:1461 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1461](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1461)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1439586#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-28 15:19:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2017:1597 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1597](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1597)   ``` |  |

# [OSSA-2017-004] federated user gets wrong role (CVE-2017-2673)

================================================================
OSSA-2017-004: Incorrect role assignment with federated Keystone
================================================================

:Date: April 25, 2017
:CVE: CVE-2017-2673

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Keystone: >=10.0.0 <=10.0.1, ==11.0.0

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Boris Bobrov from Mail.Ru reported a vulnerability in Keystone
Federation. An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned
to the user's project regardless of the federation mapping when there
are rules in which group-based assignments are not used. For example,
by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user
may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups
using the Keystone federation without group based assignments rules
are affected.

Patches

- <https://review.openstack.org/459732> (Ocata)
- <https://review.openstack.org/459705> (Pike)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
