Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2834:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `license_recv` function of FreeRDP, specifically in how it handles the length of the received data during license authentication. The length value is read directly from a server-controlled packet and used to decrypt the received data using `rdp_decrypt`, which calls the OpenSSL RC4 function. If the attacker supplies a length value less than 4, a negative value will be passed to the decrypt function causing an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129):** The code does not properly validate the length parameter before using it in a calculation and passing it to the decryption function.
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** Passing a negative value to the decryption function will cause an out of bound memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the client by exploiting the out-of-bounds write condition.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious server or man-in-the-middle attacker could cause the FreeRDP client to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RDP Server:** An attacker can set up a malicious RDP server designed to send crafted responses.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept and modify legitimate RDP server responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the RDP server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack to manipulate the server response sent to the client.
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted length value less than 4 in the server response during the license authentication process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tyler Bohan of Cisco Talos.
*   The vulnerability affects FreeRDP versions up to 2.0.0-beta1+android11.
*   The provided crash log shows an "incorrect checksum for freed object" error, indicating memory corruption, consistent with an out-of-bounds write.
*   The Talos report includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
