Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2145:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a session fixation issue in Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The software is vulnerable to session fixation (CWE-384). This allows an attacker to potentially hijack a user's session.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote unauthenticated attacker may perform unintended operations with the logged-in user's privileges. This means an attacker could potentially gain access to a user's account and perform actions as that user without having the user's actual password.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires user interaction (UI:R). An attacker would likely need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page to exploit the session fixation vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any authentication (PR:N) and can be remote. However, the attack requires a victim to interact with a specially crafted URL.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-2145 details a session fixation vulnerability in Cybozu Garoon. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into interacting with a malicious link, potentially leading to account hijacking and unauthorized actions with the victim's privileges.
