Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-2951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the handling of XFA (XML Forms Architecture) hyphenation objects in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. The software fails to properly validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. This means that the software attempts to access a memory location after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This means the attacker could potentially gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction. This interaction can take the form of:
    *   Visiting a malicious web page crafted to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Opening a malicious PDF file designed to exploit the flaw.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, making it possible to exploit it over the internet or via other network connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious file (PDF) or website that the victim can access.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Details:**
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '25811'.
*  Adobe has released an update to correct this vulnerability.

**Summary**
This vulnerability is a use-after-free flaw in the handling of XFA hyphenation objects in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. It can be triggered by user interaction such as visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file, potentially allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution and gain control over the victim's system.
