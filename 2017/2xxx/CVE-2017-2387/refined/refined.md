Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-2387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Apple Music Android application (versions 1.2.1 and below) did not properly validate SSL certificates when connecting to login and payment servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient SSL Certificate Validation:** The application failed to verify the authenticity of SSL certificates presented by the server. This allowed the application to silently accept bogus certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker performing a MITM attack could present fake SSL certificates to the application.
*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Due to the lack of validation, an attacker could intercept and capture sensitive user information (potentially including login credentials and payment details) without the user's knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MITM Attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the user's device and the Apple servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Network Position:** The attacker must have the capability to intercept and modify network traffic (e.g., by controlling a WiFi network or through ARP poisoning).
*   **Ability to Generate Bogus SSL Certificates:** The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain fake SSL certificates that would be accepted by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Apple Music for Android version 2.0.0, released on April 4, 2017.
*   The vulnerability was reported by David Coomber of Info-Sec.CA.
*   Apple confirmed the vulnerability on October 5, 2016, and released a fix on April 4, 2017.
*   The affected Android versions are 4.3 and later, but the vulnerability existed in Apple Music app versions 1.2.1 and below.
