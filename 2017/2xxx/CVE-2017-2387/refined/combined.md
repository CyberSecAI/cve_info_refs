October 20, 2024There's some kind of a problem with Shuffle play. At some point songs just start playing in alphabetical order. I don't know how exactly to reproduce the issue. When I start playing songs by pressing the Shuffle button and I have to turn off the BT device for a while and then turn it back on, sometimes the songs continue playing in alphabetical order (by song titles).22 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUDFRJdgVK1uZjEAbNtOVlqWVAlSrk2lou4h87Fu0wPo1MJLf5j=s32-rw)Shane Barnes*more\_vert*

January 24, 2025This latest update really screwed things up. The app closes every time I lock my screen, when I unlock its back at my phone's home screen every time. Then when I go back to now playing and press play, the song just keeps going after it's end time and I have to skip to the next track manually. It has frozen multiple times. Tried force stopping and restarting my phone. And the new "Sound Check" feature doesn't do anything. No effect at all.287 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLZBgqt9pSsDVHUtbR38DIt6242NyDUG9iCvcqafVEvYd0RE-c=s32-rw-mo)Juan Villarreal*more\_vert*

December 30, 2024Pros: Great music catalog, probably the best of all music apps. Excellent quality of sound. Decent user interface. Good compression without sacrificing sound. Playlists seamlessly synced in all your devices. Cons: Constantly changes the songs from your playlists for other versions without asking. Songs get removed from the catalog unexpectedly. The app demands constant connection to internet. Downloads don't stay in your device for long periods, you need to redownload them often.89 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
## What’s new

Sound Check adjusts the loudness between different songs to play at the same volume.

This update also adds:
Listen to three new stations for Latin, Dance, and Chill, along with the ones you know and love. Available worldwide, 24/7 on Radio.[*flag*Flag as inappropriate](https://support.google.com/googleplay/?p=report_content)
