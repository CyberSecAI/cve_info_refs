Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the kernel.
- It occurs within the `mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe_trap` function.
- The function uses a size value (`sz`) read from userspace to allocate a kernel heap buffer.
- However, a subsequent `copyin` operation uses a userspace pointer to the size (`args->recipe_size`) instead of the allocated size (`sz`), leading to a controlled heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A heap buffer overflow allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated memory region.
- **Use of User-Controlled Size:** The kernel function directly uses a user-supplied size without proper validation in the `copyin` operation, allowing for out-of-bounds write.
- **Lack of Size Validation:** The vulnerability stems from using the `args->recipe_size` which is a user controlled pointer rather than `sz` which is the validated size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution with Kernel Privileges:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This leads to full system compromise.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The exploit can also be used for denial of service by crashing the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** This vulnerability is exploitable by a local application.
- The `mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe_trap` function is a mach trap that can be called from any context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute code on the target system:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the system to call the vulnerable mach trap with malicious arguments.
- **Knowledge of Kernel Structures/Internals:** While not explicitly stated, successful exploitation likely requires knowledge of kernel memory layout and structures.
- **Ability to manipulate the `mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe_args` structure**: The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to the vulnerable mach trap, specifically:
   - `recipe`: user controlled pointer to the recipe contents.
   - `recipe_size`: user controlled pointer to the size of the recipe contents.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Apple products: iOS, macOS, and watchOS and tvOS.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available, demonstrating the ability to gain kernel arbitrary read/write on iOS 10.2.
