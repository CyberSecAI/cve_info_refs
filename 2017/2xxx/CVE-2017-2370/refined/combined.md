mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe_trap is a mach trap which can be called from any context

Here's the code:

  kern_return_t
  mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe_trap(struct mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe_args *args)
  {
    ipc_voucher_t voucher = IV_NULL;
    kern_return_t kr = KERN_SUCCESS;
    mach_msg_type_number_t sz = 0;

    if (copyin(args->recipe_size, (void *)&sz, sizeof(sz)))     <---------- (a)
      return KERN_MEMORY_ERROR;

    if (sz > MACH_VOUCHER_ATTR_MAX_RAW_RECIPE_ARRAY_SIZE)
      return MIG_ARRAY_TOO_LARGE;

    voucher = convert_port_name_to_voucher(args->voucher_name);
    if (voucher == IV_NULL)
      return MACH_SEND_INVALID_DEST;

    mach_msg_type_number_t __assert_only max_sz = sz;

    if (sz < MACH_VOUCHER_TRAP_STACK_LIMIT) {
      /* keep small recipes on the stack for speed */
      uint8_t krecipe[sz];
      if (copyin(args->recipe, (void *)krecipe, sz)) {
        kr = KERN_MEMORY_ERROR;
        goto done;
      }
      kr = mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe(voucher, args->key,
                                            (mach_voucher_attr_raw_recipe_t)krecipe, &sz);
      assert(sz <= max_sz);

      if (kr == KERN_SUCCESS && sz > 0)
        kr = copyout(krecipe, (void *)args->recipe, sz);
    } else {
      uint8_t *krecipe = kalloc((vm_size_t)sz);                 <---------- (b)
      if (!krecipe) {
        kr = KERN_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE;
        goto done;
      }

      if (copyin(args->recipe, (void *)krecipe, args->recipe_size)) {         <----------- (c)
        kfree(krecipe, (vm_size_t)sz);
        kr = KERN_MEMORY_ERROR;
        goto done;
      }

      kr = mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe(voucher, args->key,
                                            (mach_voucher_attr_raw_recipe_t)krecipe, &sz);
      assert(sz <= max_sz);

      if (kr == KERN_SUCCESS && sz > 0)
        kr = copyout(krecipe, (void *)args->recipe, sz);
      kfree(krecipe, (vm_size_t)sz);
    }

    kr = copyout(&sz, args->recipe_size, sizeof(sz));

  done:
    ipc_voucher_release(voucher);
    return kr;
  }

Here's the argument structure (controlled from userspace)

  struct mach_voucher_extract_attr_recipe_args {
    PAD_ARG_(mach_port_name_t, voucher_name);
    PAD_ARG_(mach_voucher_attr_key_t, key);
    PAD_ARG_(mach_voucher_attr_raw_recipe_t, recipe);
    PAD_ARG_(user_addr_t, recipe_size);
  };

recipe and recipe_size are userspace pointers.

At point (a) four bytes are read from the userspace pointer recipe_size into sz.

At point (b) if sz was less than MACH_VOUCHER_ATTR_MAX_RAW_RECIPE_ARRAY_SIZE (5120) and greater than MACH_VOUCHER_TRAP_STACK_LIMIT (256)
sz is used to allocate a kernel heap buffer.

At point (c) copyin is called again to copy userspace memory into that buffer which was just allocated, but rather than passing sz (the
validate size which was allocated) args->recipe_size is passed as the size. This is the userspace pointer *to* the size, not the size!

This leads to a completely controlled kernel heap overflow.

Tested on MacOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555)

Exploit for iOS 10.2 iPod Touch 6G 14C92 gets kernel arbitrary r/w

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
