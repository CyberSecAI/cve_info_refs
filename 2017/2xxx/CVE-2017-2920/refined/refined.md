  "cve": "CVE-2017-2920",
  "description": "An memory corruption vulnerability exists in the .SVG parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.02. A specially crafted .SVG file can cause a vulnerability resulting in memory corruption, which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can send a specific .SVG file to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of SVG path data, specifically within the `feGaussianBlur` filter. The size parameter used in a memset operation is derived from the SVG Path's 'd' attribute (a series of path descriptions) after a float-to-int conversion. A crafted SVG can cause this size parameter to become excessively large leading to an out-of-bounds write via the memset call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write",
      "Improper calculation of buffer size based on user-controlled input",
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted .SVG file needs to be processed by the vulnerable application."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SVG file to the application for parsing. No special privileges are required."

   "patch_details":{
      "libofx_patch":"A fix was implemented in libofx by limiting the iteration in the `sanitize_proprietary_tags` function to the size of output buffers, preventing a buffer overflow. This commit addresses TALOS-2017-0317."
