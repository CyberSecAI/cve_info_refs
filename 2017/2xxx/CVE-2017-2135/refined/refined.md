Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "WP Statistics" contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected XSS (CWE-79):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in a web page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a logged-in user who visits a crafted URL. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (N):** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **User Interaction (UI):** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link (or otherwise visit a page with the malicious script injected).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability (Privileges Required: None).
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that injects JavaScript into the vulnerable plugin's output and then trick the user to access the URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects WP Statistics version 12.0.1 and earlier.
- The vendor has released a fix in version 12.0.2 and 12.0.3.
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.1 (Medium Severity)
- The CVSS v2 score is 2.6 (Low Severity)
