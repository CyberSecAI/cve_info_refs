Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2870:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `tiff_image_parse` function within the Gdk-Pixbuf library when compiled with Clang and high optimization flags (`-O3`).
- The code contains checks for integer overflows that are ineffective when compiled with Clang at high optimization levels, due to "Undefined Behavior" in the C standard for signed integer overflows which Clang utilizes to remove the checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer overflow:** Specifically, the multiplication `height * (width * 4)` overflows due to the large values of height and width.
- **Heap overflow:** The overflowed result is used to allocate a buffer. Subsequently, a mismatch between the allocated buffer size and the actual data being written leads to an out-of-bounds write when reading RGB values in the `put1bitbwtile` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** The heap overflow can be leveraged to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Denial of service:** While not the primary impact, a crash due to the heap overflow is also a form of denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious TIFF file:** An attacker can craft a malicious TIFF image file with specific dimensions designed to trigger the integer overflow.
- **File or URL:** The attacker can provide this malicious file either directly or via a URL to a vulnerable application utilizing the Gdk-Pixbuf library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted TIFF file to a vulnerable application using Gdk-Pixbuf for image processing.
- No special privileges required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability specifically occurs when the library is compiled with Clang using `-O3` optimization flag. GCC, by default, does not remove the integer overflow checks, so is not affected in the same manner.
- The provided crash information shows that the crash occurs within `put1bitbwtile`, a function used to process image data, further indicating the out-of-bounds write.
- Debian states that their package is compiled with gcc and is not affected but they issued a patch for downstream users that could be affected.
