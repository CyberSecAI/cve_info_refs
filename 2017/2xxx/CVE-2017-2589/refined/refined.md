  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2017-2589",
    "description": "The hawtio servlet uses a single HttpClient instance to proxy requests with a persistent cookie store (cookies are stored locally and are not passed between the client and the end URL) which means all clients using that proxy are sharing the same cookies.",
    "affected_component": "hawtio",
    "root_cause": "The hawtio servlet uses a single HttpClient instance with a persistent cookie store for proxying requests.",
    "vulnerability": "Cookies are not isolated per client but shared, leading to potential cross-user data exposure.",
     "impact": "Cookie sharing among clients using the hawtio proxy. This could lead to session hijacking or unauthorized access to other users' resources if cookies contain session information or other sensitive data.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can potentially gain access to another user's session or resources by leveraging the shared cookies",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to use the hawtio proxy.",
