- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling URLs, allowing an attacker to specify a local file path in a crafted URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access and obtain local files from the server by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), involving sending a specially crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) but needs the user to interact with the malicious crafted URL (UI:R).
