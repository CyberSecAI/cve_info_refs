# JVN#55121369 CentreCOM AR260S V2 vulnerable to privilege escalation

## Overview

CentreCOM AR260S V2 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* CentreCOM AR260S V2

## Description

âCentreCOM AR260S V2 provided by Allied Telesis K.K. is a wired LAN router. CentreCOM AR260S V2 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability.

## Impact

Unintended operations may be performed with administrative privileges by a user who can log into the product with "guest" account.

## Solution

**Apply Workarounds**

The following workarounds may mitigate the impacts of this vulnerability.

* **Change the password of the account "guest"**

  The default password of the account "guest" is publicly known. Change the password of the account "guest" immediately to prevent an unauthenticated attacker from logging into the product.
* **Do not allow untrusted person to use the account "guest"**

  Once logged into the vulnerable product as "guest", this vulnerability can be exploited. Therefore do not allow untrusted person to use the "guest" account.
* **Enable the Firewall protection**

  The product has a firewall protection, and it is enabled by default.  Enable firewall to protect the product from unintended accesses from WAN side.
