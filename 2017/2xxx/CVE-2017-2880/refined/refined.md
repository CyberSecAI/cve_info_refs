- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A byte value taken directly from a GIF file is used to calculate a loop repeat number, leading to a memory corruption vulnerability and potential overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption, memory overflow due to insufficient bounds checking while parsing GIF files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution through memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted GIF file to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a malicious GIF file to the user who opens it with the vulnerable application (Computerinsel Photoline). The attacker does not need any special privileges.
