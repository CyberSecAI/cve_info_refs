Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2651:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Jenkins Mailer Plugin could send emails to dynamically created lists of users derived from changelogs (e.g., authors of SCM changes).
*   The mapping of email addresses to users was flawed, based on the local part of email addresses. This resulted in emails being sent to unintended recipients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Email Recipient Handling:** The plugin did not properly validate if email recipients were actually registered users within Jenkins.
*   **Incorrect Email Address Mapping:** The plugin used a weak/incorrect method for mapping email addresses to Jenkins users, potentially sending emails to people not involved in the project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Emails containing project-related information could be sent to individuals who are not authorized to access such data.
*   **Unintended Communication:**  Emails could be sent to recipients not intended to receive them, possibly exposing sensitive information and causing confusion.
*   While no direct access control bypass is mentioned, the vulnerability allowed for information leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Automated Trigger of Build Process**: The vulnerability would be triggered during the automated build process within Jenkins when the Mailer plugin is configured to notify committers or other changelog based recipients.
*   **SCM Commits**: By making a commit to the SCM, an attacker could influence the list of recipients based on the email addresses in their commits.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special access or privileges** on the Jenkins server are needed, a malicious actor could just be a committer to the SCM.
*   **Knowledge of Jenkins Configuration**: The attacker must have some knowledge of Jenkins configuration with the mailer plugin enabled and configured to send emails to the changelog-based recipient lists.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability also affects the Email Extension Plugin (CVE-2017-2654) because it shares a similar feature of sending emails to dynamically created user lists.
*   The fix involved updating the Mailer Plugin to version 1.20.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "low severity."
