The content is related to CVE-2017-2874.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `multicamera_p10001` function of the `devMng` binary, which handles incoming messages on UDP port 10001. Specifically, the function processes a "find" command (0x0000) without proper authentication. It retrieves sensitive information like the MAC address, camera name, and firmware version when this command is sent, leaking it in the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive information (MAC address, camera name, firmware version) without authentication.
- Lack of Authentication: The "find" command (0x0000) on port 10001 does not require any form of authentication.
- Insufficient Input Validation: While the code checks the length of the message, it doesn't validate the command, allowing the "find" command to be processed without any prior authentication check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information which can be used in further attacks. Specifically, the MAC address is needed for sending commands on port 10000, and this information disclosure can enable remote exploitation even outside the local network.
-  The disclosed information could be used to fingerprint devices, potentially enabling targeted attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exposed on UDP port 10001 and is reachable over the network.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted UDP packet containing the "find" command (0x0000) to port 10001 of the target Foscam camera.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to port 10001 of the vulnerable device.
- No prior authentication is needed.
- The attacker can be on the same network as the camera or potentially remotely, if port 10001 is exposed.
