The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2017-2786.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `DecodeString` function of the Pharos PopUp Printer Client's `psnotifyd` application. This function parses strings from network packets based on a length value also found in the packet. An attacker can manipulate this length value, causing the program to read beyond the bounds of allocated memory when processing subsequent data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125):** The `DecodeString` function does not properly validate the length of the string being read from the packet, allowing an attacker-controlled length value to cause a read beyond allocated memory.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code directly uses the provided length from the packet without proper checks for its validity, leading to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read leads to a crash of the `psnotifyd` application, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network packets:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the target machine running the vulnerable Pharos PopUp Printer Client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target machine running the vulnerable Pharos PopUp Printer Client. No specific privileges or authentication is needed.
