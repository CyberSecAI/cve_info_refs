  "cve": "CVE-2017-2612",
  "description": "Jenkins allows administrators to enter their username and password to the Oracle download site which provides JDKs for download. Users with read access to Jenkins were able to override these credentials, resulting in future builds possibly failing to download a JDK. A permission check has been added.",

    "root_cause": "Insufficient permission checks",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of credentials",
      "Lack of access control"

    "impact": "Low privilege users could override JDK download credentials, potentially causing builds to fail.",
    "attack_vector": "Users with read access to Jenkins could modify the JDK download credentials.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have read access to the Jenkins instance."

  "affected_versions": [
    "All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 2.43",
