- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The integrated web server on Port 10000/TCP of the RUGGEDCOM ROX I devices lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform actions with the privileges of an authenticated user. This can lead to unauthorized changes, data manipulation, and system compromise. The impact includes low confidentiality, high integrity, and low availability.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can induce a targeted user to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious website. The attacker relies on the user having an active session on the vulnerable device's web interface at Port 10000/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to lure the user into clicking on a crafted link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need prior access or authentication on the device. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
