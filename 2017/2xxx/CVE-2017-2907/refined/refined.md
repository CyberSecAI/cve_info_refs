Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Integer overflow in the `avi_format_convert` function when calculating buffer size for decoding an AVI frame.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of `movie->header->Height * movie->header->Width * 3` within the `avi_converter_from_avi_rgb` function is not checked for potential overflow. This allows the calculation result to wrap around, leading to a small or zero-sized memory allocation.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  After the undersized buffer is allocated, the application proceeds to copy data using `memcpy` into the undersized buffer in a loop, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** By overflowing the heap, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Blender application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious AVI File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted AVI file.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious AVI file, either by importing it as an asset or by directly loading the file with the Blender application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **File Creation:** An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted malicious AVI file.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open/load this malicious AVI file within Blender.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the `avi_converter_from_avi_rgb` function, which is called during AVI decoding.
- The dimensions (width and height) of the video, read from the AVI header, are used to calculate the buffer size. These dimensions can be manipulated to cause an integer overflow.
- The allocated buffer is too small for the data being copied to it resulting in a heap buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability is located within the open-source Blender 3d creation suite version 2.78c.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) is a python script that generates a malicious AVI file to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vendor was notified on 2017-09-06 and the public release was on 2018-01-11.
- Mitigation involves avoiding untrusted animation files within Blender projects.
- Debian also released security updates for this issue, indicating its presence in their packaged versions of Blender.
