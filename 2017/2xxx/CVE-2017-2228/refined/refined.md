The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2228.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by the "Teikihoukokusho Sakuseishien Tool." Specifically, the tool is susceptible to DLL hijacking because it does not specify the full path to the DLLs it loads and instead relies on the DLL search path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Improper DLL loading mechanism (CWE-427)
-  DLL hijacking vulnerability: The application loads DLLs from the same directory, making it vulnerable to loading a malicious DLL with the same name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable tool.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker places a malicious DLL file in the same directory as the tool's executable.
-  The user must then execute the tool, which then loads the malicious DLL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious DLL in the same directory as the application. This could be achieved through social engineering, or through compromising the userâ€™s system.
- The attacker would need to know the name of the DLL being loaded by the application.
- The attacker has to trick the user into running the application after placing the malicious DLL.

**Additional Details**
- The tool is distributed as a ZIP archive, and it is expected that the user will extract it to their home directory. This exacerbates the vulnerability, as the tool's directory is writable by the user.
- The fix involves installing the tool in the system area, reducing the risk of an attacker being able to place a malicious DLL in the tool's directory.
- CVSS v3 score: 7.8 (High), CVSS v2 score: 6.8 (Medium).
