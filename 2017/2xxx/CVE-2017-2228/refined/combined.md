# JVN#53292345 Teikihoukokusho Sakuseishien Tool may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries

## Overview

Teikihoukokusho Sakuseishien Tool provided by Agency for Natural Resources and Energy of Ministry of Economy,Trade and Industry (METI) may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.

## Products Affected

* Teikihoukokusho Sakuseishien Tool v4.0

## Description

Teikihoukokusho Sakuseishien Tool provided by Agency for Natural Resources and Energy of METI contains an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).

The tool is provided as a ZIP archive. It is assumed that a user extracts the tool (the executable file) to the home directory. If a malicious DLL file is placed in the same directory as the tool and the user invokes the tool, then the malicious DLL is loaded and executed.

## Impact

Arbitrary code may be executed with the privilege of the user invoking the tool.

## Solution

**Use the latest software**

Use the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

Teikihoukokusho Sakuseishien Tool v4.1 is installed on the system area of the computer. Therefore, the risk of a malicious DLL file being placed to the tool's directory by an attacker or by a tricked user, is decreased.
