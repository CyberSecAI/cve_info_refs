Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `memcmp()` in the `MitCheckCookie()` function within the Xorg server to compare received MIT cookies against a list of valid cookies. Standard implementations of `memcmp()` often return as soon as a mismatch is found. This behavior creates a timing difference between comparisons of correct and incorrect bytes, which is exploitable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The primary vulnerability is a timing side-channel attack. Due to the variable execution time of `memcmp()`, an attacker can deduce information about the correct cookie by observing the time it takes for the function to execute with different inputs.
- **Use of non-constant time `memcmp()`:** The core weakness is the use of a `memcmp()` implementation that does not perform the comparison in constant time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful timing attack could allow a local attacker to bypass authentication and attach to another user's Xorg session. This would grant the attacker the privileges of the target user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack must be carried out locally, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the local machine where the Xorg server is running.
- **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs to be able to reliably measure the execution time of the `MitCheckCookie()` function.
- **Knowledge of the MIT Cookie:** The attacker does not necessarily know the correct MIT cookie in advance but can brute-force it through the timing information.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory notes that the optimized `memcmp()` implementation on a standard Linux system may not exhibit a significant timing difference, and X41 was only able to measure a difference using a naive implementation. However, they point to successful timing attacks in other contexts as evidence this is still an issue that should be addressed.
- The fix for this vulnerability involved replacing the vulnerable `memcmp()` with a timing-safe `memcmp()` implementation (`timingsafe_memcmp()`).
- The advisory also notes that other projects like OpenSSL use timing-safe `memcmp()` for similar tasks.
