- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when creating a file path using `makepath` with a client-controlled string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
    - Lack of input validation on the size of the client-supplied `Data.Name` string.
    - Use of `makepath` function without ensuring the resulting string fits the destination buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution by overwriting exception handlers on the stack.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted network packet containing a `SavePatientMontage` command with a `Data.Name` value exceeding the stack buffer's capacity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable Natus Xltek NeuroWorks application. The attacker does not need any authentication.
