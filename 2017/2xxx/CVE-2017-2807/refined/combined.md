# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0303

## Ledger CLI Tags Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability

##### August 30, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2807

### Summary

An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tag parsing functionality of Ledger-CLI 3.1.1. A specially crafted journal file can cause a integer underflow resulting in code execution. An attacker can construct a malicious journal file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Ledger CLI 3.1.1

### Product URLs

<http://ledger-cli.org>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)

### Details

Ledger CLI is an accounting system accessed via the command line. Ledger leverages data provided by the user to provide very detailed financial reports and analytics.

When parsing the tags in a journal file, a size of the tag is constructed by subtracting two pointers pointing to the ends of the tag. This size is used directly to copy file data into a static buffer. This subtraction can result in an integer underflow, forcing a large value to be be used in the subsequent `strnpcy`.

```
src/items.cc:147

void item_t::parse_tags(const char * p,
                        scope_t&     scope,
                        bool         overwrite_existing)
{
if (! std::strchr(p, ':')) {
    if (const char * b = std::strchr(p, '[')) {
        if (*(b + 1) != '\0' &&
            (std::isdigit(*(b + 1)) || *(b + 1) == '=')) {
            if (const char * e = std::strchr(p, ']')) {
                char buf[256];
                std::strncpy(buf ,b + 1, static_cast<std::size_t>(e - b - 1));

```

An example journal file exercising this vulnerability is shown below:

```
$ cat poc.dat
2003/12/20 Organic Co-op
  Expenses:Food:Groceries             $ 37.50  ; ] [=2004/01/01]

```

Note the `]` that comes before `[` after the `;`. These resultant pointers cause the integer overflow resulting in the buffer overflow.

This does not mean that openSUSE is not affected. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1052484#c2)  Tomáš Chvátal   2019-07-11 11:16:14 UTC  ``` This is automated batch bugzilla cleanup.  The openSUSE 42.3 changed to end-of-life (EOL [1]) status. As such it is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  openSUSE (At this moment openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.0 and Tumbleweed) please feel free to reopen this bug against that version (!you must update the "Version" component in the bug fields, do not just reopen please), or alternatively create a new ticket.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed during the lifetime of the release.
