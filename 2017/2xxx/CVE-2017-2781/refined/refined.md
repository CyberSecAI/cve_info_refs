- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap buffer overflow exists in the X.509 certificate parsing within the `parsePolicyMappings` function of InsideSecure MatrixSSL. The vulnerability is due to a mismatch between the allocated buffer size and the actual number of OIDs copied into the buffer when parsing the `IssuerDomainPolicy` extension. Specifically, the size of the allocated buffer is determined by the length of ASN1 OID field (`len`), while the number of OIDs to be copied is determined by the actual count of parsed OIDs (`oidlen`), which can be larger.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) in the parsing of X.509 certificate extensions.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution is possible through a crafted X.509 certificate presented during a secure connection, leading to a heap buffer overflow. This allows an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the presentation of a specially crafted X.509 certificate to a vulnerable client or server application during the establishment of a secure connection. The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the `IssuerDomainPolicy` extension.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to present a malicious X.509 certificate to a server or client using the vulnerable MatrixSSL library. This likely means the attacker is in a position to initiate a secure connection with the targeted system or to inject the malicious certificate into the communication path.
