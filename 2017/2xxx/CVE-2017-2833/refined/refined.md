{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The webService binary constructs a command string using user-provided username and password without sanitizing them before passing it to the system call. This occurs during the FTP server configuration during boot.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection (CWE-78). Lack of input sanitization of user-controlled parameters before passing them to `system()` call.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device during boot process.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the device's web management interface to change a user's password or add a new user, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the username or password field. Rebooting the device will trigger the execution of the injected command during the boot process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to send an HTTP request to the device and reboot it. Attacker needs to have a valid user account to change the password or needs to be able to add a new account."
