- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Huawei Themes app lacks proper checks on theme packs, allowing arbitrary file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of theme packs, allowing an attacker to upload malicious files disguised as theme files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick users into installing malicious themes containing arbitrary code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious theme pack containing executable files, then tricks the user to install this crafted theme pack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to create a malicious theme package and trick a user into installing it on their device. Physical access to the device is not required, as the theme can likely be distributed through online channels.
