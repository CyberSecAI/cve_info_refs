- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer for "The JPKI user's software" has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading due to a flawed DLL search path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** Local. An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer would load it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched by the installer's DLL loading mechanism, and the user would need to execute the vulnerable installer. The user would need to initiate the installation process.
