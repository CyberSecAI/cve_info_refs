# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0364

## Natus Xltek EEG NeuroWorks Invalid KeyTree Entry Denial-of-Service Vulnerability

##### May 31, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2860

### Summary

An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the lookup entry functionality of KeyTrees in Natus Xltek NeuroWorks 8. A specially crafted network packet can cause an out-of-bounds read, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Natus Xltek NeuroWorks 8

### Product URLs

[http://www.natus.com](http://www.natus.com/index.cfm?page=products_1&crid=224)

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read

### Details

Natus NeuroWorks 8 provides a networking solution for the Natus Xltek EEG products. In particular, it is used to monitor and review study data from anywhere on the network. This advisory looks into the NWStorage service bundled with NeuroWorks.

The module used in this advisory is shown below:

```
0:000> lm vm List
start    end        module name
23000000 23012000   List       (export symbols)       c:\Neuroworks\List.dll
    Loaded symbol image file: c:\Neuroworks\List.dll
    Image path: c:\Neuroworks\List.dll
    Image name: List.dll
    Timestamp:        Wed Nov 06 09:58:18 2013 (527A833A)
    CheckSum:         0001779F
    ImageSize:        00012000
    File version:     8.0.1.1544
    Product version:  8.0.1.1544

```

One of the key data structures in Neuroworks is the KeyTree. Internally, a KeyTree is a list of lists. The list and KeyTree structs are shown below:

```
KeyTree/List
char opcode; // 5 for KeyTree, 4 for ItemList
int num_elements ; // Number of elements in this KeyTree
Item[num_elements] items; // List of elements

```

Python pseudocode for this construct for a valid KeyTree is shown below:

```
keytree = clkeytree([
                    clitemlist([clstr("Connections\0")]),
                    clitemlist([clstr("Client\0")]),
                    clitemlist([clstr("ProcessId\0", 0x1234)]),
                    clitemlist([clstr("Study\0"), study]),
                    ])

```

Above, we see a KeyTree with a key of `Connections.Client.ProcessId` with value of 0x1234, as well as a key of `study` with a value of `study` (which would be defined elsewhere). The key feature here is that the KeyTree assumes that each of its elements is an `ItemList`.

One component of the traversal of the the KeyTree is shown below:

```
List.dll
.text:2300447A 024                 mov     eax, [esi+14h]  // Esi - KeyTree struct
.text:2300447D 024                 test    eax, eax        // Eax - first ItemList in the KeyTree
.text:2300447F 024                 jz      loc_2300461F
.text:23004485 024                 lea     this, [eax+14h] // Retrieve `next value` from the ItemList
.text:23004488 024                 call    ds:ATL::CSimpleStringT<char,1>::operator char const *(void)

```

This snippet shows the beginning of the retrieval of the value in the first element of the first itemlist in a KeyTree. This code assumes that the first element of a KeyTree is an itemlist. If the first element of the KeyTree is a string data structure, for instance, the dereference at `0x23004485` doesn’t necessarily point to a valid memory address. Passing an invalid address to the function at `0x23004488` will cause a crash of Neuroworks, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. For example with pseudocode, replacing the valid pseudocode above, will trigger this vulnerability.

```
keytree = clkeytree([
                        clstr('A' * 4)
                    ])

```
