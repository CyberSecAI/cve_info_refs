Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2472:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists within the XNU kernel due to a double release of a port in the `posix_spawn` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free:** A memory location is freed and then accessed again, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Double-free:** A memory location is freed more than once, leading to corruption of heap metadata.
- Specifically in the `exec_handle_port_actions`, the vulnerability occurs when handling the xnu port actions extension to `posix_spawn`. The `audit_session_spawnjoin` function drops a reference on the port on failure, but the main function also drops a reference, causing the double-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.
- The exploit PoC demonstrates a denial of service (DoS), indicating system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local exploitation via a malicious application.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `posix_spawn` is called with a specially crafted audit session port.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the targeted system.
- The attacker needs the ability to create and set audit session ports in a `posix_spawn` call.
