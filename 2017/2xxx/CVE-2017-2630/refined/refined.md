  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) while processing the server's response to a 'NBD_OPT_LIST' request. The comparison symbol was misused, leading to memory corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack buffer overflow (CWE-121)"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious NBD server could exploit this flaw to crash a remote NBD client, leading to a denial of service (DoS). It could also potentially allow for arbitrary code execution on the client host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious NBD server sends a crafted response to a 'NBD_OPT_LIST' request."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the NBD server that the QEMU client is connecting to. No user interaction is required on the client side, and low privileges are sufficient.",
       "addtional_information": "The vulnerability is located in the `drop_sync` function within the NBD client implementation. The issue was introduced in commit 7d3123e and fixed in commit 2563c9c of the QEMU project. The fix involves correcting a comparison symbol to avoid a stack buffer overflow during the processing of server response."
