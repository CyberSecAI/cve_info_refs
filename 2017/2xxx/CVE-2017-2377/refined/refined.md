**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Closing a window while paused in the debugger may lead to an unexpected application termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing maliciously crafted web content. This would involve an attacker crafting a webpage specifically designed to trigger the vulnerability within WebKit's debugging tools.
