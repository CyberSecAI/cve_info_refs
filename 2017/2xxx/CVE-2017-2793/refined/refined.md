The content is related to CVE-2017-2793.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `UnCompressUnicode` function of AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter, specifically within the processing of XLS files. The `UnCompressUnicode` function is called when processing string objects in XLS files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The `UnCompressUnicode` function lacks proper bounds checking when processing Unicode strings, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The size of the string is not validated against the allocated buffer size. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated heap memory region, causing a heap corruption.
- Insufficient input validation: The `String` function fails to validate the `cch` value which specifies the length of the string. This allows an attacker to specify an excessively large string length value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: The heap corruption can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the target system.
- Program crash: The buffer overflow leads to memory corruption, causing the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious XLS file: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted XLS file to the affected software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XLS file to the application that uses the vulnerable AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter library.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- User interaction is required as the user must open the malformed XLS document.
