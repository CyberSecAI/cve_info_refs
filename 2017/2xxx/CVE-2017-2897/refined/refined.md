Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2897:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `read_MSAT` function of the `libxls` library. Specifically, there's a lack of bounds checking when writing to the `ole2->SecID` buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The code calculates an offset into the `ole2->SecID` buffer without ensuring it remains within the allocated buffer's boundaries. This allows writing data beyond the buffer's allocated memory.
*   The size of `ole2->SecID` is determined by `ole2->cfat` (read from the malicious file) and `ole2->lsector` (fixed size) while the amount of data written to the buffer is based on `(ole2->lsector-4)/4`, leading to an inconsistency that can be controlled by manipulating `cfat`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The out-of-bounds write leads to heap memory corruption. This can be leveraged by an attacker to overwrite memory with malicious data, which can be further exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Denial of Service:** As seen in the crash information, the memory corruption can also cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XLS File:** An attacker creates a specially crafted XLS file that exploits the vulnerability in `libxls`. This file could be distributed via email, web download or other means.
*   **Processing by vulnerable software:** When a vulnerable application, such as one using the `readxl` R package, processes this malicious XLS file, the vulnerability can be triggered leading to code execution or application crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send malicious file:** The attacker needs to be able to send or make the malicious XLS file available to a user who then processes it using the vulnerable software.
*   **User interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious XLS file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `libxls` version 1.4.
*   The `readxl` package for R was also found to be vulnerable when using the vulnerable `libxls`.
*   The `cfat` value, which influences the buffer size, is read directly from the malicious file.
*   The Talos report includes a crash analysis in both Microsoft R and directly in `libxls`.

This vulnerability is considered to have a high severity due to the potential for remote code execution.
