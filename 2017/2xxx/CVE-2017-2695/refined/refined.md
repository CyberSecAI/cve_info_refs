- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in Huawei smartphones, specifically within the email application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability that is exploited by manipulating a specific URI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can obtain files from the email application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into installing a malicious application. This application is then used to change a URI to access the arbitrary file system directories.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to create a malicious application and trick the user into installing it on their Huawei smartphone.
