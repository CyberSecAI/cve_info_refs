Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2784:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an invalid free of a stack pointer within the x509 certificate parsing code of ARM mbedTLS. Specifically, this occurs during the processing of elliptic curve cryptographic keys, when a crafted x509 certificate is supplied.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Pointer Free:** The core issue is that the `mbedtls_mpi_grow` function attempts to free memory pointed to by `X->p`. However, under certain circumstances (specifically when parsing a crafted X.509 certificate using the secp224k1 curve), `X->p` is assigned a stack address, leading to an invalid free.
- **Improper Memory Management:**  The code incorrectly uses stack allocated memory in a context that can result in calling `free()` on it. The specific flaw is in the function `ecp_mod_koblitz` where a stack variable is assigned to a pointer, which is freed later using the `mbedtls_free` wrapper.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** The invalid free can corrupt memory and potentially lead to remote code execution, especially on embedded platforms that may lack modern heap exploitation mitigations.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash caused by the invalid free can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by delivering a malicious x509 certificate to a vulnerable application acting as either a client or a server.
- **Malicious Certificate:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted x509 certificate is parsed by mbedTLS. This certificate includes a malformed public key using `secp224k1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious x509 certificate to a vulnerable mbedTLS application. This could be as part of a client-server interaction.
- **Crafted Certificate:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious x509 certificate to trigger the vulnerability. The supplied certificate specifies a curve of type `secp224k1` that triggers the flawed logic.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in ARM mbedTLS version 2.4.0.
- The issue was addressed in mbedTLS version 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the verification of the public key within the certificate.
