Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The installer of Charamin OMP has an issue with its DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries. This is a classic case of a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer doesn't properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is local. The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer will load it. The document suggests the attacker must trick the user into placing this malicious DLL file in a specific folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have the ability to write files to a location where the installer searches for DLLs. This could be achieved if the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder, as indicated in the document.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges initially but can gain the privileges of the user running the installer.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into placing the malicious DLL file to achieve code execution.
