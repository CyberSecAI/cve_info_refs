Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The installer for the Douro Kouji Kanseizutou Check Program insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). This is due to an issue with the DLL search path used by the installer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure DLL loading:** The installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking/preloading. It doesn't properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files. This falls under CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer searches for DLLs. When the installer runs, it will load the malicious DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer. This could allow the attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a directory where the installer searches for DLLs. The specific location is not explicitly specified, but it's implied to be within the same directory as `setup.exe` after extracting the installer.
- **User interaction:** The user must execute the installer for the exploit to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs some form of write access on the local file system to place the malicious DLL in the appropriate location.
- **User Deception:** The attacker needs to trick the user into running the vulnerable installer (`setup.exe`).

**Additional Details:**

- The provided text states that only the installer is vulnerable.
- The affected versions are Douro Kouji Kanseizutou Check Program Ver3.1.2 (cdrw\_checker\_3.1.2.zip) and earlier.
- The fix involves using the latest installer (Ver3.1.3) and verifying that there are no extra files in the installer's "setup program" directory besides `setup.exe`.
- The provided CVSS scores (v3: 7.8 and v2: 6.8) indicate a high severity vulnerability.
- JPCERT/CC provides additional context, stating that the analysis assumes that the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file prepared by the attacker in a specific folder.
