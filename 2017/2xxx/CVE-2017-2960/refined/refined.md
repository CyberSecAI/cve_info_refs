Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the ImageConversion's JPEG parsing functionality of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The process fails to properly validate user-supplied data, leading to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to improper validation of user-supplied data during JPEG parsing.
*  **Memory Corruption:** The Adobe bulletin classifies this as a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the vulnerable system.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While this vulnerability on its own only leads to information disclosure, the advisory states that it can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote attackers.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically, the target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file. This implies the attacker must entice the user to perform one of those actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious JPEG:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious JPEG file or host a malicious web page that can trigger the vulnerability when parsed by Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must rely on social engineering to convince the user to either open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC and is addressed by an update.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via filter ID '26512'.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 4.3, with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N. This indicates a network-based attack vector with medium attack complexity, no authentication required, a potential for partial information disclosure, and no impact on integrity or availability.
