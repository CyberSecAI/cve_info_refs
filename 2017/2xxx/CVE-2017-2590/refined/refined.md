  "CVE-2017-2590": {
    "description": "It was found that IdM's ca-del, ca-disable, and ca-enable commands did not properly check the user's permissions while modifying CAs in Dogtag. An authenticated, unauthorized attacker could use this flaw to delete, disable, or enable CAs causing various denial of service problems with certificate issuance, OCSP signing, and deletion of secret keys.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient permission checks in the `ca-del`, `ca-disable`, and `ca-enable` commands when modifying Certificate Authorities (CAs) in Dogtag.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Missing authorization checks"
      ],
       "impact": "An authenticated, but unauthorized user can delete, disable, or enable CAs. This can lead to denial of service conditions, including: problems with certificate issuance, OCSP signing, and deletion of secret keys.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the vulnerable Identity Management server."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a valid user on the Identity Management (IdM) system, although lacking the necessary permissions for ca management. No specific level of access beyond valid credentials is required."
