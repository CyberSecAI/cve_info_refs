Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-2136

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the "WP Statistics" WordPress plugin processes HTTP Referer headers. This improper processing allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS (CWE-79). Malicious scripts injected through the Referer header are stored and then executed when a user accesses affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they view a page where the malicious script is stored. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Referer Header:** The attack vector is through the manipulation of the HTTP Referer header.
*   **Multiple Pages:** The vulnerability is present in multiple pages within the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted Referer header to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication:** The CVSS v3 score indicates that no privileges are required to perform the attack
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must visit a page containing the stored malicious script for it to be executed.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects WP Statistics versions 12.0.4 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gen Sato of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
*   The vendor has released a fix in version 12.0.5.
*   The vulnerability is distinct from JVN#77253951.
