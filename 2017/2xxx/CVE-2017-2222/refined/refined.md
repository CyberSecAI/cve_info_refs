### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html))

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker could inject arbitrary scripts into a logged-in user's browser, which can lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on their behalf without their consent.

### Attack vectors
The attack vector is network-based, and the attacker could inject malicious scripts through a crafted input. User interaction is required as the user will need to view the page with the injected script for it to be executed.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker does not need to be authenticated and must have the ability to inject a script into a location within the application where it can be executed by another logged-in user. This would indicate an area where the plugin renders user-supplied input without proper sanitization/escaping.
