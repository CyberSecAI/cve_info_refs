- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write in the .PSD parsing functionality of ACDSee Ultimate 10.0.0.292. A size value read directly from a PSD file is used as an argument to the memmove function without proper validation, which leads to a memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The application doesn't validate the size argument taken from the file before using it in a `memmove` operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially achieve code execution by sending a specially crafted .PSD file that triggers the out-of-bounds write, leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted .PSD file to the user of the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious .PSD file to a user who opens it with the vulnerable version of ACDSee Ultimate 10. The attacker does not need any specific privileges or position, but requires user interaction (opening the malicious file).
