- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `DCTStream::getBlock` function within Lexmark's modified version of the Poppler library (libISYSpdf6.so). This is due to an integer underflow when calculating the size of the memory to copy, based on user-controlled `blockBuf` and `blockBufEnd` pointers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack-based buffer overflow (`CWE-121`).
    - Incorrect handling of image data buffers within the `DCTStream` class (specifically, the `IGRStream` subclass).
    - User-controlled pointers (`blockBuf` and `blockBufEnd`) used in memory copy operation.
    - Integer underflow when calculating the size of data to be copied.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution vulnerability leading to arbitrary code execution due to stack overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** A maliciously crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the Lexmark Perceptive Document Filters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to create or modify PDF files.
    - User interaction to process the malicious PDF using the vulnerable software.
