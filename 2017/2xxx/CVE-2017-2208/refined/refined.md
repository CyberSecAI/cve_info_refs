- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer for the electronic tendering and bid opening system has an insecure search path for executable files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The installer does not properly validate the location of executable files it invokes, leading to the potential execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If exploited, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to trick a user into placing a malicious executable file in a specific location where the installer will then pick it up and execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have the ability to place a malicious file on the user's system in a location that will be accessed by the installer. The user needs to run the installer.
