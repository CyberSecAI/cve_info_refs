- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The goldeneye driver in some Huawei smartphones lacks proper parameter checks, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can crash the system or escalate user privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs root privileges on the Android system. They must trick a user into installing a malicious application on the smartphone, and then send specific parameters to the phone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have root privileges on the Android system and needs to convince a user to install a malicious application.
