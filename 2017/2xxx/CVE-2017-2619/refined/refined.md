{
  "CVE-2017-2619": {
    "Root cause": "A race condition exists in the samba server when handling symlinks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Time-of-check, time-of-use race condition",
      "Improper symlink handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious client can exploit the race condition to bypass the exported share path and access files and directories outside of the defined share, potentially leading to unauthorized access and information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via a malicious Samba client that has write access to the share."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a second SMB connection to the same share with write access to the exported file system."
  }
}
