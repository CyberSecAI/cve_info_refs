- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the insecure search path used by AppCheck and its installer when invoking executable files. This means the application might load a malicious executable from a location controlled by the attacker instead of the intended one.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper search path for executable files (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running AppCheck or the installer. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local and relies on tricking a user into placing a malicious executable file in a location where AppCheck or its installer will find and execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable file on the victim's system in a location where it can be accessed by the vulnerable application. The attacker must also rely on user interaction to trigger the execution of the vulnerable application.
