Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-2963:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Acrobat Pro DC parses TIFF images. Specifically, the `ImageConversion` module does not properly validate user-supplied data when parsing TIFF files. This lack of validation can lead to a write past the end of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability due to the out-of-bounds write when parsing a malicious TIFF image. This specific vulnerability is a *memory corruption vulnerability that could lead to code execution*.
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to validate user-supplied data during TIFF parsing. This results in writing past the boundary of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to disclose sensitive information.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** Although the advisory directly states that it results in information disclosure, it also notes that this out-of-bounds write can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **User interaction required:** The attack requires user interaction, meaning a user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (containing the crafted TIFF image).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Ability to craft malicious TIFF image:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious TIFF image file that triggers the out-of-bounds write.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to induce a victim to open the malicious TIFF file, or visit a webpage that does so via a document or other embedding method.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2016-11-30, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2017-01-10.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
* Adobe released a security update to address this issue.
