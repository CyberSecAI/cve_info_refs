Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stemmed from an issue in how iOS handled "tel" URLs within PDF documents specifically in Quick Look. Tapping on such a link could initiate a phone call without prompting the user for confirmation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of user confirmation before initiating a phone call through a "tel" link.
-  Improper validation of "tel" URLs in Quick Look.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could embed a malicious "tel" link within a PDF document that, when opened and tapped by a user, would automatically trigger a call to a specified number.
-  This could be abused to initiate calls to emergency numbers (911), potentially causing a denial-of-service condition at emergency call centers by flooding them with calls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor could craft a PDF document containing a "tel" link.
- The malicious PDF document would need to be opened on a vulnerable iOS device and the user would need to tap on the "tel" link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create or have access to a PDF document and embed the malicious link in the document.
- The attacker needs to distribute or cause the vulnerable user to open the crafted PDF document on a vulnerable iOS device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in iOS 10.3 by adding a confirmation prompt before a call is initiated through a "tel" link. This mitigates the risk of unintentional or malicious calls being placed.
- The vulnerability is described in the context of Quick Look and PDF documents.
