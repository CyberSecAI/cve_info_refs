Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2527:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `CAMediaTimingFunctionBuiltin` class in QuartzCore, specifically in the `initWithCoder:` method.
- This method reads an integer value ("index") from the input data.
- This index is then used to access an array of function pointers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The code does not validate if the provided "index" is within the bounds of the function pointer array. This allows an attacker to supply an out-of-bounds index.
- **Memory Corruption:** If the index is out of bounds, the code will read from an arbitrary memory location and attempt to treat it as an objective-c object.
- This leads to memory corruption when the objective-c `retain` selector is called on this invalid pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, the official description from Apple indicates that processing the crafted data may lead to arbitrary code execution. The retain call on an invalid memory location could cause a crash or overwrite data leading to this. The exploit description notes this as a "Denial of Service" which is a low impact result if only crashing the process.
- **Denial of Service:** A more direct impact is a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted serialized data stream (likely using `NSKeyedArchiver`). The provided proof of concept is a serialized data with an index of 12345678.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted data stream to an application using the vulnerable `CAMediaTimingFunctionBuiltin` class.
- This typically involves exploiting some means of loading user-provided data, e.g., reading from a file.
- The vulnerability is platform-specific impacting macOS and iOS devices.
