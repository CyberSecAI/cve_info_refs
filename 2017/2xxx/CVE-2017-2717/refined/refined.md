- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow due to an illegal length field in a response message sent to the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to an integer overflow and subsequent restart of the modem system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be able to access the device's network and send a crafted response message with an illegal length field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
