{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A logic issue existed in the handling of strict mode functions in WebKit. When a built-in function in strict mode calls a non-strict function, that non-strict function is allowed to access `Function.caller` to obtain a reference to the strict function. This behavior is inconsistent with how non-builtin scripts are handled and other browser behaviors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Improper access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. By obtaining a reference to a native function, sanitization of input parameters can be bypassed, allowing for memory corruption or other unintended behaviors leading to code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web content"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create malicious web content that exploits this vulnerability. The attacker would also need to know or figure out offsets in memory for their specific target."
