Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the Panasonic Home unit KX-HJB1000.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
    *   Obtain information from the product's database.
    *   Alter information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based, indicated by `AV:N` in the CVSS vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to log into the affected product, which requires a user account with login privileges (indicated by `PR:H` for high privileges in the CVSS v3 vector and `Au:S` for single authentication in CVSS v2). This suggests that the vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated users.
