Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability allows access to files outside the intended directory of the CubeCart application.
- This is caused by insufficient validation of user input related to file paths, leading to directory traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker (with administrative privileges) can potentially access local files on the server that are outside of CubeCart's directory structure.
- This access can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in CubeCart to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).
- The vulnerability is present in CubeCart versions prior to 6.1.5.
- The vendor released version 6.1.5 to address this issue.
- The CVSS v3 score is 4.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a network-based attack with low complexity, requiring high privileges, no user interaction, and resulting in a change in scope with low confidentiality impact.
- The CVSS v2 score is 4.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N), indicating a network-based attack with low complexity, requiring single authentication, and resulting in partial confidentiality impact.
