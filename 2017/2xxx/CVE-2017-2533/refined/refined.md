        "CVE_ID": "CVE-2017-2533",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Time-of-check time-of-use race condition vulnerability.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The diskarbitrationd service lacks proper validation of paths prior to using them. It checks if a user owns the mount point, but a symlink can be created after the check and before the mount, allowing mounting on directories not owned by the user.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Local attackers can escalate privileges to root. By mounting a disk partition over any non-SIP protected directory, arbitrary files can be placed and executed with root privileges.",
        "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system with the ability to execute low-privileged code is required.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute code as a local user and have access to the Disk Arbitration IPC interface, which is accessible from within the Safari sandbox."
