- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper design of the Safe key database in the Files app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Brute-force password cracking vulnerability. The safe key database can be accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could access sensitive database information and crack users' Safe passwords, leading to information leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to get the Safe database to exploit the vulnerability. The document does not explicitly specify how the attacker gets the database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to obtain the Safe database. No other specific capabilities or positions are specified.
