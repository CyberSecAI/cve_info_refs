Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure DLL loading practice in self-extracting archive files created by `7-ZIP32.DLL`. Specifically, the DLL search path used by these archives is not properly secured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The self-extracting archives created by the vulnerable `7-ZIP32.DLL` version are susceptible to DLL hijacking or planting. The program does not properly validate the location from where it is loading DLL files, which allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the archive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the self-extracting archive file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in the same directory as the vulnerable self-extracting archive file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as a vulnerable self-extracting archive file. 
- The user must then execute the vulnerable archive.
- User interaction is required (the user has to run the malicious self-extracting archive)

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects self-extracting archives created by `7-ZIP32.DLL` version 9.22.00.01 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is similar to a previous issue in "7-Zip for Windows" regarding arbitrary DLL loading.
- The vulnerability was reported to JPCERT/CC by Eili Masami of Tachibana Lab.
