# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0398

## Cesanta Mongoose HTTP Server CGI Remote Code Execcution Vulnerability

##### October 31, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2891

### Summary

An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the HTTP server implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. An ordinary HTTP POST request with a CGI target can cause a reuse of previously freed pointer potentially resulting in remote code execution. An attacker needs to send this HTTP request over network to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Cesanta Mongoose 6.8

### Product URLs

<https://cesanta.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-416: Use After Free

### Details

Mongoose is a monolithic library implementing a number of networking protocols, including HTTP, MQTT, MDNS and others. It is designed with embedded devices in mind and as such is used in many IoT devices and runs on virtually all platforms.

While parsing a specific type of POST request that targets a CGI script, a use-after-free vulnerability is triggered, if compiled with CGI support which is the default. When doing the initial parsing, a structure of type `mg_connection` is allocated in function `mg_create_connection_base`. Then, while working on a reply and since this is a CGI request (target of the request just needs to end with set CGI extension, “.cgi” by default), a CGI handler is invoked in the function `mg_send_http_file`:

```
} else if (is_cgi) {
#if MG_ENABLE_HTTP_CGI
 mg_handle_cgi(nc, index_file ? index_file : path, path_info, hm, opts);
#else

```

In function `mg_handle_cgi` a new connection structure is allocated and a previous one is added to it:
struct mg\_connection \*cgi\_nc =
mg\_add\_sock(nc->mgr, fds[0], mg\_cgi\_ev\_handler); [1]
struct mg\_http\_proto\_data \*cgi\_pd = mg\_http\_get\_proto\_data(nc);

cgi\_pd->cgi.cgi\_nc = cgi\_nc;
cgi\_pd->cgi.cgi\_nc->user\_data = nc; [2]
nc->flags |= MG\_F\_USER\_1;

In above code, at [1], a new connection structure is created and at [2], the old `nc` is set as the `user_data` field. Since the initial client connection is deemed done, it’s being cleaned and the first `mg_connection` structure is freed by calling `mg_close_conn` in function `mg_socket_if_poll`. This leaves the `cgi_pd->cgi.cgi_nc->user_data` pointer set at [2] pointing to freed memory. Then, when executing the actual CGI event handler function `mg_cgi_ev_handler` this freed data will be accessed in different places depending on the event:

```
static void mg_cgi_ev_handler(struct mg_connection *cgi_nc, int ev,
                           void *ev_data) {
 struct mg_connection *nc = (struct mg_connection *) cgi_nc->user_data; [3]

...
  case MG_EV_CLOSE:
   mg_http_free_proto_data_cgi(&mg_http_get_proto_data(nc)->cgi); [4]
   nc->flags |= MG_F_SEND_AND_CLOSE;
   Break;

```

In the above code, at [3] the pointer to the original connection structure is retrieved (which at this time points to freed memory) and is dereferenced at [4] which ultimately leads to read and write over unallocated memory. If a second request happens at the right time, this freed memory might contain different data or point to other structures leading to server crash and potential remote code execution with multiple carefully controlled post requests.

This vulnerability can be demonstrated via the example web server application supplied with the library. Since the server may not immediately crash, the vulnerability can be observed by running the server under memory debugger such as valgrind or AddressSanitizer.
