- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installers for the specified software have an issue with the DLL search path, which can lead to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427). The installers do not properly validate the location from which they load DLL files, making them vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) because the attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it from. The user must run the installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder where the installer will load it from and the user would need to run the installer. The attacker needs low privileges (PR:N) and user interaction is required (UI:R).
