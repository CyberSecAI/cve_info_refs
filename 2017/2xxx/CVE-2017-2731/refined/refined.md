- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vibrator service of some Huawei smartphones lacks parameter checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation in the vibrator service interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker must trick a user into installing a malicious application on the smartphone.
    - The malicious application sends a crafted parameter to the smartphone's vibrator service interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to create and distribute a malicious application.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user to install the application.
