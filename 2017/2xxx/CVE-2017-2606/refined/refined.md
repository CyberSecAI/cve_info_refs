{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `Jenkins#getItems()` method had a performance optimization that bypassed permission checks for anonymous users when the 'Logged in users can do anything' authorization strategy was enabled, and anonymous access was disabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
       "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Anonymous users could potentially obtain a list of all items (e.g. jobs) within Jenkins, which should not be visible without proper authentication and authorization, leading to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "Accessing the internal API via an `UnprotectedRootAction` as an anonymous user.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker (anonymous user) able to access the Jenkins instance."
