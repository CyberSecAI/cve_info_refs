Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error exists in the `SIOCGIFORDER` ioctl handler within the kernel. Specifically, the check at (c) in the provided code snippet uses `>`, which should be `>=`, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Off-by-one error:** The conditional check `if (cursor > count_to_copy)` uses the wrong operator causing `ordered_indices[cursor] = ifp->if_index;` to write one byte outside the allocated memory
- **Memory Corruption:** Writing outside allocated memory leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The exploit can cause a crash by corrupting memory, effectively leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local application:** A malicious application running on the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the affected system.
- The attacker must be able to make `ioctl` calls to the `SIOCGIFORDER` interface.

**Technical Details (from Exploit-DB):**
- The vulnerability resides in the `SIOCGIFORDER` ioctl that is used to query the list of interface identifiers used to maintain the `ifnet_ordered_head` linked list of network interfaces.
- The code first computes the number of entries to copy based on the requested count and the actual count.
- Then the code loops through the interface list to copy the interface identifiers, but incorrectly checks the loop counter.
- By requesting one fewer entry than actually available, it causes one extra entry to be written past the allocated buffer.
- The provided PoC demonstrates this by creating a list of 5 entries and requesting only 4 entries which causes an out-of-bounds write, corrupting the memory after the allocated buffer.

**Affected Devices and Versions:**
- tvOS 10.2
- watchOS 3.2
- macOS Sierra 10.12.3
- iOS 10.3

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The vulnerability is addressed by improved bounds checking.
