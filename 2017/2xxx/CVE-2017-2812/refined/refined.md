The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2812.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `kdu_buffered_expand` function of the Kakadu SDK 7.9. The size of the contiguous codestream section in the JPEG 2000 file is not properly checked. When parsing the codestream, the software uses sizes from the file header without validation, leading to the allocation of an undersized buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow/Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-131).
- Out-of-bounds write: After multiple iterations, a size calculation becomes zero, leading to an undersized buffer allocation. Subsequent operations write past this allocated buffer, causing memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: The out-of-bounds write corrupts memory, potentially overwriting crucial program data or function pointers, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Crash: The vulnerability causes the program to crash, which could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted JPEG 2000 file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG 2000 file to the vulnerable application.
- User interaction is required to open/process the malicious JPEG 2000 file (UI:R)
