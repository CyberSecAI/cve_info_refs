- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the `psk` parameter within the `setSoftApConfig` command. This parameter is later used in a `system` call, allowing for command injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application fails to properly neutralize special characters within the `psk` parameter when constructing a shell command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. Specifically the `WPAPSK` parameter in the `sed` command is vulnerable.
  - Insufficient input validation on the `psk` parameter. Although there are checks for length and presence of `\n` or `\r` , these do not prevent all shell injection attacks.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the device with the privileges of the webserver user. This can lead to complete compromise of the device, allowing for data theft, modification of device settings, or use of the device in botnet activities, etc.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - HTTP requests to the web management interface.
  - The `setSoftApConfig` command is the specific vulnerable endpoint.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs a valid user account with administrator privileges to access the vulnerable command.
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
