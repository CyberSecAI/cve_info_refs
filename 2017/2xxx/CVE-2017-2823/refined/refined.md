- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free vulnerability in the .ISO parsing functionality of PowerISO.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability occurs when a pointer to a memory region that has already been freed is accessed. Specifically, a pointer loaded from a freed memory region is used in a call instruction, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to data corruption or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted .ISO file is required to trigger the vulnerability by opening it with PowerISO.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted .ISO file to the victim and convince them to open it using the vulnerable software.
