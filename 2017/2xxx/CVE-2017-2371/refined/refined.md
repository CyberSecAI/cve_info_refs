Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2371:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in how WebKit handles window.open calls when a named frame exists. Specifically, the `DOMWindow::open` function performs a check (`m_frame->tree().find(frameName)`) to determine if a frame with the given name exists. If it does, the code *assumes* that a subsequent check in `FrameLoader::findFrameForNavigation` will also succeed. However, this assumption is incorrect because `FrameLoader::findFrameForNavigation` includes an additional check within `Document::canNavigate` which can fail in two scenarios:

1.  **Sandboxed IFRAME:** If the frame attempting the navigation is sandboxed (e.g., using `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups"`), and it's trying to navigate to an ancestor frame, `Document::canNavigate` will return false.
2.  **Cross-Origin IFRAME:** If the frame attempting the navigation is cross-origin, `Document::canNavigate` will also return false.

This discrepancy allows an attacker to bypass the popup blocker. When `m_frame->tree().find(frameName)` succeeds and `FrameLoader::findFrameForNavigation` fails,  WebKit incorrectly creates a new window, triggering a popup without a user's click event.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Logic Error:** The primary weakness is a logic error in WebKit's window creation process. The code assumes that a successful `m_frame->tree().find(frameName)` implies that the subsequent `FrameLoader::findFrameForNavigation` will also succeed, which is not always the case.
*   **Popup Blocker Bypass:** The vulnerability bypasses WebKit's popup blocker, which is intended to prevent the automatic opening of new windows without user interaction.
*   **Cross-Origin/Sandboxed Bypass:**  The vulnerability can be triggered from sandboxed iframes or cross-origin iframes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unwanted Popups:** An attacker can cause unwanted popups to open, potentially disrupting the user's browsing experience.
*   **Malicious Content Delivery:**  Popups could be used to display malicious content or to perform other unwanted actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a malicious website that contains the exploit code.
*   **Compromised Website:** An attacker could inject the exploit code into a legitimate website.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If a website has an XSS vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious code to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server or Injection Point:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious HTML/JavaScript to the victim's browser either by hosting the page on a server, or through injection into a vulnerable web page.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker relies on the victim's browser executing the malicious JavaScript.
