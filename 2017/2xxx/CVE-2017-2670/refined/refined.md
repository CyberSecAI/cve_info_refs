{
  "CVE-2017-2670": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "It was found that with non-clean TCP close, Websocket server gets into infinite loop on every IO thread, effectively causing DoS.",
      "Severity": "Moderate",
      "Affected Products": [
        "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform",
        "undertow"
      ],
	  "Credit": "Gregory Ramsperger and Ryan Moak"
    },
    "Root cause": "The websocket server in Undertow does not handle non-clean TCP closes correctly.",
    "Vulnerability": "Websocket server enters an infinite loop on every IO thread when a non-clean TCP close occurs.",
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a non-clean TCP close to the websocket server.",
