- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer for the electronic tendering and bid opening system has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to trick a user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to prepare a malicious DLL file and trick a user into placing it in a specific location. The attacker does not need any specific network access, just local access through user interaction.
