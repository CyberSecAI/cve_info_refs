- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer for Denshinouhin Check System has an insecure DLL search path, which allows it to load malicious Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading due to a flawed DLL search path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must place a malicious DLL file in a specific location where the installer will search for it. The user must then execute the vulnerable installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick the user into placing the malicious DLL in a location accessible to the installer before executing the installer.
