Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The installer of Empirical Project Monitor - eXtended has a flaw in the DLL search path, which allows it to load dynamic link libraries in an insecure manner.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading: The installer doesn't properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files. This vulnerability is due to a DLL search path issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the installer. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: The attacker needs to have a local presence on the target system.
- User interaction required: The attack requires the victim to execute the vulnerable installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will find it before the legitimate one, or otherwise influence the DLL loading mechanism.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to execute the vulnerable installer application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-Other due to no exact mapping within CWE.
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.8 (High), and the CVSS v2 score is 6.8 (Medium).
- The vendor has discontinued the development and support for the application and recommends not using the installer.
- The vulnerability was reported by Eili Masami of Tachibana Lab.
