Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2017-2959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the ImageConversion component of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, specifically in how it parses JPEG images.
- The root cause is the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a heap-based buffer. This lack of validation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow:  The vulnerability exists because the application does not correctly check the size of the input data before copying it to a heap-allocated buffer.  If the input data is larger than the buffer, it will overflow, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution:  Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process. This means an attacker can gain control of the user's system and perform actions with the same privileges as the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires user interaction. An attacker must lure the victim to:
    - Visit a malicious web page or
    - Open a malicious file (likely a PDF containing a crafted JPEG)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or control the content of a JPEG image, specifically crafting the image data to trigger the heap overflow during processing by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to deliver this malicious content to the victim, either through a malicious website or a file such as a PDF.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in updates released by Adobe.
- The advisory indicates the vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2016-11-30, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2017-01-10.
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, but likely also impacts other Adobe products like Reader.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID '26489'.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
