Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is located in the `FrameLoader::clear` function within WebKit. The function is called during page navigations and is responsible for clearing the old document and attaching the new window object. A race condition exists where a new page navigation made during the clearing process (specifically, during `m_frame.document()->prepareForDestruction()`) can bypass the `m_needsClear` check. This leads to the new document's script being executed within the context of the old window object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Logic Error:** The primary weakness is a logic flaw in how `FrameLoader::clear` handles concurrent page navigation events, specifically the incorrect handling of the `m_needsClear` flag.
*   **Cross-Origin Information Leakage**: The vulnerability leads to the ability of a malicious web page to execute code in the context of a different domain

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the logic error, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code by injecting it into a page loaded in the context of the old window object.
*   **Cross-Origin data theft**: The Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that a malicious page can steal data from a different origin by accessing variables in the scope of the old window.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Content:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted web content. A malicious website or a compromised legitimate website can host the exploit.
*   **Page Navigation:** The attack exploits how WebKit handles page navigations and the associated cleanup processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker doesn't need any special access to the target machine. The vulnerability can be exploited through a regular web browser by simply visiting a malicious webpage.
*   **Malicious Webpage:** The attacker needs to create or compromise a webpage containing the exploit code that leverages the race condition in `FrameLoader::clear`.
*   **Target Browsing Malicious Content**: The user must load the malicious webpage using a vulnerable version of WebKit.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses nested iframes and a `showModalDialog()` call to create the race condition.
*   The exploit overwrites the `navigator` property of the iframe.
*   The exploit utilizes `defineGetter` to ensure the malicious page script is not executed until after the first navigation has occurred.
*   The PoC demonstrates stealing a `secret_key` variable from a different origin.

**Affected Software:**

*   WebKit
*   Safari
*   WebKitGTK+
*   tvOS
*   iOS

**Mitigation:**
* Apple patched this vulnerability in Safari 10.1.1, iOS 10.3.2, and tvOS 10.2.1
* Gentoo patched this vulnerability in WebKitGTK+ 2.16.3.
