  "CVE-2017-2416": {
    "description": "A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved input validation.",
    "affected_components": [
      "ImageIO framework"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check on the width and height of GIF images in the `GIFReadPlugin::init` function. By crafting a GIF image with negative height and weight values, an attacker can bypass checks based on file size, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access during image processing.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds access"
     ],
    "impact": "Processing a maliciously crafted GIF image can lead to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability also has the potential to cause application crashes due to memory corruption. Many clients will automatically reload and reparse the image on open, triggering the vulnerability again and again, lead to infinite loop.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a malformed GIF image which can be delivered through various channels such as instant messaging (IM), email, or any application that processes GIF images.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed GIF file with negative height and width values, and be able to deliver it to a victim system via IM, email, or other means where image parsing happens. An attacker can bypass size checks on web interfaces by using the PNG extension for the malformed GIF image."
