Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2464:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in `JSArray::appendMemcpy` within the `Array.concat` function.
- The `appendMemcpy` method calculates the combined size of arrays to be concatenated using the formula `unsigned newLength = startIndex + otherLength`. If `startIndex` is large enough, this addition can result in an integer overflow, causing a smaller buffer than needed to be allocated. When the data is copied, it overflows the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
- The vulnerability is triggered in `concatSlowPath` which calls native method `@appendMemcpy`. The `resultIndex` parameter is handled unsafely.
- Arrays of type `ArrayWithUndecided` can speed up the exploitation of this vulnerability, allowing it to be triggered with a shorter execution time. `ArrayWithUndecided` arrays are often of length 0 but can be created via the `splice` method on an array of undefined elements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write
- Memory corruption
- Unsafe handling of `resultIndex` parameter in `appendMemcpy`
- Use of `memcpy` without sufficient bounds checking

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution
- Denial of service (due to memory corruption)
- The exploit can be triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content in WebKit based browsers.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted web page using Safari or other WebKit-based browsers.
- The attacker needs to entice the victim to visit the malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website that exploits this vulnerability using JavaScript code.
- The attacker doesn't need prior authentication or special access on the victim's system.

**Additional details:**

- The exploit-db entry provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) JavaScript code demonstrating the vulnerability using the `Array.concat` and `splice` functions.
- The vulnerability is present in WebKit, impacting Safari, iOS, and tvOS.
- The vulnerability was identified by Jeonghoon Shin and natashenka of Google Project Zero.
- Apple's security advisories for Safari 10.1, iOS 10.3, and tvOS 10.2 mention CVE-2017-2464 as a memory corruption issue addressed through improved memory handling.

The information provided by exploit-db gives a more granular view of the root cause of the vulnerability than the Apple security advisories.
