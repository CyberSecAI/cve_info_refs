Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Reader DC handles fonts embedded within PDF files. A specially crafted font can cause the application to read beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The core issue is a read operation that accesses memory outside the intended buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure:  The primary impact is the ability to leak sensitive information. The vulnerability, on its own, does not lead to arbitrary code execution, but the advisory suggests that it could be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: An attacker can embed a crafted font within a PDF file, and the vulnerability can be triggered when the user opens this file in Adobe Reader DC.
- Malicious webpage: The vulnerability can also be triggered if the target visits a malicious web page that utilizes a crafted font, implying the vulnerability could possibly be triggered via a web browser if the browser renders pdfs and can load the malicious font

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file or webpage to the target user. 
- User interaction is required, as the target must open the malicious PDF or visit the malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader DC versions 15.020.20042 and earlier (Continuous track), 15.006.30244 and earlier (Classic track), and Acrobat/Reader XI versions 11.0.18 and earlier.
