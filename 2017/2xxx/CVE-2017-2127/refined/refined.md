- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "YOP Poll" contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on the web browser of a user accessing the poll generated by the application. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the way the plugin handles user input related to poll creation and display. An attacker can inject malicious script into the poll, which gets stored on the server and executed when users view the poll.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify polls, which typically requires a low level of privilege (e.g., a contributor or author role). The user interaction involves other users accessing the crafted poll.
