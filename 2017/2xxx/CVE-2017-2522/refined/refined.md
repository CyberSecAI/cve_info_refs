Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-2522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A memory corruption issue exists in the `CoreFoundation` component due to how it handles parsing maliciously crafted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by parsing maliciously crafted data. This could be achieved by an attacker through various means such as:
- Providing crafted data through an application.
- Delivering a malformed file that is processed by a vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide maliciously crafted data to the vulnerable `CoreFoundation` component. This could be achieved through a local application or through other means.

**Platforms Affected:**
- Apple tvOS 10.2.1
- Apple watchOS 3.2.2
- macOS Sierra 10.12.4, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, and OS X Yosemite 10.10.5
- iOS 10.3.2

**Additional Details:**
The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero. The vulnerability is related to the handling of `NSKeyedUnarchiver` and `NSCharacterSet`. A large bitmap passed during the unarchiving of an `NSCharacterSet` can cause an out-of-bounds write. Specifically, the `__CFCSetGetAnnexPlaneCharacterSet` function can write a pointer to semi-controlled data one qword below the heap allocation. This can lead to a crash but could be exploited for arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability can be exploited via IPC and as a persistence mechanism where apps serialize objects to disk.
