- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an issue in loading saved data within the "Security guide for website operators" application, leading to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands by loading specially crafted saved data. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (L) because it likely requires access to the file system where the saved data is stored. It requires a user to open or load the specially crafted data file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create specially crafted saved data and then convince a user of the vulnerable application to load this data. The user interaction (UI) is required.
