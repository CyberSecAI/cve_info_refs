The library features more than 6,000 buttons. It is the largest WordPress button library in the known universe.

[WordPress button sets](https://maxbuttons.com/product-category/button-packs/?utm_source=reposets&utm_medium=mbrepo&utm_content=button_pack&utm_campaign=reposets) make designers and developers much more productive.

#### Free Icons

You can use free icons when you create your buttons with MaxButtons Pro so we’ve built one of the largest libraries to inspire you and make your buttons really stand out.

#### Button Shortcode

1. Click the MaxButtons page from the admin menu.
2. Click the Add New button.
3. Create and customize your button using the button editor.
4. Fill out and select the options needed to build your button.
5. Once you’re ready, click Save.
6. A [button shortcode](http://maxbuttons.com/button-shortcode/?utm_source=reposhort&utm_medium=mbrepo&utm_content=reposhort&utm_campaign=reposhort) will be generated (ex: [maxbutton id=”17″] or [maxbutton name=”My Button Name”]).
7. Use the shortcode anywhere in your content and the button will appear.

You can also pass the button text and URL as parameters in the [button shortcode](http://maxbuttons.com/button-shortcode/?utm_source=reposhort2&utm_medium=mbrepo&utm_content=reposhort2&utm_campaign=reposhort2), giving you even greater flexibility. For example, if you want to create a set of buttons that look exactly the same, except for the text and URL, you could do something like this:

[maxbutton id=”17″ text=”Search Google” url=”http://google.com”]

[maxbutton name=”MaxButtons Button Name” text=”Search Yahoo” url=”http://yahoo.com”]

Another parameter you can give the shortcode is window, which tells the button whether or not to open the URL in a new window (by default the button opens the URL in the current window). To do so you always give the window parameter the value “new”, shown below. Anything else will open the button URL in the current window.

[maxbutton id=”17″ window=”new”]

You can also use the nofollow parameter, which will add a rel=”nofollow” attribute to the button when set to true, as shown below (the default is false):

[maxbutton id=”17″ nofollow=”true”]

NOTE: Passing parameters to the shortcode overrides those settings saved as part of the button.

#### Support

We work hard to give timely support during the week. And we give support when we’re on during the weekend.

**MaxButtons. Bringing the #buttonlove!**

## FAQ

### Do I have to copy a button if I want to have a different text or link?

No. The shortcode enables you to change various items on the button including the text and link. It’s better to create a single button and reuse it.

To change text and link :

[maxbutton id=”1″ text=”yourtext” url=”http://yoururl”]

If you only want to change one of the two, just leave the not needed option out.

Most often used options:

[maxbutton id=”1″ text=”yourtext” url=”http://yoururl” window=”new” nofollow=”true”]

You should *never* copy buttons if you only have a different line of text and / or link on any button. You can use the ‘add button’ dialog from your posts and pages to easily use this options

### How do I use the shortcode in a sidebar/widget?

Simply add the button shortcode to your widget (ex: [maxbutton id=”17″] or [maxbutton name=”MaxButtons Button Name”]). If the styling is missing on the widget, try to check the ‘use important’ checkbox under ‘advanced’ settings.

### How can I add the shortcode to my post/page template?

You can use the WordPress do\_shortcode function for this. Use the button name instead of ID for clearer code and easier replacement.

### Can’t see styling on the frontpage

Sometimes the button styling doesn’t load on the frontpage. There are usually two major reasons:

* Theme doesn’t have proper footer, check if wp\_footer() is called in the theme
* Using MaxButtons with sliders, dynamic page loaders (such a parallax and one-page themes ) or caching mechanisms.
* Some Caching plugins will remove styles. Either whitelist .maxbutton class or use the file loader in MaxButtons PRO settings
* If loading dynamically, you can output the style next to the button using [maxbuttons id=x ‘style=inline’] in the shortcode

### TablePress and MaxButtons

TablePress uses a caching mechanism which prevents the MaxButtons style design from functioning. To solve this problem, simply add the caching option to the shortcode like this: `[table id=123 cache_table_output=false]` . See this [support topic on TablePress](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/maxbuttons-css-stopped-working-in-tablepress?replies=6).

A solution which will keep the cache enabled is to use this in your shortcode: [maxbutton id=1 style=”inline”] . Flush the TablePress cache after adding this.

Use this only if you encounter issues. Most of the time MaxButtons works without any need for modifications.

### Part of my button is cutoff, how do I fix that?

Try enabling the container and setting its margin options. You could also fix this manually by surrounding your button shortcode with a div element with margins. For example:

```
<div style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;">
    <?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton id="17"]'); ?>
    <?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton name="MaxButtons Button Name"]'); ?>
</div>

```

Then adjust the margin values as needed (the order is: top, right, bottom, left).

### How do I center the button on a page?

Enable the “Wrap with Center Div” option in the Container settings.

### How do I align multiple buttons next to each other?

Enable the container option and set the alignment property to either “display: inline-block” or “float: left”. You might also want to add some margin values to put some spacing between your buttons. If that doesn’t work, try using a simple HTML table.

```
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>[maxbutton id="1"]</td>
        <td>[maxbutton id="2"]</td>
        <td>[maxbutton id="3"]</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```

* A lot of modern page builders have solution for positioning content, like grids. You can leverage those for better results.
* You can use [TablePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/) to create tables in WordPress.

### How do I display a MaxButton in a WordPress menu?

By default WordPress can’t display shortcodes in a menu. You can use this [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-in-menus/) to allow shortcodes in a menu. Just copy the MaxButton shortcode in the menu after installing

### How do I display a MaxButton in Excerpts / Post listing

By default WordPress only displays plain text in Post Excerpts. If you want to show a button there, you can add this snippet to your functions.php

```
add_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'shortcode_unautop');
add_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'do_shortcode');

```

Alternatively there are many plugins for customizing the excerpt that can do this for you and give control over other parts of the excerpt as well.

### How do I display a MaxButton in a slider?

This depends on the slider plugin you are using. Most of the well-known ones are allowing the use of shortcodes within the slides. To find out if your plugin can handle that, please ask the slider vendor.

### I use Autoptimize with MaxButtons

Autoptimize is supported and should work fine in most cases. However, if you see weird results, try to load the pageby adding ?ao\_noptimize=1 to the URL. If the buttons load normally then the issue is with Autoptimize. You can enter an exclusion for .maxbutton in the CSS exclusions.

### Non-Latin language users

The plugin works with users of non-lating languages with a few exceptions. First, the character set of the Database Table should be in UTF-8. If you see ‘????’ characters in the plugin, go to Settings -> Advanced. There is a button to set the tabel to UTF-8

Secondly, please use latin only characters for button name ( Basic settings) and extra classes ( Advanced settings ). Not doing so might prevent the styling output from working correctly.

### How do I upgrade the plugin?

Upgrading to the PRO version is quite simple. Obtain a license key via our [site](https://maxbuttons.com). You can enter the license code within the free version on the ‘Upgrade to PRO’ page. After entering the license key, the PRO version will automatically download and install. You are good to go!

This is the best implementation of adding buttons that I could imagine. Say I had to figure out was to center the buttons it would be wise to create a 3 column on the page and add them to the middle column. Thank you very much for this plugin!!

I’d say my html skill level is around a 4. I’m more of a front end guy. So adding buttons in the back end had me cringing. I was trying to add a button in an accordion content window so I couldn’t drag/drop a button in there. MaxButtons gave me the control to customize my button and drop in a shortcode to the page. Super stoked that I found this plugin!
