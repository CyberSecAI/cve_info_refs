Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of TIFF image files during parsing by the `ImageConversion` module within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, the issue stems from the lack of validation of the length of user-supplied data before it is copied to a heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The lack of proper length validation allows an attacker to supply data exceeding the buffer's capacity, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means the attacker could gain control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious file:** An attacker can craft a malicious TIFF file containing specially crafted data to trigger the overflow.
*   **Malicious web page:** An attacker could embed the malicious TIFF within a website and force a victim to load the page, therefore, triggering the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction in that the target must either open the malicious TIFF file or visit a malicious page which loads the malicious tiff file.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can execute the exploit remotely by having the victim interact with attacker controlled content.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users are protected via a specific Digital Vaccine filter.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
