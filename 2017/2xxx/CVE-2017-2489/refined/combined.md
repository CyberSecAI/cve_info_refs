uses to index an array of pointers with no bounds checking:

AppleIntelCapriController::getDisplayPipeCapability(AGDCFBGetDisplayCapability_t *, AGDCFBGetDisplayCapability_t *)

__text:000000000002A3D7                 mov     rdi, r14        ; to the buffer which will be sent back to userspace
__text:000000000002A3DA                 call    _memcpy

For this PoC we try to read the pointers at 0x2000 byte boundaries after this allocation; with luck there will be a vtable
pointer there which will allow us to read back vtable contents and defeat kASLR.

With a bit more effort this could be turned into an (almost) arbitrary read by for example spraying the kernel heap with the desired read target
then using a larger offset hoping to land in one of the sprayed buffers. A kernel arbitrary read would, for example, allow you to read the sandbox.kext
HMAC key and forge sandbox extensions if it still works like that.

MacOS kernel memory disclosure due to lack of bounds checking in AppleIntelCapriController::getDisplayPipeCapability

Selector 0x710 of IntelFBClientControl ends up in AppleIntelCapriController::getDisplayPipeCapability.

This method takes a structure input and output buffer. It reads an attacker controlled dword from the input buffer which it
uses to index an array of pointers with no bounds checking:

AppleIntelCapriController::getDisplayPipeCapability(AGDCFBGetDisplayCapability_t *, AGDCFBGetDisplayCapability_t *)
__text:000000000002A3AB                 mov     r14, rdx       ; output buffer, readable from userspace
__text:000000000002A3AE                 mov     rbx, rsi       ; input buffer, controlled from userspace
...
__text:000000000002A3B8                 mov     eax, [rbx]     ; read dword
__text:000000000002A3BA                 mov     rsi, [rdi+rax*8+0E40h]  ; use as index for small inline buffer in this object
__text:000000000002A3C2                 cmp     byte ptr [rsi+1DCh], 0  ; fail if byte at +0x1dc is 0
__text:000000000002A3C9                 jz      short ___fail
__text:000000000002A3CB                 add     rsi, 1E0Dh      ; otherwise, memcpy from that pointer +0x1e0dh
__text:000000000002A3D2                 mov     edx, 1D8h       ; 0x1d8 bytes

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
