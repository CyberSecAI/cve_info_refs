Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an information leak vulnerability in the Huawei HiLink app for iOS. The vulnerability allows a malicious application, installed by tricking the user, to access data within the HiLink app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** The core vulnerability is that the HiLink app allows unauthorized access to its data by other applications running on the same device.
- **Insufficient Access Controls:** The app does not properly restrict which applications can access its stored data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive data stored within the HiLink app. This data is not explicitly described but could include user credentials, device configurations, or other user-related information managed by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** An attacker needs to create a malicious iOS application.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick the user into installing the malicious application on their iPhone.
- **Local Access:** The malicious application exploits the weakness within the context of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Development of Malicious iOS Application:** The attacker needs to be able to develop and potentially distribute (via unofficial app stores) a malicious iOS application.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must convince the user to install the malicious application.
- **Local Execution:** The malicious code executes within the user's iOS environment.
