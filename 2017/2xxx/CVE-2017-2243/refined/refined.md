Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2243:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Responsive Lightbox" WordPress plugin, prior to version 1.7.2, contains a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing sensitive information (cookies, credentials, etc.)
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that injects malicious JavaScript code as parameters.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a specially crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and distribute it to potential victims.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the target server.
*   The attacker relies on user interaction (clicking the crafted URL) to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The JVN report provides a CVSS v3 score of 6.1 (Medium Severity) and a CVSS v2 score of 2.6
*   The vulnerability was reported by Chris Liu to IPA.

**Resolution:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.2 of the plugin. Users should update to this version or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
