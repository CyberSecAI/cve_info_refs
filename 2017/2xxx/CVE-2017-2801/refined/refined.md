Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2801:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a programming error in the `Botan::x500_name_cmp` function within the Botan cryptographic library. Specifically, the function's logic for comparing X.509 Distinguished Names (DNs), especially when handling whitespace and null bytes, leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125) triggered during the comparison of X.500 strings. This occurs when the comparison logic advances a pointer beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Improper Handling of Whitespace and Null Bytes:** The `x500_name_cmp` function incorrectly handles whitespace and null bytes within the distinguished name strings. Specifically, when one string has a null byte after whitespace, and the other has more whitespace, the comparison logic can increment a pointer beyond the bounds of the string, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application using the Botan library to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can also lead to information disclosure due to the out-of-bounds read, potentially exposing sensitive memory contents.
- **Certificate Verification Bypass**: A carefully crafted certificate could pass or fail the equality check. A discrepancy between the way these malformed strings are handled in Botan and other X.509 libraries could lead to other types of abuse.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed X.509 Certificates:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted X.509 certificate that contains maliciously crafted DN strings in the subject and issuer fields.
- The attack requires a specially crafted X509 certificate be presented to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to present a crafted X.509 Certificate**: An attacker needs the ability to present a specially crafted X.509 certificate to a client or server application that utilizes the vulnerable Botan library. This could involve intercepting the certificate during a TLS handshake or having the application parse a malicious certificate file.
- **No special privileges:** No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code resides in the `Botan::x500_name_cmp` function.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to the way the comparison function handles whitespace and null bytes when comparing X.500 names.
- Example of vulnerable strings `String 1: AA\x20\x00AAAAAAAAAA` and `String 2:  AA\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20`

**Mitigation:**

-   The vulnerability can be fixed by adding an additional check in `x500_name_cmp` to ensure that if one string has reached the end while the other hasn't, the comparison should return false, thereby preventing out-of-bounds reads.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is present in Botan library versions prior to the fix.
-   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3939-1) indicates the fix for oldstable (jessie) is in version 1.10.8-2+deb8u2. The stable (stretch) version was fixed prior to its initial release.
-   The Talos report provides a crash information output from AddressSanitizer.
