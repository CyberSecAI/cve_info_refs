- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Baidu IME installer has an issue with its DLL search path, which may cause it to load dynamic link libraries insecurely.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who runs the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious DLL file is placed in a specific folder that the installer searches. The user must be tricked into placing the malicious DLL in this location before running the installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL file on the user's system in a location that the installer will search. User interaction is required to launch the installer.
