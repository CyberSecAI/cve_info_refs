The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2498.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A certificate validation issue existed in the handling of untrusted certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of untrusted certificates within the Security component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to circumvent the certificate trust policy. This could lead to an attacker potentially being able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept communications, or other attacks that rely on trusted certificates.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the handling of untrusted certificates within the Security component. An attacker might present a crafted or untrusted certificate that is not properly validated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be in a position to present a crafted or untrusted certificate to the vulnerable system. This might be achieved through network attacks or by getting the user to interact with the malicious certificate in other ways.
