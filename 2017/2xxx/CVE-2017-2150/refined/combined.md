* **Booking Quantity Control:** Enabled the ability to enable and define a field for 'Booking Quantity Control,' allowing visitors to define the number of items they can book for specific dates or times within a single reservation. Find this option in New Capacity section on Booking > Settings General page. (Business Large, MultiUser)
* **Capacity Shortcode:** Added the Capacity shortcode for showing available (remained) slots per selected dates and times: [capacity\_hint]. You can use it in the booking form at the Booking > Settings > Form page. (Business Large, MultiUser)
* **Max. visitors field at the Booking > Resources page is deprecated and removed.** For defining capacity, use child booking resources. For defining max visitors selection, use a new custom booking form with a different number of users/visitors selection. (Business Medium/Large, MultiUser)
* **Unavailable Time Definition Engine:** Introduced an engine for defining an unavailable specific number of dates or specific times before or after the booking. It now works in all situations, even for fully booked dates. For bookings where you have selected several dates and booked specific times, the system will extend the unavailable time interval for all such time slots on each day. (Business Medium/Large, MultiUser)
* **Booking Details Tooltip:** Added the ability to show booking details in a mouse-over tooltip for specific booked dates or times during a day, significantly improving the speed of this functionality. This can now show booking details even for fully booked dates. (Business Medium/Large, MultiUser)
* **Simplified Booking Form Layout:** Easily configure your booking form in rows and columns using new Simple HTML shortcodes. Create rows with ..., columns with ..., labels with ... and spacer with  or width:40px; or height:2em;. For example, to create a single row with two columns, use:  ... ... .
* **Simplified field data tag**:
  ```
  <f>...</f>
  ```

  . Easily highlight field data by enclosing it within

  ```
  <f>...</f>
  ```

  tags in the 'Content of booking fields data' section on the Booking > Settings > Form page. For example:

  ```
  <f>[secondname]</f>
  ```

  . This will highlight the background of the field on the Booking Listing page.
* **Redesigned Payment Buttons**: Payment buttons in the new Booking Confirmation window have been redesigned for a more user-friendly experience.
* **Different Rates for options in select-boxes**: Now, different rates are supported, depending on the selection of options in select-boxes. Example of rate configuration at Booking > Resources > Cost and rates > Rate page:
  ```
  [visitors=1:270;2:300;3:380;4:450]
  ```

  (9.8.0.5) *(Business Medium/Large, MultiUser)*
* **Payment System Responses**: Now, responses from payment systems after visitors' payments are recorded in the Note section of the booking, provided "Logging actions for booking" is activated at the Booking > Settings General page in the "Booking Admin Panel" section. *(Business Small/Medium/Large, MultiUser)*
* **Enhanced Booking Log**: The booking log now keeps track of booking details, such as cost calculations, actions related to payment request pages via email links, and other important events.
* **Additional Notes**: Added the ability to add extended notes about "Total Cost | Discounts applied | Subtotal cost | Deposit Due | Balance Remaining" after creating the booking. Also, added notes about the approval of the booking by the payment system after a response from the Payment gateway. Notes are now added for bookings that were imported from Google Calendar.
* **Date Selection Condition**: Added a condition for defining a specific number of selected dates if started from a specific date. Condition format: '
  ```
  {select-day condition="date" for="2023-10-01" value="20,25,30-35"}
  ```

  '. Example of shortcode:

  ```
  [booking type=3 options='{select-day condition="date" for="2023-10-01" value="20,25,30-35"}']
  ```

  *(Business Medium/Large, MultiUser)*
* **Cancellation Date Hint Shortcode**: Introduced the
  ```
  [cancel_date_hint]
  ```

  shortcode, which shows the date that is 14 days before the selected check-in date. (9.7.3.16) *(Business Medium/Large, MultiUser)*

### Improvements:

* Showing the full URL .ics feed at the Booking > Settings > Sync > "Export - .ics" page for easier copying of URLs (9.8.0.6).
* When creating new fast blank bookings, all fields are autofilled with '---' instead of 'admin' values, and the email address is filled with 'blank@wpbookingmanager.com,' which is skipped during sending emails by Booking Calendar. *(Business Small/Medium/Large, MultiUser)*
* **Improved 'Aggregate' Parameter**: Now, when using 'aggregate,' if you mark specific dates as unavailable in aggregation resources on the Booking > Availability page, the system will automatically make those dates unavailable in the source resource.
* **Enhanced Availability Management**: If you mark dates as unavailable in the aggregate booking resources on the Booking > Availability page, the system treats these dates as unavailable for all booking resources, including parent and child resources. This ensures consistent availability management.
* For booking resources with specific capacities, when you use 'aggregate' for a 'parent booking resource' with a set capacity, the system adds bookings from 'aggregate booking resources' to the 'parent resource' and its child resources. Any 'unavailable dates' marked on the Booking > Availability page will affect both the parent and its child resources, making those times or dates unavailable for booking.

### Under Hood Changes:

* Under Hood: Updated Stripe PHP library from version 9.0.0 to 12.6.0.

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue of redirection to the "Unknown-Stripe-Payment" page after Stripe payment in Booking Calendar MultiUser version, if the option "Receive all payments only to Super Booking Admin account" was activated. (9.7.3.5) *(MultiUser)*
* Corrected the issue of not showing conditional time slots, which depend on Seasons. Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: # jQuery 10(9.7.3.6)
* Resolved the problem of removing duplicate days' selections at the "Specific days" selection option under range days selection mode using 2 mouse clicks.
* Fixed the issue of showing available dates in the search form, while such dates were defined as unavailable at Booking > Availability page (9.7.3.11).
* Eliminated the issue when used conditional days selection logic, and some weekdays were not defined in seasons. In this case, the system will use the default days selection settings *(Business Medium/Large, MultiUser)*.
