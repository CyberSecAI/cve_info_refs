### Managing repositories with their id via hammer does not respect the role filters

**Description**

Cloned from <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1429590>

Description of problem:
After settings a new role to allow restricted access on a repository with a filter (filter set on the Product Name), the filter is not respected when the actions are done via hammer using the repository id.

How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have repositories from more than 1 Product, by example:
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
 Red Hat Satellite
 Custom\_Product

```
Optional -> You can also have 2 Organization and only allow 1 of them through the filter:
     MyOrg
     OtherOrg
```

2. Create a new role "Custom\_bug\_role"

3. Create the following 2 filters for that role
 Filter 1
 Resource type: Organization
 Permission: view\_organizations
 Search filter: name = "MyOrg"

```
Filter 2
     Resource type: Product and Repositories
     Permission: view_products, edit_products, sync_products
     Search filter: name = "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server"
```

4. Create a test user and assign the custom role
 Username: Test\_bug\_user
 Role: Custom\_bug\_role

5. With hammer, list the repository using the test user credentials
 A. Listing the repositories works as expected, only "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" repositories will be displayed:
# hammer -u Test\_bug\_user -p testbug repository list --organization MyOrg
 [...]
 33 | Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server Kickstart x86\_64 7.1 | Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server | yum
 27 | Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server - Extras RPMs x86\_64 | Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server | yum
 [...]

```
B. Showing repository information using it's ID allows the user to see any repository (from any Product or any Organisation), this is not expected:
   # hammer -u Test_bug_user -p testbug repository info --id 62
          ID:                 62
          Name:               Custom_Repo
          Label:              Custom_Repo
          Organization:       OtherOrg
          Red Hat Repository: no
          Content Type:       yum
          [...]
```
```
C. Uploading a package to a any repository is also possible using its ID (from any Product or any Organisation), this is not expected:
   # hammer -u Test_bug_user -p testbug repository upload-content --id 62 --path test.rpm
        Successfully uploaded file 'test.rpm'.
```

It seems like when we specify --product --name --organization, the permission are applied correctly. However, it looks like using their id bypass this.

Actual results:
When using repository id, we can show info from any repository and upload new package to them.

Expected results:
Have the role filters applied on the resource whether we are using the name or the id
