Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-2161

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The FlashAir PhotoShare function fails to properly restrict access permissions. When the PhotoShare feature is enabled, the device switches from its default wireless LAN connection to a PhotoShare-specific one. Due to improper access control, files not intended to be shared can be accessed by other users connected to the PhotoShare network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284 / CWE-425):** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper access control mechanisms when using the PhotoShare feature. This allows unauthorized access to data that should be restricted. Specifically, the vulnerability is described as a failure to restrict access permissions, which allows users to potentially view images they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who is connected to the PhotoShare wireless network can access image data that were set not to be shared. This could lead to the exposure of private or sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the PhotoShare wireless network.
- **Wireless Access:** The attacker needs to be connected to the PhotoShare network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user connected to the FlashAir PhotoShare network. They need to have low privileges within the context of that network to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any special level of access or permissions, other than being connected to the PhotoShare network.

**Affected Products:**
- TOSHIBA FlashAir SDHC Memory Card (SD-WD/WC Series <W-02>) V2.00.04 and earlier
- TOSHIBA FlashAir SDHC Memory Card (SD-WE Series <W-03>) V3.00.02 and earlier

**Solution:**
- Update the FlashAir software to the latest version and configure the wireless LAN settings appropriately. This involves updating the firmware using the FlashAir Software Update tool and setting a secure SSID and password.
