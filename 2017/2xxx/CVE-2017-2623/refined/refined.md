{
  "CVE-2017-2623": {
    "Description": "The rpm-ostree tool binds together the RPM packaging model with the OSTree model of bootable file system trees. It provides commands which can be used both on client systems as well as server-side composes. The rpm-ostree-client package provides commands usable on client systems to upgrade and rollback.\n\nIt was discovered that rpm-ostree and rpm-ostree-client fail to properly check GPG signatures on packages when doing layering. Packages with unsigned or badly signed content could fail to be rejected as expected. This issue is partially mitigated on RHEL Atomic Host, where certificate pinning is used by default.",
    "Root cause": "rpm-ostree and rpm-ostree-client fail to properly check GPG signatures on packages when doing layering.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate GPG signature verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "Packages with unsigned or badly signed content could be installed, potentially leading to malicious code execution or system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could provide crafted or modified RPM packages during the layering process.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious RPM package during the package layering operation."
