- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A signedness vulnerability during the calculation of the number of tab definitions to grow an array. The application uses a signed integer to represent the count of tab definitions. If a negative value is provided, it's treated as a large positive number in the allocation process, but due to comparison being signed, it skips resizing the buffer. When the application later attempts to read tab data from the file, it overwrites the undersized buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer underflow: The application uses a signed integer for tab count, leading to an underflow if the count is negative.
    - Heap-based buffer overflow: Due to the incorrect buffer size calculation, a `memcpy` operation writes outside the bounds of the allocated heap memory.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution under the context of the application. The buffer overflow can overwrite critical data structures in the heap and divert control flow.

- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HWP document file, where the tab count in the `HWPTAG_TAB_DEF` record is set to a negative value.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious HWP document and entice a user to open it.
