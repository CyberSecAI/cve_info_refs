The content is related to CVE-2017-2863.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the PDF parsing functionality of Infix 7.1.5. The `SetSize?` function sets a dword value that is later used as a size argument to `memset`. When parsing a malformed PDF file, this value can be set to `0xFFFFFFFF` which should indicate an error, but due to a lack of error checking, the program uses this value in the `memset` function, causing a memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write, lack of error handling/validation of the value used in `memset`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted PDF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send the crafted PDF file to a victim who opens the file using Infix 7.1.5. The attacker does not need any special privileges or network access. The attacker just needs to entice the victim to open the malicious PDF.
