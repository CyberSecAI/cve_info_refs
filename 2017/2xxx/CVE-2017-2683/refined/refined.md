- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RUGGEDCOM NMS web application suffers from a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a non-privileged user to gain administrative permissions.
- **Attack vectors**: A non-privileged user interacts with the web application on Ports 8080/TCP and 8081/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user of the web application and able to inject malicious script which will be executed by other users of the application. The attacker requires network access to the web application.
