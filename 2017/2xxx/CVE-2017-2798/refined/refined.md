- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `GetIndexArray` function of the AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter. Specifically, an out-of-bounds write occurs due to an integer overflow when calculating the index to write to the buffer. The size of the allocated buffer is determined by `blankRec->col` and `blankRec->rw`, while the index is calculated using `a1->col_1`, `a1->labelSstes[index].cell.rw`, and `a1->labelSstes[index].cell.col`. If these values are manipulated through a specially crafted XLS file, the calculated index can exceed the allocated buffer size.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking in the `GetIndexArray` function when writing to the buffer. The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted XLS file.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution due to the heap corruption caused by the out-of-bounds write. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected system.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending or providing a malicious XLS file to the vulnerable application. The application uses the AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter to convert the XLS file to HTML, which triggers the vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide or send a specially crafted XLS file to a system that processes it using the vulnerable software.
