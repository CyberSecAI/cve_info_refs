- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer for the CASL II simulator (self-extract format) has a weakness in how it searches for and loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). This insecure DLL loading can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading, specifically a vulnerability related to the DLL search path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer might load it from. The user is tricked into placing the malicious DLL in the correct location.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in a specific location accessible to the installer. The user must then execute the installer, which would load the malicious DLL.
