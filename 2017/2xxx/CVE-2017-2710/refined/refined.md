- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) function of some Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the FRP function by performing specific operations during the re-configuration of the mobile phone, specifically when updating the Google account.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) mechanism on the affected Huawei devices. This enables the attacker to gain unauthorized access and control over the device, modifying the configuration of the smartphone.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs physical access to the Huawei smartphone in order to exploit the vulnerability.
