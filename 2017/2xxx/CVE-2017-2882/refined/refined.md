- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `check_circleservers.sh` script downloads an encrypted tar archive from an unauthenticated HTTP server, decrypts it using a known key, and extracts it to `/tmp`. Due to the lack of authentication, an attacker can impersonate the server and provide a malicious archive, overwriting arbitrary files in `/tmp`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unauthenticated HTTP download: The script fetches the update archive from an unauthenticated HTTP server, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - Insecure file extraction: The downloaded archive is extracted to `/tmp` without proper validation, leading to the possibility of file overwriting.
    - Known encryption key: The decryption key for the downloaded archive is known, making it trivial to create malicious payloads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By overwriting critical executables in the `/tmp` directory (e.g., `/tmp/aescrypt`), the attacker can execute arbitrary code when the script is run next, leading to complete compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Man-in-the-middle attack: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify the HTTP traffic between the device and the update server.
    - Server impersonation: The attacker needs to control the host serving the update archive to deliver the malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be on the network path between the Circle with Disney device and the legitimate update server (`download.meetcircle.co`).
    - The attacker must be capable of impersonating the update server.
