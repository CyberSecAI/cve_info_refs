Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Denshi Nyusatsu Check Tool has an issue with its DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries. This means the application might load a malicious DLL from an unintended location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The application does not properly control the locations from which it loads DLLs. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will find and load it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited locally, meaning the attacker needs to have some presence on the target system.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must be tricked into placing a malicious DLL in a specific folder where the application will load it from.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to write files to the victim's machine.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to place a malicious DLL file in a specific location.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of where the application searches for DLLs.
