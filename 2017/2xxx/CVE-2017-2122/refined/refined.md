**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within Tenable Nessus. An authenticated user can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML content that is then stored by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and store malicious scripts within the Nessus application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of other Nessus users who view the injected malicious content.
- This can potentially lead to:
  - Session hijacking: stealing user cookies to impersonate legitimate users
  - Data theft: accessing or modifying sensitive data displayed within the Nessus interface
  - Phishing: redirecting users to malicious sites or displaying fake login forms
  - Defacement: altering the content of Nessus pages

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit it.
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Nessus to be able to store the malicious script.
- User Interaction: The malicious script executes when a victim user interacts with the stored crafted content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the vulnerable Nessus application.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject and store malicious content through an unspecified vector.

**Affected Versions:**
- Nessus versions 6.8.0, 6.8.1, 6.9.0, 6.9.1, and 6.9.2 are vulnerable

**Resolution:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Nessus version 6.9.3

**Additional Notes:**
