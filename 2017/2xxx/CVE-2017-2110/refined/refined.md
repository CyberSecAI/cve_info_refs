Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Access CX App fails to properly verify SSL server certificates. This means it does not check if the certificate presented by the server is valid and trusted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation. The application doesn't verify the validity of the SSL certificates of the servers it communicates with.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can intercept and eavesdrop on encrypted communications between the app and the server. This could expose sensitive information being transmitted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based. An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the app and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. This could be achieved by:
  - Setting up a malicious WiFi access point.
  - Compromising a router or other network equipment.
  - Injecting malicious code into the network path.
- No specific privileges on the user's device are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided analysis includes a CVSS v3 score of 4.8 and a CVSS v2 score of 4.0, indicating a moderate severity level.
- The vulnerability affects both Android and iOS versions of the Access CX App prior to specific versions.
- The JPCERT/CC analysis explicitly assumes the attacker is conducting a man-in-the-middle attack using a malicious wireless LAN access point.
- The vulnerability was reported by Gaku Taniguchi of RiskFinder, Inc. to IPA.
