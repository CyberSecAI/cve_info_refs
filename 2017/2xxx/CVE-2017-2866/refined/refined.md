- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `appid` parameter from the GET request is directly passed to the `system` call without sanitization in the `/api/CONFIG/backup` API handler of the `apid` daemon.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected device, leading to potential compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/api/CONFIG/backup` endpoint with a malicious `appid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. Although the API is intended for authenticated users, the weak authentication vulnerability (CVE-2017-2864) allows unauthenticated access, so any attacker with network access to the device can exploit the command injection vulnerability.
