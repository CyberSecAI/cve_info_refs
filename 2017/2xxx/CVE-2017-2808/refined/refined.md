  "CVE-2017-2808": {
    "Description": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the account parsing component of the Ledger-CLI 3.1.1. A specially crafted ledger file can cause a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can convince a user to load a journal file to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application misuses the std::unique_ptr type when exchanging objects between different parts of the parser, causing a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Loading a specially crafted ledger file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious journal file and convince a user to open it using Ledger-CLI.",
        "Affected component": "Account parsing component of Ledger-CLI 3.1.1"
