| [Description](#c0)  Brian Raymond    2002-02-09 23:58:17 UTC  ``` The bootstrap and system install is dependent on ibiblio at this point for downloading of packages. Changing in make.globals doesn't help because it is overwritten at the start of the bootstrap by the base packages (not sure exactly where). Exporting the GENTOO_MIRRORS got me through the bootstrap by using hte French mirror however when emerging the system some packages failed because they still tried to pull from ibiblio. Ended up using URL rewriting in Apache to get to the french mirror (different path name some simple host redirect doesn't work).  It would be desirable to include multiple mirrors that would be run through for all packages taking into account the different paths on different mirrors. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-10 00:49:06 UTC  ``` I think the way to do this is to upgrade ebuild.sh:  1. define GMIRROR=<http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/distfiles> 2. In the ebuild.sh download loop, redefine GMIRROR to point to the "current" mirror 3.  Then ebuilds can have SRC_URI="${GMIRROR}/foo.tar.gz"  (We can't use GENTOO_MIRRORS since it's designed to hold multiple mirrors; thus GMIRROR) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-23 13:28:32 UTC  ``` This is fixed in portage-1.8.9_pre14 (in testing).  You can now specify SRC_URI="<http://mirror/foo.tar.gz>" for files that we mirror directly.  "<http://mirror>" gets expanded to the first mirror defined in GENTOO_MIRRORS, or our main ibiblio source mirror if no GENTOO_MIRRORS are defined. ``` |  |

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  openSUSE (At this moment openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.0 and Tumbleweed) please feel free to reopen this bug against that version (!you must update the "Version" component in the bug fields, do not just reopen please), or alternatively create a new ticket.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed during the lifetime of the release.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0304

## Ledger CLI Account Directive Use-After-Free Vulnerability

##### August 30, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2808

### Summary

An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the account parsing component of the Ledger-CLI 3.1.1. A specially crafted ledger file can cause a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can convince a user to load a journal file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Ledger HEAD
Ledger 3.1.1

### Product URLs

<http://ledger-cli.org>

<https://github.com/ledger/ledger.git>

<https://github.com/ledger/ledger/tree/v3.1.1>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-416: Use After Free

### Details

Ledger-cli is a plain-text, double-entry accounting system that is useable from the command line. It is based around a plain-text format known as a journal file that contains each transaction for each account.

When parsing a malformed journal file, the application will misuse the std::unique\_ptr type when exchanging objects between different parts of the parser. Due to this, when these pointers go out of scope they will be released and destroyed. However, due to the pointers still being retained by the application a use-after-free vulnerability will occur when the application attempts to process a user’s commands.

When first parsing a journal file, the application will execute the following code. This code will instantiate an instance\_t, and then call its `.parse()` method [1]. The `.parse()` method will simply enter a loop that processes each line of the journal file using the `read_next_directive` method [2].

```
src/textual.cc:1987
std::size_t journal_t::read_textual(parse_context_stack_t& context_stack)
{
  TRACE_START(parsing_total, 1, "Total time spent parsing text:");
  {
    instance_t instance(context_stack, context_stack.get_current(), NULL,
                        checking_style == journal_t::CHECK_PERMISSIVE);
    instance.apply_stack.push_front
      (application_t("account", context_stack.get_current().master));
    instance.parse();                                                   // \ [1]
  }
  TRACE_STOP(parsing_total, 1);

  // Apply any deferred postings at this time
  master->apply_deferred_posts();
...
}
\
src/textual.cc:236
void instance_t::parse(()
{
...
  while (in.good() && ! in.eof()) {
    try {
      read_next_directive(error_flag);                                  // [2]
    }
    catch (const std::exception& err) {

```

The `read_next_directive` method will iterate through each line of the journal file whilst looking at the first character to determine which command to process. If the first character is numeric, then the application will assume that it’s an account directive and will call the `xact_directive` method to handle it [1].

```
src/textual.cc:334
void instance_t::read_next_directive(bool& error_flag)

  char * line;
  std::streamsize len = read_line(line);
  if (len == 0 || line == NULL)
    return;

  if (! std::isspace(line[0]))
    error_flag = false;

  switch (line[0]) {
...
  case '0':
  case '1':
  case '2':
  case '3':
  case '4':
  case '5':
  case '6':
  case '7':
  case '8':
  case '9':
    xact_directive(line, len);          // [1]
    break;
...

```

Inside the `xact_directive` method, the application will call the `parse_xact` [1] method which will return a pointer. This pointer will then be assigned to a `unique_ptr<xact_t>` [2]. Due to it being incorrectly initialized from a pointer, there are no references to it. When the variable goes out of scope at [3], it will then be freed.

```
src/textual.cc:694
void instance_t::xact_directive(char * line, std::streamsize len)

  TRACE_START(xacts, 1, "Time spent handling transactions:");

  if (xact_t * xact = parse_xact(line, len, top_account())) {               // [1]
    unique_ptr<xact_t> manager(xact);                                       // [2]

    if (context.journal->add_xact(xact)) {
      manager.release();        // it's owned by the journal now
      context.count++;
    }
    // It's perfectly valid for the journal to reject the xact, which it
    // will do if the xact has no substantive effect (for example, a
    // checking xact, all of whose postings have null amounts).
  } else {                                                                  // [3]
    throw parse_error(_("Failed to parse transaction"));

  TRACE_STOP(xacts, 1);

```

The `parse_xact` method, is responsible for allocating the `xact_t` object [1]. Near the end of this function, the application will call the `parse_post` method [2]. This method will allocate a `post_t` object, and then link the `xact_t` object to the `post_t`. Afterwards, the returned `post_t` will then be linked back to the `xact_t` object [3].

```
src/textual.cc:1776
xact_t * instance_t::parse_xact(char *          line,
                                std::streamsize len,
                                account_t *     account)

  TRACE_START(xact_text, 1, "Time spent parsing transaction text:");

  unique_ptr<xact_t> xact(new xact_t);                              // [1]

  xact->pos           = position_t();
  xact->pos->pathname = context.pathname;
  xact->pos->beg_pos  = context.line_beg_pos;
  xact->pos->beg_line = context.linenum;
  xact->pos->sequence = context.sequence++;

  bool reveal_context = true;
...
      if (post_t * post =
          parse_post(p, len - (p - line), account, xact.get())) {   // [2]
        reveal_context = true;
        xact->add_post(post);                                       // [3]
        last_post = post;
      }
      reveal_context = true;
    }
  }
...
  return xact.release();

```

Inside the `parse_post` method, the application will allocate a `post_t` via it’s constructor [1], and then begin to parse any extra flags that were specified in the post. In order to reach the most vulnerable path which leads directly to code eecution, the `POST_DEFERRED` flag must be specified. This requires that there be an entry that begins and ends with the `<` and `>` characters [2].

```
src/textual.cc:1404
post_t * instance_t::parse_post(char *          line,
                                std::streamsize len,
                                account_t *     account,
                                xact_t *        xact,
                                bool            defer_expr)

  TRACE_START(post_details, 1, "Time spent parsing postings:");

  unique_ptr<post_t> post(new post_t);                          // [1]

  post->xact          = xact;   // this could be NULL
  post->pos           = position_t();
  post->pos->pathname = context.pathname;
  post->pos->beg_pos  = context.line_beg_pos;
  post->pos->beg_line = context.linenum;
  post->pos->sequence = context.sequence++;
...
  else if (*p == '<' && *(e - 1) == '>') {
    post->add_flags(POST_DEFERRED);                             // [2]
    DEBUG("textual.parse", "line " << context.linenum << ": "
          << "Parsed a deferred account name");
    p++; e--;
  }
...
  return post.release();
...

```

Once the file is done parsing, the application will return back to the `journal_t::read_textual` method. At [1], the application will then proceed to apply any transactional information for the deferred posts in the `master` account that have been parsed by the `instance_t` parser.

```
src/textual.cc:1987
std::size_t journal_t::read_textual(parse_context_stack_t& context_stack)

  TRACE_START(parsing_total, 1, "Total time spent parsing text:");
  {
    instance_t instance(context_stack, context_stack.get_current(), NULL,
                        checking_style == journal_t::CHECK_PERMISSIVE);
    instance.apply_stack.push_front
      (application_t("account", context_stack.get_current().master));
    instance.parse();
  }
  TRACE_STOP(parsing_total, 1);

  // Apply any deferred postings at this time
  master->apply_deferred_posts();                               // [1]

```

This is done by the following code. At this point, the post object has already been freed due to it being out of scope due to lack of references. At [1], since the pointer was still assigned to the object, the application will iterate through all the deferred posts within the account. However, due to the object being released, the virtual method dereference at [2] will dereference memory that has gone out of scope.

```
src/account.cc:157
void account_t::apply_deferred_posts()

  if (deferred_posts) {
    foreach (deferred_posts_map_t::value_type& pair, *deferred_posts) {     // [1]
      foreach (post_t * post, pair.second)
        post->account->add_post(post);                                      // [2]
    }
    deferred_posts = none;
  }

  // Also apply in child accounts
  foreach (const accounts_map::value_type& pair, accounts)
    pair.second->apply_deferred_posts();

```

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

Simply run the ledger binary with the provided proof-of-concept as an argument followed by the command type. Both `xml` and `register` will trigger the vulnerability.

```
$ ledger -f poc.sample [xml|register]

```

The proof-of-concept simply needs to have an account entry within it that includes a deferred posting. This means that a line must exist that begins with a number to specify an account directive. Then before the next account directive, there must be something within ‘<’ and ‘>’ symbols. This will enter the path that will dereference a function pointer.
