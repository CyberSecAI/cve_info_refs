- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NFC Port Software remover application has an issue with its DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a location where the vulnerable application will search for and load it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder. The user must then run the application.
