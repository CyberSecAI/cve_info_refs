Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2638:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the REST API in Infinispan did not properly enforce authentication constraints. This occurred after a migration from a servlet-based implementation to a RESTEasy Netty-based one, which led to the loss of authentication functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication enforcement in the REST API. This allows unauthorized access to the Infinispan data grid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Access:** An attacker could read data stored in the default cache or a known cache name without proper authorization.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify data stored in the default cache or a known cache name without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API:** The vulnerability is exposed through the REST API of Infinispan. An attacker can send HTTP requests to the REST API endpoints to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Infinispan instance in order to exploit the vulnerability via the REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target Infinispan instance.
- **Knowledge of REST API:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of the Infinispan REST API to construct the appropriate HTTP requests for exploitation.
- **Knowledge of Cache Names:** While the vulnerability exists for default cache, it can also be exploited with the knowledge of other cache names that exist within Infinispan data grid.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Infinispan version 9.0.0.Final.
- The fix involved restoring REST authentication, specifically supporting BASIC authentication and integration with server's SecurityRealms.
- Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1 was also affected, and a security advisory (RHSA-2017:1097) was released to address the issue.
