- **Root cause of vulnerability:** DLL hijacking vulnerability in the Dell Precision Optimizer's `poaService.exe` service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `ati.dll` library attempts to load `atiadlxx.dll`. Because this DLL is not present in the application's directory, the system searches for it in directories listed in the PATH environment variable. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL named `atiadlxx.dll` in a writable directory within the PATH, which will then be loaded by the service. The service does not validate the digital signature of the loaded DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local privilege escalation. By loading a malicious DLL into the `poaService.exe` service, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to write to a directory included in the system's PATH environment variable.
