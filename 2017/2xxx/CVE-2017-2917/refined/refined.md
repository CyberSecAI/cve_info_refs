The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2917.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the "id" property within the "notification" element of the `configure.xml` file. This unsanitized input is then used within a `system()` call, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the command injection via the `system()` call. The "id" attribute from the XML is directly passed to the system command without any sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device by crafting a malicious "id" value in the `configure.xml` file. In the provided example, the attacker is able to make the device's LED blink rapidly, but any arbitrary command could be executed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Packets:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the device to restore a malicious configuration backup. The crafted `configure.xml` file is included in the backup.
- **API Endpoint:** The specific API endpoint used to trigger the vulnerability is `/api/CONFIG/restore`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
- **Valid Token:** The attacker needs a valid token to authenticate with the device's API.
