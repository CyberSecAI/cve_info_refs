**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Loading (CWE-427):** The installer was vulnerable to loading executable files from untrusted locations due to how it searched for required files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited locally by placing a malicious executable in the same directory as the installer or a specific subdirectory of the Vivaldi installation folder (for the delta upgrade).
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into downloading the malicious executable into the correct directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the user to download a malicious executable file to the same directory where the Vivaldi installer was downloaded, or, for delta upgrades, to a specific subdirectory of the Vivaldi installation folder.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affected Vivaldi installers for Windows prior to version 1.7.735.48.
- The delta upgrade mechanism was also affected by this issue.
- The vulnerability was addressed in versions 1.7.735.48 (for installer) and 1.8 (for delta upgrades).
