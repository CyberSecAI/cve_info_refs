The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2154.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue with the DLL search path used by Hanako and multiple software suites containing Hanako. This leads to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Insecure DLL loading. The application does not properly validate the location of the DLLs it loads, allowing it to load malicious DLLs from an attacker-controlled location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack vectors:**
Local. The attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application would load it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to write a malicious DLL to a location where the vulnerable application will search and load DLLs. User interaction (running the application) is required for the exploit to take effect.
