- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file permission configuration in some Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak due to incorrect file permissions. The file containing the cipher text of the SIM card PIN is accessible to malicious applications.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain the file containing the encrypted SIM card PIN, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or usage of the SIM card.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application. This application then exploits the file permission vulnerability to access the sensitive file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to develop a malicious application and convince the user to install it on their Huawei smartphone. The attacker does not require any special network access or elevated privileges on the device itself to exploit the vulnerability after the application is installed.
