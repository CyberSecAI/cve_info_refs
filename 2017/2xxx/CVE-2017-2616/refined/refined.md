{
  "CVE-2017-2616": {
    "description": "A race condition was found in the way su handled the management of child processes. A local authenticated attacker could use this flaw to kill other processes with root privileges under specific conditions.",
    "root_cause": "Race condition in su's handling of child processes, specifically clearing the child PID.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "Local authenticated attacker could kill other processes with root privileges, leading to a denial of service. This attack can target processes started after the `su` command. It is not possible to kill processes that were already running.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local authenticated user capable of executing `su` commands, even to the same user.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when 'su' is compiled with PAM support. The attacker does not need to 'su' to the root user for the exploit to work. The attacker can use 'su $(whoami)' to exploit the issue. The kill command is sent via SIGKILL or SIGTERM to the targeted processes"
