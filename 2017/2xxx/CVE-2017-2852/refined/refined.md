- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of itemlist deserialization within the NWStorage service of Natus Xltek NeuroWorks 8. Specifically, the software does not properly validate the length of items within an itemlist during deserialization.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Out-of-bounds read: By providing a crafted itemlist with an invalid item length, the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer during deserialization.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the NWStorage service to crash and become unavailable.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - Network packets: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet containing a malformed itemlist to the NWStorage service.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - Network access: The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target system running the vulnerable NWStorage service.
    - No special privileges are required.
