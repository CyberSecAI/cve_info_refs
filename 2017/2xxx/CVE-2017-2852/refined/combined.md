# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0354

## Natus Xltek EEG NeuroWorks ItemList Deserialization Denial-of-Service Vulnerability

##### May 31, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2852

### Summary

An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the unserialization of lists functionality of Natus Xltek NeuroWorks 8. A specially crafted network packet can cause an out-of-bounds read, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Natus Xltek NeuroWorks 8

### Product URLs

[http://www.natus.com](http://www.natus.com/index.cfm?page=products_1&crid=224)

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read

### Details

Natus NeuroWorks 8 provides a networking solution for the Natus Xltek EEG products. In particular, it is used to monitor and review study data from anywhere on the network. This advisory looks into the NWStorage service bundled with NeuroWorks.

Upon reception of data, NWStorage attempts to unserialize the data passed to it. NWStorage recognizes a variety of data types, two of which are a string and itemlist. The serialized format for the string type is shown below:

```
char type;  // 2 in the case of string
int length; // Length of the string plus 5 bytes for the header
char[length] string; // The string itself

```

The serialized format for the itemlist type is similar and shown below:

```
char type;    // 4 in the case of itemlist
int elements; // Number of elements in the itemlist
Item[elements] data; // Simple array of Items

```

The process of unserializing the items in the list can be summarized in the following pseudocode:

```
total_num_elements = itemlist.elements;
current_num_elements = 0;
while ( 1 )
{
    current_item = UnserializeItem(itemlist_pointer);
    if ( !current_item )
        break;

    itemlist_pointer += current_item.length;
    if ( ++current_num_elements >= total_num_elements )
        return 1;
}

```

NWStorage honors the number of elements specified in the itemlist header and proceeds to attempt to unserialize that many items. The next item to be unserialized is determined by the length specified in that item’s header. The unserialization of a generic item is shown below:

```
.text:23002492 018                 mov     edi, [esp+18h+buf] // Current Item buffer
.text:23002496 018                 test    edi, edi
.text:23002498 018                 jz      loc_2300261C    ; jumptable 230024B8 default case
.text:2300249E 018                 mov     esi, 5
.text:230024A3 018                 cmp     [edi+1], esi // Out of bounds

```

By providing an invalid length on an item, NWStorage will attempt to add a wrong number of bytes to the current serialized buffer. If this new location is out of bounds, the comparison at `0x230024A3` will crash the service, resulting in a denial of service.

### Crash Information

```
