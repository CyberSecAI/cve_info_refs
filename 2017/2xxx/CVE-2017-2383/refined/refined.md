**Root cause of vulnerability:** A client certificate was sent in plaintext.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The client certificate was transmitted without encryption.
**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a privileged network position could track a user's activity.
**Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attack on the network could intercept the plaintext certificate.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be in a privileged network position to intercept network traffic.
