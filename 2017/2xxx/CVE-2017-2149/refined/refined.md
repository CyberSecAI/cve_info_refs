Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2149:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the installers of multiple Toshiba memory card related software regarding the DLL search path. The installers do not securely handle the loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427): The installers are susceptible to loading malicious DLLs due to an improperly configured search path. This can allow an attacker to substitute a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This can lead to a complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack: An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched by the vulnerable installer, and then induce a user to run the vulnerable installer.
- User interaction: Exploitation requires the user to run the vulnerable installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched by the vulnerable installer.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into running the vulnerable installer.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present only in the installers and not in the installed applications. Therefore, users who have already installed the software do not need to reinstall it to mitigate the vulnerability, but should be sure to use the latest installer if they need to install the software again.
- The affected software includes various tools related to Toshiba SDHC/SDXC memory cards, such as software update tools and configuration software for different series of cards with embedded NFC, wireless LAN (FlashAir), and TransferJet functionality.
- The provided CVSS scores indicate a high severity vulnerability. CVSS v3 gives it a score of 7.8 with high impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability, while v2 has a score of 6.8 with partial impact for all three.
