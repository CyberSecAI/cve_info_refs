Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The installer of Tera Term versions 4.94 and earlier has a flaw in how it searches for and loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). It does not properly validate the location of DLLs, leading to insecure DLL loading. This is a classic example of a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The installer searches for DLLs in locations that are not secure, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL in one of these locations. This allows arbitrary code to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the vulnerable installer.
- **Complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability:** As the attacker can execute arbitrary code, they can potentially take complete control over the system if it has high privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a specific location that the installer searches before legitimate DLL files.
- **User Interaction:** The user must run the vulnerable installer to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to write to a vulnerable path:**  The attacker needs to be able to place their malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable installer searches.
- **User Action Required**: The attacker needs to get the user to execute the vulnerable installer.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in the installer only and does not affect already installed Tera Term applications.
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.8 (High) with vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The CVSS v2 score is 6.8 with vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
- The analysis assumes the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file prepared by the attacker in a specific folder.
