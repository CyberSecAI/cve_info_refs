Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-2423:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A validation issue existed with cryptographic API calls, specifically with the `SecKeyRawVerify()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper parameter validation in the `SecKeyRawVerify()` function.
- The function could unexpectedly succeed when validating empty signatures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially bypass signature verification.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this by crafting inputs to the `SecKeyRawVerify()` function that contain empty signatures.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to make calls to the `SecKeyRawVerify()` API. This would likely require the attacker to have some level of control over an application running on the affected system.

**Affected Products:**
- iOS 10.3
- macOS Sierra 10.12.4
- Security Update 2017-001 El Capitan
- Security Update 2017-001 Yosemite
