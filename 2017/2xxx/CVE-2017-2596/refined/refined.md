{
  "CVE-2017-2596": {
    "Description": "The KVM module in the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is enabled, has a page reference leak in the `handle_vmon` function while emulating the VMXON instruction. This allows a malicious L1 guest user to leak host memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `handle_vmon` function acquires a reference to the VMXON region page but fails to release it under certain circumstances.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Page reference leak.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Host memory leak, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious L1 guest user can trigger this vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have control over a virtual machine configured to use nested virtualization."
