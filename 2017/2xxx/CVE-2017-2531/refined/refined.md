Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-2531:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An incorrect check within the `emitPutDerivedConstructorToArrowFunctionContextScope` function in WebKit's JavaScriptCore (JSC) bytecode generator. Specifically, the logic for determining when to allocate space for `derivedConstructorPrivateName` in the arrow function context scope was inconsistent between `initializeArrowFunctionContextScopeIfNeeded` and `emitPutDerivedConstructorToArrowFunctionContextScope` leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability arises when the `emitPutToScope` function is called without proper scope initialization, causing a write outside allocated memory bounds. This occurs due to the inconsistent checks in `initializeArrowFunctionContextScopeIfNeeded` and `emitPutDerivedConstructorToArrowFunctionContextScope` in `BytecodeGenerator`.
- **Logic Error**: The core issue is a logic error in the bytecode generation process which results in not allocating enough memory in certain cases when super is called from inner arrow functions within a class context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The exploit can trigger an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to application crashes and denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The document from Apple mentions that in general, processing maliciously crafted web content via WebKit may lead to arbitrary code execution. While this exploit is tagged as DoS, it's possible under some circumstances, such an out-of-bounds write might be exploitable for code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted web content:** The primary attack vector is through web content that exploits the vulnerable JavaScript code path, causing the JSC bytecode generator to perform an out-of-bounds write.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** An attacker would need to deliver or host the malicious web content to a vulnerable system through methods like hosting a webpage, injecting javascript into a website.
- **Understanding of WebKit and JSC:** The attacker needs to be able to craft JavaScript code that triggers the specific vulnerability within the bytecode generation process. The exploit requires specific conditions related to class inheritance, arrow functions and super calls.

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit detailed in exploit-db involves a complex set of nested class definitions with arrow functions and super calls.
- The exploit involves creating a large array of dummy arguments which are used in an arrow function within the constructor of a class that extends another class. This triggers the vulnerability during bytecode generation, resulting in the out-of-bounds write.
- Patches involve improvements to memory handling and state management in WebKit.
- The apple documents also mention the use of improved memory handling to fix similar memory corruption issues.
