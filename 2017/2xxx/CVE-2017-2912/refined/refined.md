- **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `goclient` binary in Circle with Disney devices uses `strstr()` to check the Common Name (CN) attribute of the SSL certificate, specifically searching for "CN=\*.meetcircle.com". This flawed check allows an attacker to bypass the intended domain name verification.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The vulnerability lies in the weak and incomplete validation of the SSL certificate's common name. Instead of performing an exact match or a more secure check of the subject alternative names, it uses `strstr()` which allows for other domain names containing the targeted string, like `*.meetcircle.computer` to pass the check.
    - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** The inadequate certificate check makes the device susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful MITM attack could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate the communication between the Circle with Disney device and the remote server. This could lead to unauthorized access and control of the device's settings, filtering rules, and potentially the connected network. The attacker can then perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker positions themselves between the Circle with Disney device and the remote server (`vpncc.meetcircle.co`).
    - **Malicious SSL Certificate:** The attacker hosts an HTTPS server that presents a valid SSL certificate signed by a trusted CA (Comodo) with a Common Name that contains "CN=\*.meetcircle.com" as a substring (e.g., `*.meetcircle.computer`).
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Circle with Disney device or have the ability to intercept traffic between the device and the remote server.
    - **SSL Certificate:** The attacker needs to have a valid SSL certificate signed by the Comodo CA with a malicious CN.
    - **Domain Name:** The attacker needs to purchase a domain name that is a valid subdomain of 'meetcircle' (e.g., meetcircle.community, meetcircle.company, meetcircle.computer) to leverage the weakness in the certificate check.
