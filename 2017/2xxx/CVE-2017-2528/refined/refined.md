Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2528:

**Root Cause:**
- A logic issue existed in the handling of WebKit cached frames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper state management in how WebKit handles cached frames.
- Specifically, when a subframe is cached, the parent frame is detached, but not the opener frame. This can lead to a subframe inheriting the security origin of its opener frame, which should not happen.
- When a document loads "about:blank" or "about:srcdoc", it tries to inherit the security origin from its parent frame, or its opener frame if the parent frame doesn't exist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to universal cross-site scripting (UXSS). This means an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a different origin than the attacker's webpage, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user on the affected domain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through processing maliciously crafted web content.
- An attacker would need to craft a webpage that uses specific techniques to trigger the vulnerability related to cached frames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website visited by the victim.
- The victim needs to visit this malicious website using a vulnerable version of Safari or WebKitGTK+.

**Technical Details (from exploit-db):**
- The `Document::initSecurityContext` function in WebKit is responsible for setting the security context.
- A check is performed to see if the document URL is "about:blank" or "about:srcdoc".
- If so, it attempts to inherit the security origin from its parent or opener frame.
- The vulnerability occurs when a cached subframe has its parent detached but the opener frame is not, which leads to inheriting the wrong security origin.

**Proof of Concept:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to create a new window that loads an iframe.
- The PoC then navigates the opener window to a different domain.
- Finally, it sets the `srcdoc` attribute of the iframe, causing the subframe to inherit the opener's origin and enabling the execution of JavaScript code in the context of the opener frame.
