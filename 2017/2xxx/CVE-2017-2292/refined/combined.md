# MCollective: Remote Code Execution — GLSA **201709-01**

A vulnerability in MCollective might allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/mcollective** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.0** |

### Background

MCollective is a framework to build server orchestration or parallel job
execution systems.

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered in MCollective which allowed for
deserialized YAML from agents without calling safe\_load. This allows the
potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MCollective users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/mcollective-2.11.0"

```
