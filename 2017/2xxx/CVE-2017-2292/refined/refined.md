- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the deserialization of YAML data from agents without using `safe_load`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization of YAML data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the MCollective process or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can send malicious YAML payloads to the MCollective server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker capable of sending requests to the MCollective server.
