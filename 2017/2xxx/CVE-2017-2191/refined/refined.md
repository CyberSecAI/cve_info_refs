Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-2191:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure DLL search path used by the RW-5100 driver installer for Windows 7 and 8.1. The affected installers do not properly validate the location of DLLs they load, potentially leading to the loading of malicious DLLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-427:**  Uncontrolled Search Path Element. The installer searches for DLLs in a predictable or controllable location where an attacker could place a malicious DLL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable installer. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must place a malicious DLL in a specific directory that the installer will search when loading libraries.
- **User Interaction:** The user must execute the vulnerable installer to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file on the victim's system in a location where the vulnerable installer will attempt to load the DLL from.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into running the vulnerable installer.

**Affected Products (CVE-2017-2191 Specific):**
- RW-5100 driver installer for Windows 7 version 1.0.0.9A (RW5100V1.0.0.9\_A\_win.exe) and earlier
- RW-5100 driver installer for Windows 8.1 version 1.0.1.0A (RW5100V1.0.1.0\_A\_win8.exe) and earlier

**Mitigation:**
-  Upgrade to the latest installer versions:
  - RW-5100 driver installer for Windows 7 version 1.2.0.0 (RW51Inst.exe)
  - RW-5100 driver installer for Windows 8.1 version 1.2.0.0 (RW51Inst.exe)

**Additional Information:**
- The analysis provided in the document assumes the attacker has tricked a user into placing the malicious DLL.
- This vulnerability affects only the installers, not the installed driver software.
- CVSS v3 score: 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- CVSS v2 score: 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
