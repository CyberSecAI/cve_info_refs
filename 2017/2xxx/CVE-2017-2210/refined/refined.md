- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installers have an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installers.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to prepare a malicious DLL and trick the user into placing it in a specific folder that is searched by the installer during execution. The user must then execute the vulnerable installer.
