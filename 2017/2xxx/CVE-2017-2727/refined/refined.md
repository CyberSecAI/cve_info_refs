- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unauthenticated attacker can bypass the phone activation process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation, bypassing phone activation, lack of authentication during initial setup process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the phone activation, access the user management page, create a new user, and operate part of the phone's functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the phone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have physical access to a Huawei smartphone that has not been activated yet, such as a lost or stolen phone. The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
