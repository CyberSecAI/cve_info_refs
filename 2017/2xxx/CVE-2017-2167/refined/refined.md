Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2167:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insecure file search path vulnerability in the installer of the PrimeDrive Desktop Application. The installer does not properly validate the location of executable files it loads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The installer searches for executable files in locations not secured or controlled. This means that if a malicious file is placed in a location checked by the installer it could be executed instead of the legitimate file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the installer. This means the attacker gains the ability to run any programs, install malware, or perform any other actions allowed by the compromised user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited during the software installation process. The attack is local as it occurs when the installer is executed on the user's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to get the user to run the installer.
*   **Local File Placement:** An attacker needs to place a malicious executable file in a location that the installer searches during its execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only affects the installer and not the application itself. Thus, users who have already installed the application are not vulnerable unless they re-run the installer.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by using the latest installer provided by the vendor.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 7.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*   The attack complexity is low since the vulnerability is due to a path issue, which is easily exploited if the attacker can place a malicious file in the path.
