                 CVE-2017-6001 CVE-2017-6074

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other
impacts.

CVE-2016-6786 / CVE-2016-6787

    It was discovered that the performance events subsystem does not
    properly manage locks during certain migrations, allowing a local
    attacker to escalate privileges.  This can be mitigated by
    disabling unprivileged use of performance events:
    sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3

CVE-2016-8405

    Peter Pi of Trend Micro discovered that the frame buffer video
    subsystem does not properly check bounds while copying color maps to
    userspace, causing a heap buffer out-of-bounds read, leading to
    information disclosure.

CVE-2016-9191

    CAI Qian discovered that reference counting is not properly handled
    within proc_sys_readdir in the sysctl implementation, allowing a
    local denial of service (system hang) or possibly privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-2583

    Xiaohan Zhang reported that KVM for amd64 does not correctly
    emulate loading of a null stack selector.  This can be used by a
    user in a guest VM for denial of service (on an Intel CPU) or to
    escalate privileges within the VM (on an AMD CPU).

CVE-2017-2584

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that KVM for x86 does not correctly emulate
    memory access by the SGDT and SIDT instructions, which can result
    in a use-after-free and information leak.

CVE-2017-2596

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that KVM leaks page references when
    emulating a VMON for a nested hypervisor.  This can be used by a
    privileged user in a guest VM for denial of service or possibly
    to gain privileges in the host.

CVE-2017-2618

    It was discovered that an off-by-one in the handling of SELinux
    attributes in /proc/pid/attr could result in local denial of
    service.

CVE-2017-5549

    It was discovered that the KLSI KL5KUSB105 serial USB device
    driver could log the contents of uninitialised kernel memory,
    resulting in an information leak.

CVE-2017-5551

    Jan Kara found that changing the POSIX ACL of a file on tmpfs never
    cleared its set-group-ID flag, which should be done if the user
    changing it is not a member of the group-owner. In some cases, this
    would allow the user-owner of an executable to gain the privileges
    of the group-owner.

CVE-2017-5897

    Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read flaw in the
    ip6gre_err function in the IPv6 networking code.

CVE-2017-5970

    Andrey Konovalov discovered a denial-of-service flaw in the IPv4
    networking code.  This can be triggered by a local or remote
    attacker if a local UDP or raw socket has the IP_RETOPTS option
    enabled.

CVE-2017-6001

    Di Shen discovered a race condition between concurrent calls to
    the performance events subsystem, allowing a local attacker to
    escalate privileges. This flaw exists because of an incomplete fix
    of CVE-2016-6786.  This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged
    use of performance events: sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3

CVE-2017-6074

    Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the
    DCCP networking code, which could result in denial of service or
    local privilege escalation.  On systems that do not already have
    the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.39-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

KVM: x86: emulate FXSAVE and FXRSTOR

```
Internal errors were reported on 16 bit fxsave and fxrstor with ipxe.
Old Intels don't have unrestricted_guest, so we have to emulate them.

The patch takes advantage of the hardware implementation.

AMD and Intel differ in saving and restoring other fields in first 32
bytes.  A test wrote 0xff to the fxsave area, 0 to upper bits of MCSXR
in the fxsave area, executed fxrstor, rewrote the fxsave area to 0xee,
and executed fxsave:

  Intel (Nehalem):
    7f 1f 7f 7f ff 00 ff 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00
    ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00
  Intel (Haswell -- deprecated FPU CS and FPU DS):
    7f 1f 7f 7f ff 00 ff 07 ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00
    ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00
  AMD (Opteron 2300-series):
    7f 1f 7f 7f ff 00 ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee
    ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ff ff 00 00 ff ff 02 00

fxsave/fxrstor will only be emulated on early Intels, so KVM can't do
much to improve the situation.

Subject: CVE-2017-2584 Kernel: kvm: use after free in
 complete_emulated_mmio

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) support
is vulnerable to a use after free flaw. It could occur on x86 platform, when
emulating instructions fxsave, fxrstor, sgdt, etc.

A user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg143571.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413001>

'CVE-2017-2584' is assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.

KVM: x86: emulate FXSAVE and FXRSTOR

```
Internal errors were reported on 16 bit fxsave and fxrstor with ipxe.
Old Intels don't have unrestricted_guest, so we have to emulate them.

The patch takes advantage of the hardware implementation.

AMD and Intel differ in saving and restoring other fields in first 32
bytes.  A test wrote 0xff to the fxsave area, 0 to upper bits of MCSXR
in the fxsave area, executed fxrstor, rewrote the fxsave area to 0xee,
and executed fxsave:

  Intel (Nehalem):
    7f 1f 7f 7f ff 00 ff 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00
    ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00
  Intel (Haswell -- deprecated FPU CS and FPU DS):
    7f 1f 7f 7f ff 00 ff 07 ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00
    ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00
  AMD (Opteron 2300-series):
    7f 1f 7f 7f ff 00 ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee
    ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ff ff 00 00 ff ff 02 00

fxsave/fxrstor will only be emulated on early Intels, so KVM can't do
much to improve the situation.

KVM: x86: Introduce segmented\_write\_std

```
Introduces segemented_write_std.

Switches from emulated reads/writes to standard read/writes in fxsave,
fxrstor, sgdt, and sidt.  This fixes [CVE-2017-2584](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jhcg-4vw7-q849 "CVE-2017-2584"), a longstanding
kernel memory leak.

Since commit [283c95d](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/283c95d0e3891b64087706b344a4b545d04a6e62) ("KVM: x86: emulate FXSAVE and FXRSTOR",
2016-11-09), which is luckily not yet in any final release, this would
also be an exploitable kernel memory *write*!

KVM: x86: Introduce segmented\_write\_stdIntroduces segemented\_write\_std.
Switches from emulated reads/writes to standard read/writes in fxsave,
fxrstor, sgdt, and sidt. This fixes CVE-2017-2584, a longstanding
kernel memory leak.
Since commit 283c95d0e389 ("KVM: x86: emulate FXSAVE and FXRSTOR",
2016-11-09), which is luckily not yet in any final release, this would
also be an exploitable kernel memory \*write\*!

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1413001#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2017-01-13 11:30:34 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) support is vulnerable to a use after free flaw. It could occur on x86 platform, when emulating instructions fxsave, fxrstor, sgdt, etc.  A user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS.  Upstream patch: ---------------   -> <https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg143571.html>  Reference: ----------   -> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/01/13/7>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1413001#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2017-01-13 11:32:08 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1413002](show_bug.cgi?id=1413002 "CLOSED INSUFFICIENT_DATA - CVE-2017-2584 Kernel: kvm: use after free in complete_emulated_mmio [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1413001#c6)  Prasad Pandit    2017-03-31 09:46:28 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  This issue affects the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.  This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
