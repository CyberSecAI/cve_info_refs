Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) implementation for x86 architecture within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue arises from incorrect emulation of memory access by the `SGDT` and `SIDT` instructions, as well as the `fxsave` and `fxrstor` instructions when running in a 16-bit or 32-bit mode guest on a 64-bit host. This flawed emulation resulted in a use-after-free condition and a potential information leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** When the kernel emulates the aforementioned instructions, incorrect memory management occurs, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Information Leak:** Due to the incorrect emulation of memory accesses by the affected instructions, a guest VM could potentially leak host kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user/process could trigger the use-after-free condition, causing the host kernel to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Information Leak:** An attacker within the guest VM could leverage this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the host kernel memory. This could potentially aid in further attacks against the host system.
- **Potential Kernel Memory Write (after commit 283c95d):** After the introduction of commit `283c95d`, the use-after-free could be exploited to write to kernel memory, making it even more severe.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to a guest virtual machine running under KVM. The vulnerable code is within the kernel's KVM module, so an attacker needs to trigger it using the specified instructions within the context of a guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest virtual machine.
- The guest VM must be running on a vulnerable Linux kernel with KVM support enabled for x86 architecture.
- The guest OS must use 16-bit or 32-bit mode, while the host uses 64-bit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dmitry Vyukov.
- A patch was developed to fix the vulnerability by introducing `segmented_write_std` and switching from emulated reads/writes to standard reads/writes for the affected instructions (`fxsave`, `fxrstor`, `sgdt`, and `sidt`).
- The vulnerability was fixed in the Linux kernel with commit `129a72a0d3c8e139a04512325384fe5ac119e74d`.
- The issue is present in Linux kernel versions up to 4.9.3.
- This was a longstanding kernel memory leak.
- Red Hat has marked the severity as "low" and does not plan to address the issue with an update.
