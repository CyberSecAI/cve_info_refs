Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-2246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by the installers of Lhaz.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-427, which refers to "Uncontrolled Search Path Element". This means the application's installer does not properly specify the directories to search for DLLs, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking/planting attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user who runs the vulnerable installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched by the vulnerable installer before the intended legitimate DLL. The attacker would need to entice the user to run the installer in a context where the malicious DLL would be loaded first.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location searched by the installer. The attacker would then need to make a user execute the installer. User interaction is required, making the UI requirement "R" in the CVSS vector.
