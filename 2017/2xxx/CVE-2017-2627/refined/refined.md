Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2627:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from overly permissive entries in the `sudoers` file included in the `openstack-tripleo-common` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Wildcard Usage Allowing Directory Traversal:** The `sudoers` file contains lines for the `mistral` user that use wildcards, allowing directory traversal via the use of `..`.
2. **Full Passwordless Root Access:** The `validations` user is granted complete passwordless root access through the `sudoers` configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who gains control of the `mistral` user could potentially exploit the wildcard vulnerability to execute commands in arbitrary directories. The more significant impact is that any attacker gaining access to `validations` user will have full passwordless root access on the system. This allows for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the improperly configured `sudoers` file via either the `mistral` or `validations` user. Specifically:
  - For `mistral`, the attack would involve executing commands by leveraging the directory traversal vulnerability.
  - For `validations`, any command executed through sudo will be executed as root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. An attacker must gain access to the `mistral` user to exploit the wildcard directory traversal issue.
2. An attacker needs to gain access to the `validations` user to gain full root access via `sudo`.
