- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of air interface messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of data received over the air interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can tamper with air interface signaling messages, potentially gaining access to some communication information.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker must set up a rogue base station to send forged air interface messages to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within range to communicate with the target device via a rogue base station. No authentication is required.
