- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a command injection vulnerability in the `delAccount` function of the `CGIProxy.fcgi` service. The service does not properly sanitize user-provided input when deleting a user account. Specifically, the username, which is extracted from the HTTP request, is used in a format string passed to the `system` call, allowing for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Command injection: The application constructs a shell command using user-supplied data without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
  - Lack of input validation: The application doesn't restrict the characters allowed in the username, which allows injection of shell metacharacters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the webserver, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi` endpoint.
  - The attacker manipulates the `usrName` parameter within the HTTP request when using the `delAccount` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.
  - The attacker needs a valid user account with administrator privileges to add and delete other accounts.
