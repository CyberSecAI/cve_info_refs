{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `skyring-setup` command creates a random password for the MongoDB skyring database but writes it in plain text to `/etc/skyring/skyring.conf`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The configuration file `/etc/skyring/skyring.conf` is world-readable, allowing any local user to access the plain text MongoDB password.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can obtain the plain text password for the skyring MongoDB database, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system running the skyring service is required to read the configuration file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any local user on the system is able to exploit this vulnerability."
