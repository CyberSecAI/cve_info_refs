- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software provides a system interface for interaction with external applications, but calling the interface is not properly restricted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposed system interface without proper access controls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could modify system properties by calling the exposed interface.
- **Attack vectors:** Installation of a malicious application by the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious app on the phone.
