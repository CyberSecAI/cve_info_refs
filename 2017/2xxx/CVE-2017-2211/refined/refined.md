- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installers have an issue with the DLL search path, causing them to insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** Local. An attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder where the installer will load it from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer searches for DLLs. This likely requires some level of access to the user's system. The user must then run the vulnerable installer.
