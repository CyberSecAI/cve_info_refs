- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the Push module in Huawei Smart Phones not verifying file names during decompression, which allows directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability due to lack of filename validation during decompression.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can replace files on the system, impacting the service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick the user into decompressing a malicious file on the smartphone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious file, and then trick a user into decompressing the file on the affected device.
