- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installers for Sony PaSoRi driver software and related software have a flaw in how they search for and load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). Specifically, they do not use secure DLL loading practices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)). The installers are vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack involves placing a malicious DLL file in a location where the vulnerable installer will search for it. The user must then execute the vulnerable installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL in a location searched by the installer. The user must then be tricked into running the installer.
