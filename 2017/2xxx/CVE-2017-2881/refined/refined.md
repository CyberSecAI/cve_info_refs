- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `check_torlist.sh` script in Circle with Disney firmware downloads a list of Tor addresses via HTTP and extracts it using `tar`. This allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by intercepting and modifying the HTTP response to serve a malicious tarball.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Insecure download of the torlist via HTTP, instead of HTTPS, which allows interception and modification of the response.
    - Unrestricted extraction of the downloaded tarball into the `/tmp` directory, leading to arbitrary file overwrite.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** By supplying a malicious tarball, the attacker can overwrite files in the `/tmp` directory, including system binaries like `wget`, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. An attacker intercepts the HTTP request from the Circle device and sends a crafted HTTP response containing a malicious tarball.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Circle device and the `meetcircle.co` domain. This could be achieved by being on the same network as the device or having a position to control the network path.
    - The attacker needs to be able to alter the HTTP response from the `meetcircle.co` server.
