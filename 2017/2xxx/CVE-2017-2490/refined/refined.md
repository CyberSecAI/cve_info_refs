Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-2490:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory corruption issue due to improper memory handling.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges (kernel privileges or root privileges).

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target device. This likely requires the ability to install and run an application on the affected system.

**Platforms Affected:**
- watchOS 3.2
- macOS Sierra 10.12.3
- iOS 10.3
- tvOS 10.2

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero and The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
- The exploit-db entry provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability's root cause in the fsevents device driver and also provides exploit code
- The issue is a double-free due to bad locking in the fsevents device driver. The locking mechanism used to protect `devices_not_to_watch` is insufficient.
- Two threads can read the same value of `devices_not_to_watch`, assign it to a local variable, and then free it, resulting in a double-free vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can lead to an exploitable kernel use-after-free condition if combined with racing allocations.
- Access to `/dev/fsevents` is restricted to root users, so the exploit is a privilege escalation from root to kernel.
