Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2583:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from multiple sources (Red Hat Bugzilla, Openwall, Red Hat Security Advisories, and the Linux kernel commit) all confirm that they are referring to CVE-2017-2583. Specifically, the bug relates to an incorrect implementation of loading a segment selector(SS) in the KVM module, and the potential to cause guest crashes and privilege escalation.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module of the Linux kernel, specifically in the `load_segment_descriptor` implementation within `arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c`. The vulnerability exists because of how the kernel handles the "MOV SS, NULL selector" instruction, used to load the Stack Segment register (SS) with a null selector, specifically in a 64-bit environment.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Handling of Null Selectors:** The KVM implementation fails to properly emulate the "MOV SS, NULL selector" instruction when executed in long mode (64-bit mode).
*   **Missing Checks:**  The kernel doesn't properly check the Segment Selector (SS) type when loaded with a null selector, this results in a failed vmentry on Intel. Also, it doesn't set the Control Privilege Level (CPL) and Segment Descriptor Privilege Level (SS.DPL) when loading the null segment selector. 
*   **Data Descriptor Fabrication**:  On AMD CPUs, it is worse, the system will incorrectly set the CPL to 0.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause the guest operating system to crash on Intel CPUs due to a failed vmentry.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** On AMD CPUs, the faulty CPL setting can potentially allow attackers to escalate their privileges inside the guest OS. This allows an attacker to potentially run arbitrary code with elevated privileges within the guest environment.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest OS User:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a user or process running within a guest virtual machine.
*   **Malicious Application:** An attacker can trigger this flaw by executing a specifically crafted application within the guest VM that loads a null selector into the stack segment register.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Execution:** The attacker needs to have the capability to execute code within a guest virtual machine.
*   **Privileged access:** The attacker requires user or process privileges inside the guest VM.

**Technical Details and Descriptions (from the Linux kernel commit message):**

> On Intel this causes a failed vmentry because
SS's type is neither 3 nor 7 (even though the manual says this check is
only done for usable SS, and the dmesg splat says that SS is unusable!).
On AMD it's worse: svm.c is confused and sets CPL to 0 in the vmcb.
The fix fabricates a data segment descriptor when SS is set to a null
selector, so that CPL and SS.DPL are set correctly in the VMCS/vmcb.
Furthermore, only allow setting SS to a NULL selector if SS.RPL < 3;
this in turn ensures CPL < 3 because RPL must be equal to CPL.

**Additional Points:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to 4.9.5.
*   The fix involved modifying  `arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c` and fabricating a data segment descriptor when the `SS` is set to a null selector. The fix also enforces a check to ensure CPL is set correctly.
*   The fix involved a check to ensure the RPL (Requested Privilege Level) of SS is less than 3 to prevent exploitation from CPL 3.

In summary, CVE-2017-2583 is a critical vulnerability in the Linux kernel's KVM module that can potentially be exploited by a guest user to cause DoS, or more significantly, gain higher privileges within the guest. The root cause is improper emulation of the `MOV SS, NULL selector` instruction in the virtualized environment.
