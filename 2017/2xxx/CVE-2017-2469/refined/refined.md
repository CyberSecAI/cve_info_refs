Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2017-2469:

**Root Cause:**
*   A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `JSC::SymbolTableEntry::isWatchable` function within the JavaScriptCore component of WebKit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap buffer overflow:** The vulnerability arises due to a boundary check issue when accessing memory. Specifically, the `isWatchable()` function attempts to read from a location that is outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit code causes a crash, which demonstrates the potential for a DoS attack.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the provided proof of concept only demonstrates a crash, the underlying memory corruption may, in some scenarios, be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, given the right conditions and further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Web Content:**  The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted JavaScript code, making it exploitable through a malicious website or other content delivered via web technologies (e.g., HTML email, embedded browsers).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to deliver malicious javascript:** The attacker needs to be able to inject or get the victim to execute crafted javascript. This can be done by hosting a website with malicious content, or through other methods of injecting script into a web browser.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) consists of a JavaScript code snippet that triggers the crash by causing a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   The crash occurs within the `JSC::SymbolTableEntry::isWatchable()` function, specifically during a read operation.
*   The provided ASan log indicates a read of 8 bytes at an address that is 8 bytes beyond the allocated 128-byte region.
*   The ASan log provides a detailed call stack leading to the crash, including `JSC::SymbolTable::cloneScopePart()` and other `JSC` functions that are important to understanding the context and execution flow leading to the vulnerability.

**Affected software:**
* Safari 10.1
* iOS 10.3
* tvOS 10.2
* WebKitGTK+ prior to version 2.16.3

The provided information gives more detail than the original CVE description in that it describes the vulnerable function and provides a functional proof of concept with an ASan crash log.
