Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow (CWE-119):** The software does not properly validate the size of user-supplied input, potentially allowing an attacker to write past the end of a buffer in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected device. This could lead to full compromise of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attack can be performed from an adjacent network. This implies that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device or have access to it through routing or bridging.
*   The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N), or authentication (PR:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker does not need any user credentials to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in multiple I-O DATA network camera products.
* The vulnerability is described in conjunction with CVE-2017-2112, which also leads to arbitrary OS command execution.
* The vulnerability was reported by Taizoh Tsukamoto of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
