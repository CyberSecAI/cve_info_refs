  "CVE-2017-2671": {
    "description": "A race condition, leading to a NULL pointer dereference, was found in the Linux kernel's Link Layer Control implementation. A local attacker with access to ping sockets could use this flaw to corrupt kernel memory leading to a kernel crash or privilege escalation.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the Linux kernel's Link Layer Control (LLC) implementation when using ping sockets. Specifically, the `sin_family` field within the `sockaddr_in` structure is not properly protected when the socket is connected, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference if not properly initialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
       "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper synchronization"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this race condition to corrupt kernel memory, potentially leading to a system crash (Denial of Service) or, in some cases, privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have access to a ping socket and the ability to rapidly connect to it while manipulating the sockaddr structure.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to create and interact with ping sockets (requires CAP_NET_RAW capability). The vulnerability may be more easily exploited if unprivileged user namespaces are enabled which allows a non-privileged user to gain the required CAP_NET_RAW capability. Note that this is not a standard configuration.",
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists in the `ping_unhash` function of the kernel, and the fix involves acquiring the ping table lock earlier to prevent concurrent access. It was introduced by an erroneous optimization during a forward-port to 2.6's hlists. The fix involves ensuring the `disconnect()` function is called with the socket lock held."
