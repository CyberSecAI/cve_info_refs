- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OpenFire User Import Export Plugin 2.6.0 is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to improper handling of XML input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity (XXE) injection (CWE-611). The application processes XML data without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to include external entities.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Retrieval of arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) by forcing the server to read from special files like `/dev/random`.
    - Port scanning of internal network via the XML parser.
    - Retrieval of sensitive web content that would be normally inaccessible due to network topology.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A specially crafted web request containing malicious XML is sent to the server.
    - Attack can be triggered via Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or by exploiting compromised user accounts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs to be authenticated to the application or able to perform a CSRF attack.
