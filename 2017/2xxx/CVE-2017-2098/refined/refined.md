The provided content describes a directory traversal vulnerability in CubeCart versions prior to 6.1.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw within the CubeCart software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22), allowing access to files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can access local files on the server.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (remote).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted request to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.  The JPCERT/CC analysis indicates that a low privilege level is sufficient for exploitation.
