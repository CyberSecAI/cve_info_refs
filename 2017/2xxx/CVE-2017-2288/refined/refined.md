- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer of LhaForge has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the user invoking the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker can trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder, which is then loaded by the LhaForge installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will find it and the user must run the vulnerable installer.
