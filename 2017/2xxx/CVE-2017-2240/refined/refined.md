Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2017-2240: Directory Traversal Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The AssetView for MacOS file transfer web service has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server's file system.
*   **Weakness:** Directory Traversal (CWE-22). The vulnerability is located in the file transfer web service, which handles communication between the server and MacOS clients. It appears that the service does not properly sanitize user inputs when accessing files, allowing an attacker to request files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who can access the server can retrieve arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files containing credentials and system data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based. An attacker needs network access to the server where the AssetView file transfer web service is running.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the server where the vulnerable file transfer web service is running.  This is described as "an attacker who can access the server".

**Summary**

The provided information describes a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2017-2240) in the AssetView for MacOS file transfer web service. An attacker with network access to the server could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.  The content also refers to CVE-2017-2241 (SQL injection) which is not the focus of this analysis, but is mentioned in the context of a related vulnerability within the same service.
