The content is related to CVE-2017-2811.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect calculation of buffer size when parsing an unknown marker within a JPEG 2000 file using the Kakadu SDK. Specifically, the size field of the unknown marker is misinterpreted, leading to the allocation of a buffer that is too small.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect calculation of buffer size (CWE-131)
- Out-of-bounds write when zeroing the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code execution due to the out-of-bounds write.
- The vulnerability has a high impact due to the widespread use of the Kakadu SDK, including by high-profile companies like Apple.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted JPEG 2000 file containing an unknown marker with a malicious size field is processed by the vulnerable application.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to zero out the undersized buffer leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious JPEG 2000 file to the application using the vulnerable Kakadu SDK.
- No special user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
