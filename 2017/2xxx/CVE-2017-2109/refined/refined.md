- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cybozu KUNAI for Android outputs log information when its data is synchronized with Cybozu for the first time, even if the log output function is disabled. This contradicts the expected behavior, where logging should be disabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure through unintended logging. The vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly disable logging upon initial data synchronization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious Android application, if installed by the user, could potentially access and disclose the log information generated by Cybozu KUNAI for Android. This information may contain sensitive data synchronized with Cybozu.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application installed on the same Android device as the vulnerable Cybozu KUNAI application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to install a malicious application on the same Android device. The malicious app then needs the ability to read the logs produced by the vulnerable application.
