Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied data when generating error messages within the Webmin application. Specifically, the application was not properly sanitizing or escaping HTML special characters in error messages, before outputting them on the web page. This allowed for the potential injection of malicious HTML or scripts. Additionally, the function to edit the database had similar issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)).
- Lack of proper HTML sanitization in error messages.
- Improper handling of user-supplied data in database editing functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary script execution within the user's web browser.
- This can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into fields that are later used in error messages displayed by Webmin.
- These could potentially be through various input fields, especially those related to error conditions and database interactions.
- The attacker would then rely on the vulnerable Webmin server to send these unsanitized strings to a victim's browser when certain error conditions occur.
- Successful exploitation requires the victim to interact with the vulnerable web application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into input fields or data that Webmin uses for error messages or database operations.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is triggered through web browser requests.
- The attacker requires user interaction because they need a victim to open a malicious webpage (that contains the malicious script) on a web browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a commit diff that shows how the vulnerability was fixed. The fix involved adding a function `html_strip` to remove HTML tags from potentially malicious input. This function is used in various places where error messages are generated, or other untrusted user data is output.
- The CVSS v3 score of 6.1 indicates a medium severity vulnerability.
- The CVSS v2 score of 4.3 is also indicative of medium severity.

The vulnerability is present in Webmin versions prior to 1.830.
