- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer of Yahoo! Toolbar (for Internet Explorer) has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of the DLL search path (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must place a malicious DLL file in a specific folder where the installer will search for it. The user must then run the vulnerable installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL in the correct location before the installer is run.
