Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2151:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

*   The provided content includes a description from jvn.jp that explicitly mentions **CVE-2017-2151**,  identifying a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Booking Calendar" WordPress plugin. The changelog from the plugin's website also shows a fix related to XSS vulnerability "relative date\time formats, if attacker has access to booking settings page", and "relative start day of week, if attacker has access to booking settings page"
*   Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Booking Calendar" WordPress plugin,  specifically related to user input that is not properly sanitized or escaped before being displayed on a web page. The changelog from the plugin's website shows a fix related to XSS vulnerability "relative date\time formats, if attacker has access to booking settings page", and "relative start day of week, if attacker has access to booking settings page" which would suggest these are also vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses:** The plugin is susceptible to stored XSS. This indicates a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, specifically when processing user-supplied data related to booking settings, date/time formats, and start day of the week settings.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts on the web browser of any user accessing a page generated by the vulnerable plugin. This could result in:
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   **Malware Delivery:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware into their browsers.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the affected web pages.
    *   **Account Hijacking:** In some circumstances, gaining control over a user's account if the attacker can obtain their session or login credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields or settings of the Booking Calendar plugin. This injected script will be stored in the database and then executed when other users visit pages using this Booking Calendar plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need any special access (none is required), but they require the ability to insert the malicious code via the exposed settings fields of the plugin. This usually means that the attacker needs to be authenticated to modify the booking settings, date/time formats or start day of the week of the plugin.
    *   The attacker does not require special knowledge of the server or database, simply the ability to craft malicious JavaScript payloads.

**3. Technical Details**

*   The jvn.jp description notes this is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the plugin's database or configuration and is executed when a user interacts with the affected functionality of the plugin.
*   The jvn.jp description also states that the vulnerability exists in version 7.1 and earlier.
*   The changelog provides specific fixes for the vulnerability "relative date\time formats, if attacker has access to booking settings page", and "relative start day of week, if attacker has access to booking settings page", indicating these were the exact exploitable user supplied fields.

**4. Summary of Extracted Information**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2017-2151
*   **Vulnerable Software:** WordPress plugin "Booking Calendar" version 7.1 and earlier.
*   **Root Cause:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to lack of input sanitization in booking settings, date/time formats and start day of week.
*  **Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary script execution in users' browsers, potentially leading to data theft, malware delivery, website defacement, or account hijacking.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based; malicious script injection via the plugin settings.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to the booking plugin settings or custom form fields for malicious injection. No specialized knowledge is needed beyond XSS payload construction.

This detailed analysis should provide a clear understanding of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2151, its potential impact, and the actions required to mitigate the risk.
