Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The SSH Build Agents plugin for Jenkins did not perform host key verification when establishing SSH connections to build agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Host Key Verification: The plugin failed to verify the authenticity of the remote SSH server's host key, leaving it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack: An attacker positioned between the Jenkins server and the SSH agent could intercept and modify the communication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the agent, injecting malicious code or build artifacts, or causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack occurs over the network during the SSH connection handshake between the Jenkins server and the build agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the SSH build agent. This could involve being on the same local network, or having the ability to perform network-level attacks like ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning.
- No specific Jenkins privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects SSH Build Agents Plugin versions 1.14 and earlier.
- The fix was released in version 1.15 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-161 within the Jenkins project.
- The severity of this vulnerability is classified as medium
- The plugin has been renamed to "SSH Agents Plugin" but the plugin ID remains `ssh-slaves` for compatibility.
