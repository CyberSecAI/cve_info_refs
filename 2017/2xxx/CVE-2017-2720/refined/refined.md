Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The software uses a hard-coded cryptographic key to encrypt messages between certain components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded cryptographic key:** The use of a static, hard-coded key weakens the encryption significantly. This allows attackers to potentially recover encrypted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:**  The primary impact is the increased risk of encrypted data being recovered, leading to information exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the victim's network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable system.
*   **Cryptographic knowledge:** Some understanding of cryptography might be needed to decrypt the traffic.

**Summary of the advisory:**
This document describes an information exposure vulnerability in Huawei FusionSphere OpenStack, due to the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys for encrypting communication between components. This increases the risk of information exposure. The advisory provides details on affected versions, a fix, and recommends that users contact Huawei TAC for upgrades. It also includes a CVSS score and details on how to report a security vulnerability in Huawei products.
