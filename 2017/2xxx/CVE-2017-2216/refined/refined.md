Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2216:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user inputs within the "WordPress Download Manager" plugin, specifically in the `tpls/wpdm-login-form.php` and `tpls/wpdm-reg-form.php` files, allowing for injection of malicious scripts via the `redirect_to` parameter within the login and registration forms, and the `permalink` parameter in the registration form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input that is later used to generate HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into pages generated by the plugin. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious script in the `redirect_to` GET parameter of the login form, or the `permalink` parameter of the registration form. An attacker needs to entice a user to click this specially crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any special privileges or access other than the ability to create a link. The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to visit a crafted URL. This could be done via email, social media, or other forms of communication.

**Additional notes:**
The fix included in version 2.9.50 of the plugin uses `esc_attr(esc_url())` to sanitize the `redirect_to` parameter in the login form and the `permalink` parameter in the registration form. This escaping prevents the execution of malicious scripts within these parameters. The JVN report also notes the CVSS v3 base score as 6.1, which provides further context on the severity.
