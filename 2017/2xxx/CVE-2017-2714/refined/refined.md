- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GaussDB has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of input validation on some parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer Overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition in the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker on the LAN could access the GaussDB.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and have access to the GaussDB on the LAN.
