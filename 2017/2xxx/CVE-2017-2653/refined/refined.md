Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of unused delete routes in the CloudForms application that could be accessed via GET requests instead of the intended POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect HTTP Method Handling:** The application incorrectly allows certain actions, intended for POST requests, to be triggered by GET requests.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Bypass:** By allowing GET requests for sensitive actions, the application fails to check the `protect_from_forgery` token, thus bypassing CSRF protection mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially bypass CSRF protection and execute unintended actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or similar attack where the attacker crafts a malicious link or injects code to perform the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to inject malicious code or links that would trigger the vulnerable GET requests. This could be achieved through XSS or other means.
- The attacker must also be able to lure a user into accessing the malicious link or page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine and was addressed in version 5.7.2.1.
- The issue was classified as having a "Moderate" security impact by Red Hat.
- The fix involves ensuring that the vulnerable delete routes are only accessible through POST requests, enforcing CSRF protection.
- The advisory RHSA-2017:0898 addresses this vulnerability along with other bugs and enhancements.
