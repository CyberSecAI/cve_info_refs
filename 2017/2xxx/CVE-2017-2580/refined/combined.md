| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1024291#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2017-02-08 14:34:46 UTC  ``` This OOBW issues occurs in giftopnm and causes by a improper deal with a zero-size heap chunk allocation and when malloc() is called it will be crash by unlink this heap overflow.  This issue can be caused by a malformed GIF file through giftopnm. Attackers could exploit this issue to result in DoS and might cause arbitrary code execution by using some feature of unlink() to arbitrary anywhere.

So maybe we need to wait until March.  The good news is that none of our codestreams contains the function addPixelToRaster(). So we can consider this doesn't affect us.  Maybe we should wait about getting more details about the issue before closing the ticket, though. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1024291#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2017-02-08 23:02:40 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1024291#c3)  Petr Gajdos   2017-02-28 14:15:49 UTC  ``` Potential fix: <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/netpbm.git/commit/?id=c16a8b893ed77fc3f6f2b382d0d47d03621ed328> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1024291#c4)  Petr Gajdos   2017-02-28 14:16:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Petr Gajdos from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1024291#c3)) > Potential fix: > <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/netpbm.git/commit/> > ?id=c16a8b893ed77fc3f6f2b382d0d47d03621ed328  Err, wrong tab.

This issue can be caused by a malformed GIF file through giftopnm. Attackers could exploit this issue to result in DoS and might cause arbitrary code execution.

There was some "cleanup" on the trunk in giftopnm.c around expandCodeOntoStack() but I couldn't find any obvious security fixes.  So maybe we need to wait until March. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1024288#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2017-02-08 23:02:28 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1024288#c4)  Petr Gajdos   2017-02-28 14:06:26 UTC  ``` No news in <https://sourceforge.net/p/netpbm/code/2905/log/?path=/trunk/converter/other/giftopnm.c> ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1024288#c5)  Petr Gajdos   2017-06-06 09:07:06 UTC  ``` I have not found any other information than 'there is a bug in giftopnm.c in expandCodeOntoStack()' as stated in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1024288#c0).

This doesn't even work out of the box. It seems libtool discards the switch during linking (a libtool bug, it whitelists linker switches).
