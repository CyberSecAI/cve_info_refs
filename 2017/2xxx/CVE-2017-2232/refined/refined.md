- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer for Shinseiyou Sougou Soft has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a specific folder that the installer searches, and when the installer is run, it will load and execute the malicious DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into placing the malicious DLL in a location where the installer will search for DLLs. The attacker does not need any privileges to do so. The user must then run the installer.
