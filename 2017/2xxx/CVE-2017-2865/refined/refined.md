- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Circle with Disney device fetches firmware updates over plain HTTP using `wget`, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. The device fetches both the firmware version information and the update script over HTTP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of encryption or integrity checks when fetching firmware updates, allowing for modification during transit.
    - Command injection via a malicious shell script.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with root privileges on the Circle with Disney device.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack. Specifically, ARP poisoning is mentioned as an easy vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the Circle with Disney device to intercept and alter network traffic, as well as perform ARP poisoning on the network where the device operates.
