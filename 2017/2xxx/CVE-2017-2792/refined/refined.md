- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the `iBldDirInfo` function of AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter. This occurs due to incorrect handling of string conversions from Unicode to SJIS when parsing Compound File Directory Entries within an XLS file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow, specifically an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which leads to heap corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. The heap corruption leads to a crash, but the vulnerability is classified as exploitable, meaning it can be leveraged for code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted malicious XLS file provided as input to the vulnerable converter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XLS file to the system using the vulnerable AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter. This is typically done when the system processes files uploaded by users. The vulnerable component is used by MarkLogic for XLS document conversion as part of their web based document search and rendering engine.
