Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the FlashAir's PhotoShare function not setting proper credentials when enabled through a web browser. When enabled via the web browser, it uses default credentials for the secondary wireless network instead of prompting the user to set their own.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper credential setting for the PhotoShare function when accessed through a web browser. It defaults to using the preconfigured credentials for other wireless networks.
*   **Use of Default Credentials:** The system falls back to default credentials, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The JVN description explicitly refers to this CWE, indicating that the flaw lies in the lack of proper restrictions on who can access the shared data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Data:** A remote attacker within the range of the FlashAir's wireless network can gain access to image data stored on the device by using the default credentials, leading to a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network (Wireless LAN):** The attacker must be within the range of the wireless network created by the FlashAir device.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by exploiting the PhotoShare function through a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within the wireless range of the FlashAir device when PhotoShare is enabled via web browser.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default credentials that are configured for other wireless networks of the FlashAir device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when enabling the PhotoShare function via a web browser, and not through the mobile application, which prompts for the credentials
*   The vulnerability is specific to certain versions of FlashAir SDHC Memory Cards:
    *   FlashAirTM SDHC Memory Card (SD-WE Series <W-03>) V3.00.01 and earlier
    *   FlashAirTM SDHC Memory Card (SD-WD/WC Series <W-02>) V2.00.03 and earlier
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by using the mobile application to set the credentials for the PhotoShare function.
*   The vendor has released firmware updates that disable PhotoShare setting from web browsers.
    *   FlashAirTM SDHC Memory Card (SD-WE Series <W-03>) V3.00.02
    *   FlashAirTM SDHC Memory Card (SD-WD/WC Series <W-02>) V2.00.04

This detailed analysis highlights how the lack of proper access control, specifically when using the web browser interface, creates a vulnerability that attackers can exploit.
