- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing error check in the `sub_2C878` function, which handles the retrieval of the `authResetKey`. This function does not return an error code when the key is not set, allowing the subsequent comparison to succeed even when no valid key is present.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing error check, Improper Input Validation. The lack of error handling in `sub_2C878` allows the password reset process to continue with an empty key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reset the user accounts to factory defaults without authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the device on port 10001 with the command 0x0064 and a null byte as key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the device on port 10001. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.
