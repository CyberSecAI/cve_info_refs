Package        : sqlite3
Version        : 3.8.7.1-1+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-2518 CVE-2017-2519 CVE-2017-2520
                 CVE-2017-10989 CVE-2018-8740
Debian Bug     : 867618 893195

Several flaws were corrected in SQLite, an SQL database engine.

CVE-2017-2518

    A use-after-free bug in the query optimizer may cause a
    buffer overflow and application crash via a crafted SQL statement.

CVE-2017-2519

    Insufficient size of the reference count on Table objects
    could lead to a denial-of-service or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2017-2520

    The sqlite3_value_text() interface returned a buffer that was not
    large enough to hold the complete string plus zero terminator when
    the input was a zeroblob. This could lead to arbitrary code
    execution or a denial-of-service.

CVE-2017-10989

    SQLite mishandles undersized RTree blobs in a crafted database
    leading to a heap-based buffer over-read or possibly unspecified
    other impact.

CVE-2018-8740

    Databases whose schema is corrupted using a CREATE TABLE AS
    statement could cause a NULL pointer dereference.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.8.7.1-1+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
