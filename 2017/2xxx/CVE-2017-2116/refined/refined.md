Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2017-2116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **access restriction flaw** in the "customapp" feature of Cybozu Office. Specifically, it affects the **template deletion functionality.**

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** - The vulnerability stems from inadequate access controls that allow unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker, if logged in, can delete "customapp" templates belonging to other logged-in users. This can lead to **data loss** or **disruption of service** for affected users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network** - The attack is performed remotely over a network.
*   **Authentication Required**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user.
*   **No User Interaction**: The attack does not require any user interaction besides the attacker's actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a **logged-in user** of the Cybozu Office system. This indicates a privilege escalation or horizontal movement scenario, where a user with some access can perform actions they should not have permissions for.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls in the customapp template deletion feature, allowing a logged-in user to delete templates they should not have access to, leading to potential data loss and disruption of service.
