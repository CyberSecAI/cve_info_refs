Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2447:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the WebKit JavaScript engine when handling bound function arguments.
- When `Function.bind()` is used, the provided arguments are copied into an array. This array's prototype can be modified using user-defined code to alter its length, making it longer than its underlying native butterfly array.
- During the `boundFunctionCall`, WebKit doesn't validate the array length and attempts to copy the arguments from the modified array assuming the length is still within the allocated bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** Reading memory outside the allocated buffer.
- **Lack of bounds checking:** The code doesn't validate the array length before copying the arguments.
- **Prototype pollution:** The ability to modify an Array's prototype allows user-controlled code to impact internal WebKit operations.
- **Type confusion:** The read values are treated as `JSValues`, which can be manipulated to cause type confusion if the attacker controls the out-of-bounds memory being read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** By controlling the out-of-bounds memory being read, an attacker could cause type confusion, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Information disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive memory data.
- **Denial of service:**  The provided proof of concept shows that a crash can occur when the out-of-bounds read happens, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Compromise of user information:** Visiting a malicious website may compromise user information as a result of the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Website:** A specially crafted website containing malicious JavaScript code that exploits the `Function.bind()` issue.
- **User interaction:** The victim would need to visit this malicious website, allowing the javascript code to execute in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can execute the exploit by hosting a malicious website or embedding the exploit in an advertisement.
- **Ability to craft JavaScript:** The attacker must have the ability to craft JavaScript code to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges on the user's machine to perform the attack.

**Additional Information:**

- The exploit was initially found in WebKit trunk and Safari preview and was later patched in regular Safari releases.
- The vulnerability is present in iOS, tvOS, and macOS, and corresponding patches were released.
- The exploit code provided in the exploit-db report further illustrates how the length of an Array's prototype can be altered to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

The provided information gives a good understanding of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and its potential impact. This also has more information than the CVE description which is just a placeholder.
