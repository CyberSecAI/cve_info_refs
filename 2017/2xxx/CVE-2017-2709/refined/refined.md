- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of adequate input validation in certain Huawei applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The applications fail to properly validate incoming data, specifically malformed packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the affected applications.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious application, which then sends malformed packets to the targeted Huawei application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application on their device. The attacker also needs to be able to send malformed packets to the device.
