The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2213.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The installers for "SemiDynaEXE" and other software from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) have an issue with their DLL search path. This allows for the insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack vector (requires the attacker to place a malicious DLL in a specific location)
- User interaction is required - the user must run the vulnerable installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder before the installer is run by the user.
- The attacker needs to trick the user to run the vulnerable installer.
