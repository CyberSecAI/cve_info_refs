- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `xls_addCell` function of libxls when parsing a MULBLANK record in an XLS file. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper bounds checking when calculating the index of cells within a row during MULBLANK record parsing. Specifically, the code calculates cell indices based on values directly taken from the file without validating if they exceed the allocated size for the row, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Out-of-bounds write: The code writes data to memory locations outside the allocated buffer for cells in a row.
    - Lack of input validation: The code does not validate the `row` and `col` values obtained from the file, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary values that could lead to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to heap corruption and potentially remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious XLS file containing a specifically crafted MULBLANK record.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver or have a user open the malicious XLS file. This could be achieved through email, web downloads, or other file-sharing methods.
