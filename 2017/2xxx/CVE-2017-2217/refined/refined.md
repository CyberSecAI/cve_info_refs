Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input in the `redirect_to` parameter within the WordPress Download Manager plugin, specifically in the login form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect (CWE-601):** The plugin fails to properly validate and sanitize the `redirect_to` parameter used in the login form, allowing an attacker to inject an arbitrary URL that will redirect the user after a successful login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection to Arbitrary Website:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing a harmful value in the `redirect_to` parameter. If a user clicks this manipulated link and then logs into the affected WordPress site, the user will be redirected to a website controlled by the attacker. This could be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** An attacker creates a specially crafted URL with a malicious `redirect_to` parameter and tricks a user into clicking it. This could be achieved through social engineering, email campaigns, or by posting it on forums or websites.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires a user to interact with the crafted link and then log in to the targeted website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs to create and distribute a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it and subsequently logging in.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

-   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.9.51 of the WordPress Download Manager plugin.
-   The JVN report provides CVSS v3 and v2 scores, along with a CWE identifier.
-   The vulnerability was reported by Gen Sato of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
-   The patch was included in changeset 1650075 which fixed the issue with the signup page and page template dropdown, and changeset 1661953 which further sanitized input for redirects.
- The vulnerable code is located within `tpls/wpdm-login-form.php` where the `redirect_to` parameter from `$_GET` was not properly sanitized using `esc_url` before use. The fix utilizes `esc_attr(esc_url($_GET['redirect_to']))` to sanitize the URL. Additionally, there is another instance where the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` was used without sanitization. This has also been addressed by applying `esc_attr`.
