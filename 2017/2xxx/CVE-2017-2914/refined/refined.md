The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2017-2914.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper authentication mechanism in the `apid` binary of the Circle with Disney device. The `apid` server uses a token-based authentication scheme where the provided token is compared against entries in the `/mnt/shares/usr/bin/app_list` file. Due to how `strstr` function works, any substring match within a line in `app_list` file would bypass the authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Authentication:** The authentication logic relies on a simple substring match (`strstr`) instead of a full token comparison.
- **Information Leakage:** The `appid` used in token generation is leaked in the client SSL certificate during connection of admin’s phone to the remote Circle device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unintended administrative access to the Circle with Disney device. This grants the attacker full control over the device's configurations and functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Circle device.
- **Token manipulation:** The attacker must craft a malicious token containing a substring of a line from `/mnt/shares/usr/bin/app_list` file,specifically the appid string with " 8CE" appended to it, to bypass authentication.
- **Passive information gathering:** The attacker can obtain the `appid` by intercepting the SSL connection between the administrator’s phone and the Circle device (over remote.meetcircle.co) via client SSL certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Circle with Disney device.
- The attacker needs to intercept the SSL connection between administrator’s phone and the remote Circle device to obtain the appid.
