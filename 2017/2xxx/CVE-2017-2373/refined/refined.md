Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Type confusion in the `RenderBox::firstChildBox()` function when accessibility is enabled, leading to a bad cast. The function expects a `RenderBox` type child, but receives a `RenderText` type instead.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Type confusion: The code attempts to downcast a `RenderText` object to a `RenderBox`, leading to out-of-bounds access.
- Improper type checking: The `firstChildBox()` function does not properly validate the type of the first child before downcasting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The type confusion and subsequent memory access violation causes the application (WebKit) to crash.
- Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution: While the provided exploit demonstrates DoS, the underlying memory corruption can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing maliciously crafted web content: The vulnerability is triggered by loading and rendering a web page with specific crafted HTML/JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to serve or trick a user into loading a malicious web page.
- The vulnerability is triggered when accessibility features are enabled. This is enabled by default in WebKitGTK+, and may also be triggered by having the Web Inspector/Error Console enabled in Safari.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability by manipulating the DOM of a webpage using a `<menu>` and `<details>` elements.
- The proof-of-concept code causes a global-buffer-overflow due to the incorrect type casting.
- The vulnerability was tested on WebKitGTK+ 2.14.2, and also crashes Safari.
- This vulnerability affects multiple platforms, including tvOS, iOS, macOS.
- The fix involves improvements to memory handling.
