Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WN-AC1167GR wireless LAN router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79). This means that malicious script can be injected and stored within the router's system, and it will be executed when other users access the relevant parts of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
If a user accesses a crafted URL while logged into the router's management interface, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    * Cookie theft: Stealing session cookies to impersonate the user.
    * Session hijacking: Taking control of the user's session.
    * Defacement: Altering the visual appearance of the web page.
    * Phishing attacks: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    * Unauthorized actions: Performing actions on the router on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious URL. The attacker must craft a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code and trick a logged-in administrator into accessing that URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious Javascript code
*   The attacker needs to persuade a logged-in administrator of the vulnerable device to click on the malicious URL
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the web interface of the device
