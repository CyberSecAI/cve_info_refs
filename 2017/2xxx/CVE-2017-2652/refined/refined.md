- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing permission checks in the Distributed Fork plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Distributed Fork plugin lacks proper permission checks for the `dist-fork` CLI command. It only verifies if a user has Overall/Read permission, which is insufficient.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with Overall/Read permission can execute arbitrary shell commands on all connected nodes.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `dist-fork` CLI command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission within Jenkins.
