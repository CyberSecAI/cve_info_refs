Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-2921

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow during websocket packet processing. Specifically, the `data_len` is read from the packet, and added to the header length to calculate the total frame length. A large `data_len` can cause an integer wraparound, resulting in a small `frame_len`, bypassing the size check. The code then uses the original large `data_len` to copy bytes, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** Occurs when calculating `frame_len` by adding `header_len` to a large `data_len` value.
*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** Due to the integer overflow, the code uses the large `data_len` to perform a loop that writes past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap overflow causes a process crash.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The heap overflow could be leveraged to overwrite critical data on the heap, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Network:** An attacker sends a specially crafted websocket packet to a vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious websocket packet with a large `data_len` to trigger the integer overflow.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs in the `mg_deliver_websocket_data` function of the Cesanta Mongoose library.
*   The vulnerable code performs an insufficient check `frame_len <= buf_len` after a potential integer overflow in the `frame_len` calculation.
*   The `data_len` is directly read from 8 bytes within the websocket packet, and is not checked against reasonable bounds.
*   The code attempts to XOR the buffer with a mask based on the `data_len`.
*   The provided exploit proof of concept demonstrates sending a crafted websocket packet with a very large payload length to trigger the vulnerability.
