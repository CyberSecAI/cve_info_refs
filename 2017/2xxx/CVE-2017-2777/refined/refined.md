The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2017-2777.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `ipStringCreate` function when allocating memory for a string object. Specifically, if the provided `size` argument to this function is larger than `0xfffffff4`, adding 11 to the size will result in an integer overflow causing the allocation of a much smaller buffer than intended. Later, when the contents of `buffPtr` are copied into the allocated buffer using `memmove`, a heap overflow occurs due to writing past the end of the undersized buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow in the calculation of the allocation size in `ipStringCreate`.
- Heap overflow when copying data into the undersized buffer.
- Missing error check for the return value of `ipDataFeedRead`, which can lead to passing a very large value to `ipStringCreate`

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability allows for remote code execution. By sending a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker can trigger a heap overflow, corrupting memory and potentially gaining control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted PDF file to the vulnerable application. The application uses the vulnerable `ipStringCreate` function to handle data within the PDF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious PDF file to the application. No specific user privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via a network or by opening the crafted PDF file locally with the vulnerable application.
