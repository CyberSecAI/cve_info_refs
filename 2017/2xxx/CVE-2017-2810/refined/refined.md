Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of the unsafe `yaml.load` function in the `tablib/formats/_yaml.py` module when loading a YAML stream into a Databook. This function is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through the inclusion of python directives within the YAML data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The primary weakness is the use of `yaml.load`, which deserializes YAML data without proper sanitization, allowing for the execution of arbitrary Python code embedded within the YAML.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the input stream.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary Python commands with the privileges of the process running the Tablib library. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system if the application is running with elevated permissions.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can also use this to manipulate data or potentially access sensitive information depending on the context of how tablib is used.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious YAML File:** The attacker crafts a malicious YAML file containing Python directives that specify commands to be executed.
*   **Entice User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user or system to process the crafted YAML file using Tablib's Databook loading functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Deliver Malicious YAML:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious YAML data to the system. This could be through user interaction, file uploads, or any other way the system is designed to receive YAML files for processing via tablib.
*   **User Interaction or System Automation:** Either a user must be tricked to load the malicious YAML, or an automated process must load the malicious YAML stream using Tablib.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of Tablib prior to 0.12.1.
*   The suggested mitigation is to replace `yaml.load` with `yaml.safe_load`.
*   This vulnerability affects the `dev-python/tablib` package on Gentoo.
