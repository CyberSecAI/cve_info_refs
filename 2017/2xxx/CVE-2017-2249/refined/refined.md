The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2249.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Self-extracting archive files created by Lhaz+ insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries. This is due to the application's failure to properly validate the location from which DLLs are loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to insecure DLL loading (CWE-427).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who invokes the self-extracting archive file.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious actor can craft a self-extracting archive file containing a malicious DLL. When the user runs this archive, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious self-extracting archive file to a victim and convince them to execute it.
