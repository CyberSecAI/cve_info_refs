  "CVE-2017-2633": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds memory access issue was found in QEMU's VNC display driver support. The vulnerability could occur while refreshing the VNC display surface area in the 'vnc_refresh_server_surface'. A user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds memory access while refreshing the VNC display surface area.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "A user inside a guest can crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A VNC client attempts to update its display after a VGA operation is performed by a guest, triggering the vulnerability during VNC refresh."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Privileged user/process inside a guest."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs specifically in the 'vnc_refresh_server_surface' function when the VNC display is being refreshed. This can be triggered when a VNC client requests a display update after a VGA operation by a guest. The out-of-bounds read is due to an unchecked resolution limit, leading to memory corruption."
