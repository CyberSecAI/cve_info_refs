[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1206)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM.

Security Fix(es):

* A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator's VNC display driver support; the issue could occur when a VNC client attempted to update its display after a VGA operation is performed by a guest. A privileged user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2016-9603)
* An out-of-bounds r/w access issue was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support. The vulnerability could occur while copying VGA data via various bitblt functions. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-7980)
* An out-of-bounds memory access issue was found in QEMU's VNC display driver support. The vulnerability could occur while refreshing the VNC display surface area in the 'vnc\_refresh\_server\_surface'. A user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-2633)
* An out-of-bounds access issue was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support. The vulnerability could occur while copying VGA data using bitblt functions (for example, cirrus\_bitblt\_rop\_fwd\_transp\_). A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-7718)

Red Hat would like to thank Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) and Li Qiang (Qihoo 360 Gear Team) for reporting CVE-2017-7980 and Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-7718.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM.

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds memory access issue was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in the VNC display driver. This flaw could occur while refreshing the VNC display surface area in the 'vnc\_refresh\_server\_surface'. A user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-2633)
* An integer overflow flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in the CCID Card device support. The flaw could occur while passing messages via command/response packets to and from the host. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-5898)
* An information exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)

Red Hat would like to thank Li Qiang (360.cn Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-5898 and Donghai Zdh (Alibaba Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-4020.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for RHEV 3.X Hypervisor and Agents for RHEL-6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

Security Fix(es):

* A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator's VNC display driver support; the issue could occur when a VNC client attempted to update its display after a VGA operation is performed by a guest. A privileged user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2016-9603)
* Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds r/w access issue. The vulnerability could occur while copying VGA data via various bitblt functions. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code on a host with privileges of the host's QEMU process. (CVE-2017-7980)
* Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with the VNC display driver support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds memory access issue. The vulnerability could occur while refreshing the VNC display surface area in the 'vnc\_refresh\_server\_surface'. A user/process inside the guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a DoS. (CVE-2017-2633)
* Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. The vulnerability could occur while copying VGA data using bitblt functions (for example, cirrus\_bitblt\_rop\_fwd\_transp\_). A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in DoS. (CVE-2017-7718)

Red Hat would like to thank Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) Li Qiang (Qihoo 360 Gear Team) for reporting CVE-2017-7980 and Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-7718.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1430056#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2017-03-07 19:02:52 UTC  ``` Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator and the VNC display driver support is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow issue. It could occur when Vnc client attempts to update its display after a vga operation is performed by a guest.  A privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS  OR  potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the Qemu process.

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

Security Fix(es):

* A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator's VNC display driver support; the issue could occur when a VNC client attempted to update its display after a VGA operation is performed by a guest. A privileged user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2016-9603)
* An out-of-bounds r/w access issue was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support. The vulnerability could occur while copying VGA data via various bitblt functions. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-7980)
* An out-of-bounds memory access issue was found in QEMU's VNC display driver support. The vulnerability could occur while refreshing the VNC display surface area in the 'vnc\_refresh\_server\_surface'. A user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-2633)
* An out-of-bounds access issue was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support. The vulnerability could occur while copying VGA data using bitblt functions (for example, cirrus\_bitblt\_rop\_fwd\_transp\_). A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-7718)

Red Hat would like to thank Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) and Li Qiang (Qihoo 360 Gear Team) for reporting CVE-2017-7980 and Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-7718.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

The issue also can be reproduced on rhel7.3z with below packages: qemu-kvm-1.5.3-126.el7_3.5 kernel-3.10.0-514.10.2.el7  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): qemu-kvm-1.5.3-132.el7 kernel-3.10.0-576.el7  How reproducible: 2/2  Steps to Reproduce: 1.#brew download-build --rpm qemu-kvm-1.5.3-132.el7.src.rpm 2.#rpm -ivhf qemu-kvm-1.5.3-132.el7.src.rpm && rpmbuild -bp /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/qemu-kvm.spec --nodeps --force 3.#cd /root/rpmbuild/BUILD/qemu-1.5.3/tests/qemu-iotests 4.#export QEMU_PROG=/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm 5.#./check -qcow2  Actual results:   Expected results: All case passed except not run  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c2)  Ping Li    2017-02-27 14:18:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1258110](attachment.cgi?id=1258110 "log for qcow2 test on rhel7.4") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1258110&action=edit "log for qcow2 test on rhel7.4") log for qcow2 test on rhel7.4   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c3)  Hanna Czenczek    2017-03-08 20:31:22 UTC  ``` Hi,  The test results posted in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c2) don't seem to match the result from the original description (different tests are failing). Also, I am not sure which tests you are running exactly. Are those the upstream tests or the ones that are in RHEL's downstream qemu-kvm repository?  I'm asking because so far I only see 026 and 030 failing and I cannot see test 095 downstream.  Also, you have to make sure that not only QEMU_PROG is set but also QEMU_IMG_PROG (to qemu-img), QEMU_IO_PROG (to qemu-io), and QEMU_NBD_PROG (to qemu-nbd). The log from [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c2) looks like it's using the standard system versions of qemu-img and qemu-io there, and I'm not sure whether those are in the same version as the qemu you are trying to test.   Max   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c7)  Ping Li    2017-03-11 04:33:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1262105](attachment.cgi?id=1262105 "log for qcow2 test on rhel7.4 after applied patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1262105&action=edit "log for qcow2 test on rhel7.4 after applied patch") log for qcow2 test on rhel7.4 after applied patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c8)  Ping Li    2017-03-11 04:34:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1262106](attachment.cgi?id=1262106 "log for vmdk test on rhel7.4 after applied patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1262106&action=edit "log for vmdk test on rhel7.4 after applied patch") log for vmdk test on rhel7.4 after applied patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c9)  Ping Li    2017-03-11 04:34:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1262107](attachment.cgi?id=1262107 "log for vhdx test on rhel7.4 after applied patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1262107&action=edit "log for vhdx test on rhel7.4 after applied patch") log for vhdx test on rhel7.4 after applied patch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c10)  Hanna Czenczek    2017-03-13 00:56:20 UTC  ``` Thanks! Now I'm able to reproduce all of the qcow2 failures and working on fixing them.  Most of the vmdk and vhdx failures however are due to missing test images. Those are present in the git repository, just not in the source RPM. Since vmdk and vhdx are not exactly vital, I'd say that if you want to test them anyway you would have to use the git repository instead of the SRPM as the basis for testing.  If that does not fit into the test cycle very well, I think it would be fine to just omit vmdk and vhdx from testing (or anything that is not qcow2 or raw for that matter).  Max   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c11)  Kevin Wolf    2017-03-14 16:21:39 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1170963](show_bug.cgi?id=1170963 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - test case 025 026 030 040 041 and 067 of qemu-iotests fail for qcow2 with qemu-kvm-1.5.3-83.el7.x86_64") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c12)  Hanna Czenczek    2017-03-16 00:26:33 UTC  ``` Stefan made me reconsider my opinion from [comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c10) that we could just omit vmdk and vhdx from testing. So if you need to run the tests from the SRPM and cannot run them from the git repository (or at least pull the test images from the repository), we will have to put the sample images into the SRPM as well.  So, would it be possible for you to run the tests from the repository instead of from the SRPM?  Max   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c14)  Miroslav Rezanina    2017-03-21 14:20:49 UTC  ``` Fix included in qemu-kvm-1.5.3-134.el7   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c17)  Ping Li    2017-03-23 07:29:57 UTC  ``` Verify the issue with below packages and steps, all the cases for qcow2, raw, vhdx and vmdk are passed when run the test suit from the repository.  package version: qemu-kvm-1.5.3-134.el7 kernel-3.10.0-619.el7  steps: 1. #git clone git://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/virt/rhel7/qemu-kvm.git 2. #cd /home/qemu-kvm 3. #git checkout qemu-kvm-1.5.3-134.el7 4. #cd tests/qemu-iotests 5. #export QEMU_PROG=/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm 6. #./check -qcow2(raw/vhdx/vmdk)  test results: qcow2: Passed all 69 tests raw: Passed all 20 tests vhdx: Passed all 17 tests vmdk: Passed all 26 tests   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c18)  Ping Li    2017-03-23 07:41:34 UTC  ``` Hi Max,  Could you help to check the [comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c13)? Thanks in advance.  When ran the test suit from SRPM, the failure can still be reproduced. vhdx: Failures: 064 070 vmdk: Failures: 059   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c19)  Hanna Czenczek    2017-03-27 14:16:56 UTC  ``` Hi pingl,  Yes, as I wrote, those fail because the required sample images are missing from the SRPM. Miroslav Rezanina has told me that this will be no longer be an issue in 7.5, but for 7.4 we would require a specific fix (and just for 7.4).  So I'm not sure how to continue with this bug. From my point of view the most important fixes are merged now. Maybe Miroslav will write a patch to include the sample images in the SRPM; or I guess we can just keep the bug open until 7.5 but I'm not sure whether our process likes a bug that is neither NEW/ASSIGNED nor CLOSED to move from one release to another.  I have asked Miroslav to write such a patch if he thinks it's worth the effort so that we don't have to move this BZ to 7.5.

I opened a new [bug 1436280](show_bug.cgi?id=1436280 "CLOSED ERRATA - sample images for qemu-iotests are missing in the SRPM") to track the missing sample images, then we can set this bug as verified according to the [comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c17). Thanks again for your help.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1427176#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-01 17:46:48 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Subject: CVE-2017-2633 Qemu: VNC: memory corruption due to unchecked resolution
 limit

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VNC display driver support is vulnerable
to an out-of-bounds memory access issue. It could occur while refreshing the
vnc display surface area in 'vnc_refresh_server_surface'.

A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <http://git.qemu-project.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=bea60dd7679364493a0d7f5b54316c767cf894ef>
   -> <http://git.qemu-project.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=9f64916da20eea67121d544698676295bbb105a7>

Older versions of Qemu are affected, latest upstream releases are not.

'CVE-2017-2633' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
