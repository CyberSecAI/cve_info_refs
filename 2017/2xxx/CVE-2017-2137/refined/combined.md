# JVN#08740778 NETGEAR ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility vulnerable to improper access control

## Overview

ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility is vulnerable to improper access control.

## Products Affected

* ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility prior to 2.3.29

## Description

ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility provided by NETGEAR is a Windows application to configure and manage NETGEAR's ProSAFE Plus and Click Switches. An operator uses the utility to login and configure NETGEAR switches.

When the utility is invoked, it starts listening on a certain port for SOAP requests. The utility executes configuration tasks for switches according to the SOAP requests.

The utility accepts connections from network, hence unintended operation may be conducted on the switches through the utility ([CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)).

## Impact

The Configuration Utility may be manipulated by some unexpected SOAP requests to configure the connected switch.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

NETGEAR is aware of a security issue in the ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility that allows an unauthenticated user to change settings on NETGEAR switches that the ProSAFE Plus Utility can configure. This insecure Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) access vulnerability can only be exploited from a computer on the local network and must be exploited while the utility is running.

This vulnerability is present in the following utility versions:

* ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility versions earlier than 2.3.29

This vulnerability affects all products that can be configured with the ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility:

* FS116E
* GS105E
* GS105Ev2
* GS105PE
* GS108Ev1
* GS108Ev2
* GS108Ev3
* GS108PEv1
* GS108PEv2
* GS108PEv3
* GS116E
* GS116Ev2
* GS408EPP
* GSS108E
* GSS108EPP
* GSS116E
* JFS524E
* JGS516PE
* JGS524E
* JGS524Ev2
* JGS524PE
* XS708E
* XS708Ev2
* XS716E

NETGEAR has released an update to the ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility that fixes the insecure SOAP access vulnerability. ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility versions 2.3.29 and later are not affected by this vulnerability.

NETGEAR recommends that all users upgrade to the latest version of the ProSAFE Plus Utility as soon as possible.

**To download the latest version of the ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility:**

1. Visit the [NETGEAR Download Center](http://downloadcenter.netgear.com/).
2. Under **Search for**, select the check box next to **Firmware/Software**.
3. Enter **ProSAFE Plus Utility** in the search box and click the magnifying glass.
4. Select **ProSAFE Plus Utility** from the drop-down menu.
5. Click the most recent version, which is the one closest to the top of the list.

   The download starts as soon as you select a destination for the download.
6. (Optional) To view the release notes for this utility version, click **Release Notes**.
7. Unzip the new utility version to an easy-to-find location, such as your desktop.
8. Double-click the new utility version and click **Yes** to confirm that you want to upgrade to the new version of the utility.
9. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the latest version of the ProSAFE Plus Utility.

The potential for insecure SOAP access remains if you do not complete all recommended steps. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by upgrading to the latest version of the ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility as recommended in this notification.
