{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-2585",
  "description": "It was found that keycloak's implementation of HMAC verification for JWS tokens uses a method that runs in non-constant time, potentially leaving the application vulnerable to timing attacks.",
  "technical_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the non-constant time comparison used in the HMAC verification of JWS tokens within Keycloak.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Timing Attack"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information or bypass security mechanisms through timing analysis.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks exploiting the time taken for HMAC verification."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the capability to send crafted JWS tokens and observe the timing variations in the server's responses.",
    "affected_components": [
        "Keycloak"
      ]
  },
  "remediation": "The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later.",
