Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-2379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability existed in the handling of font files within the Carbon component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a buffer overflow. This occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer's boundary. In this case, it's triggered when processing a maliciously crafted `.dfont` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to run malicious code on the vulnerable device, potentially gaining full control.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves processing a maliciously crafted `.dfont` file. This could be achieved via various means, such as tricking a user into opening the file or through a web browser loading the font file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the capability to deliver a malicious `.dfont` file to the target system and have the system attempt to process it using the vulnerable Carbon component. The attacker could be local or remote, depending on the method of delivery.

**Affected Systems:**
The vulnerability affects tvOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.3,  iOS 10.3, and watchOS 3.2

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by improved bounds checking, which prevents the buffer overflow by ensuring data doesn't exceed buffer limits.
- The vulnerability was discovered by John Villamil, Doyensec, and riusksk (泉哥) of Tencent Security Platform Department.
