Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a type confusion issue within the WebKit component, specifically related to how `constructJSReadableStreamDefaultReader` function handles objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `constructJSReadableStreamDefaultReader` function in WebKit does not properly check if the `getReader` property of a ReadableStream object is callable before calling it. This allows an attacker to replace `getReader` with an arbitrary non-callable value (e.g. a number), leading to type confusion.
- The lack of type checking allows the execution of non-function objects as a function leading to unexpected behavior and memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content. Specifically, crafting a webpage with a `ReadableStream` object where the `getReader` property is overwritten with a non-callable value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve or deliver malicious web content to a user. This can be achieved through a malicious website, or by injecting the malicious content into a trusted site.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge about the internal workings of WebKit's `ReadableStream` implementation and how the `constructJSReadableStreamDefaultReader` function operates.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit detailed in Exploit-DB shows how to exploit this vulnerability using Javascript by creating a `ReadableStream` and overwriting its `getReader` property with a number. Then, a new object of the constructor of the original `getReader` is created using the modified `ReadableStream`. This triggers the type confusion in the `constructJSReadableStreamDefaultReader` function.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Safari 10.1 and iOS 10.3 by improving memory handling, which suggests that the fix involved adding the missing type checks.
- It is noted in the Apple security advisories that this vulnerability was discovered by lokihardt of Google Project Zero.
