RELATED:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The hammer_cli command-line client, a utility for Foreman, did not explicitly set the `verify_ssl` flag for apipie-bindings, which disables SSL/TLS certificate verification by default.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Missing SSL/TLS certificate verification, which makes connections prone to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
  - Impact of exploitation: A MITM attacker can intercept and potentially modify communication between the `hammer_cli` client and the API server by spoofing a valid certificate.
  - Attack vectors: MITM attack.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be positioned in the network to intercept traffic between the `hammer_cli` client and the API server. The attacker also requires the ability to spoof a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
