Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs due to improper validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it within the XFA field font size handling in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when an application attempts to use memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
- Improper input validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the currently running process. This could allow the attacker to take control of the affected system, depending on the application's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote and requires user interaction.
-  An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by either:
    -  luring a victim to visit a malicious webpage containing a crafted XFA field.
    - persuading the victim to open a malicious PDF file with a crafted XFA field

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious XFA fields.
- The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious file or link to the victim. This could be through phishing, social engineering, or other delivery methods.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
