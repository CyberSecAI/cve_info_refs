SECURITY-359 / CVE-2022-30945
Pipeline: Groovy Plugin allows pipelines to load Groovy source files. This
is intended to be used to allow Global Shared Libraries to execute without
sandbox protection.

In Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2689.v434009a_31b_f1 and earlier, any Groovy
source files bundled with Jenkins core and plugins could be loaded this way
and their methods executed. If a suitable Groovy source file is available
on the classpath of Jenkins, sandbox protections can be bypassed.

NOTE: The Jenkins security team has been unable to identify any Groovy
source files in Jenkins core or plugins that would allow attackers to
execute dangerous code. While the severity of this issue is declared as
High due to the potential impact, successful exploitation is considered
very unlikely.

SECURITY-2116 / CVE-2022-30946
Script Security Plugin 1158.v7c1b_73a_69a_08 and earlier does not require
POST requests for a form validation endpoint, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to have Jenkins send an HTTP request to
an attacker-specific webserver.

SECURITY-2478 / CVE-2022-30947 (Git) & CVE-2022-30948 (Mercurial) & CVE-2022-30949 (REPO)
SCMs support a number of different URL schemes, including local file system
paths (e.g. using `file:` URLs).

Historically in Jenkins, only agents checked out from SCM, and if multiple
projects share the same agent, there is no expected isolation between
builds besides using different workspaces unless overridden. Some
Pipeline-related features check out SCMs from the Jenkins controller as
well.

This allows attackers able to configure pipelines to check out some SCM
repositories stored on the Jenkins controller's file system using local
paths as SCM URLs, obtaining limited information about other projects' SCM
contents. The following Jenkins plugins are known to be affected:

* Git 4.11.1 and earlier
* Mercurial 2.16 and earlier
* REPO 1.14.0 and earlier

SECURITY-2604 / CVE-2022-30950 (buffer overflow) & CVE-2022-30951 (access control)
WMI Windows Agents Plugin 1.8 and earlier includes the Windows Remote
Command library. It provides a general-purpose remote command execution
capability that Jenkins uses to check if Java is available, and if not, to
install it.

This library has a buffer overflow vulnerability that may allow users able
to connect to a named pipe to execute commands on the Windows agent
machine.

Additionally, while the processes are started as the user who connects to
the named pipe, no access control takes place, potentially allowing users
to start processes even if they're not allowed to log in.

SECURITY-714 / CVE-2022-30952
When pipelines are created using the pipeline creation wizard in Blue
Ocean, the credentials used are stored in the per-user credentials store of
the user creating the pipeline. To allow pipelines to use this credential
to scan repositories and checkout from SCM, the Blue Ocean Credentials
Provider allows pipelines to access a specific credential from the per-user
credentials store in Pipeline SCM API for Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.3 and
earlier.

As a result, attackers with Job/Configure permission can rewrite job
configurations in a way that lets them access and capture any
attacker-specified credential from any user's private credentials store.

SECURITY-2502 / CVE-2022-30953 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-30954 (permission check)
Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.3 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send requests to an
attacker-specified URL.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-2753 / CVE-2022-30955
GitLab Plugin 1.5.31 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an
HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-2600 / CVE-2022-30956
Rundeck Plugin 3.6.10 and earlier does not restrict URL schemes in Rundeck
webhook submissions.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to submit crafted Rundeck webhook payloads.

SECURITY-2315 / CVE-2022-30957
SSH Plugin 2.6.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP
endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2093 / CVE-2022-30958 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-30959 (permission check)
SSH Plugin 2.6.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP
endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2717 / CVE-2022-30960 through CVE-2022-30968
Multiple plugins do not escape the name and description of the parameter
types they provide:

* Application Detector Plugin 1.0.8 and earlier (SECURITY-2732 /
  CVE-2022-30960)
* Autocomplete Parameter Plugin 1.1 and earlier (SECURITY-2729 /
  CVE-2022-30961)
* Global Variable String Parameter Plugin 1.2 and earlier (SECURITY-2715 /
  CVE-2022-30962)
* JDK Parameter Plugin 1.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2713 / CVE-2022-30963)
* Multiselect parameter Plugin 1.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2726 /
  CVE-2022-30964)
* Promoted Builds (Simple) Plugin 1.9 and earlier (SECURITY-2720 /
  CVE-2022-30965)
* Random String Parameter Plugin 1.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2722 /
  CVE-2022-30966)
* Selection tasks Plugin 1.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2728 / CVE-2022-30967)
* vboxwrapper Plugin 1.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2734 / CVE-2022-30968)

This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilites
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed
on another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages
provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to
prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of
vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and
"Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the SECURITY-353 /
CVE-2017-2601 fix. Additionally, several plugins have previously been
updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default,
see SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for the
following plugins:

* Autocomplete Parameter Plugin 1.1 and earlier (SECURITY-2729 /
  CVE-2022-30961)
* Global Variable String Parameter Plugin 1.2 and earlier (SECURITY-2715 /
  CVE-2022-30962)
* JDK Parameter Plugin 1.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2713 / CVE-2022-30963)
* Promoted Builds (Simple) Plugin 1.9 and earlier (SECURITY-2720 /
  CVE-2022-30965)
* Random String Parameter Plugin 1.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2722 /
  CVE-2022-30966)
* Selection tasks Plugin 1.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2728 / CVE-2022-30967)
* vboxwrapper Plugin 1.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2734 / CVE-2022-30968)

SECURITY-2322 / CVE-2022-30969
Autocomplete Parameter Plugin 1.1 and earlier does not require POST
requests for a form validation endpoint executing a provided Groovy script,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code without
sandbox protection if the victim is an administrator.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2267 / CVE-2022-30970
Autocomplete Parameter Plugin 1.1 and earlier references Dropdown
Autocomplete parameter and Auto Complete String parameter names in an
unsafe manner from Javascript embedded in view definitions.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

NOTE: While this looks similar to SECURITY-2729, this is an independent
problem and exploitable even on views rendering parameters that otherwise
attempt to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in parameter names.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1969 / CVE-2022-30971 (XXE) & CVE-2022-30972 (CSRF)
Storable Configs Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser
to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to have Jenkins parse
a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from
the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Additionally, the HTTP endpoint calling the XML parser does not require
POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2824 (1) / CVE-2022-43401 through CVE-2022-43404
Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low
privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally
safe to execute. Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are
intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the
call is to be allowed.

Multiple sandbox bypass vulnerabilities exist in Script Security Plugin and
Pipeline: Groovy Plugin:

* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier and in
  Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2802.v5ea_628154b_c2 and earlier, various casts
  performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime were not intercepted
  by the sandbox.
  This includes casts performed when returning values from methods, when
  assigning local variables, fields, properties, and when defining default
  arguments for closure, constructor, and method parameters (CVE-2022-43401
  in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-43402 in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin).
* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, when
  casting an array-like value to an array type, per-element casts to the
  component type of the array are not intercepted by the sandbox
  (CVE-2022-43403).
* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, crafted
  constructor bodies and calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors
  can be used to construct any subclassable type (due to an incomplete fix
  for SECURITY-1754 in the 2020-03-09 security advisory) (CVE-2022-43404).

These vulnerabilities allow attackers with permission to define and run
sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection
and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

SECURITY-2824 (2) / CVE-2022-43405 (Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin)
  & CVE-2022-43406 (Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin)
Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin and older releases of the Pipeline:
Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin (formerly Pipeline: Shared Groovy
Libraries Plugin) define the `library` Pipeline step, which allows Pipeline
authors to dynamically load Pipeline libraries. The return value of this
step can be used to instantiate classes defined in the loaded library.

In Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin 612.v84da_9c54906d and earlier and in
Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 583.vf3b_454e43966 and
earlier, the `library` step can be used to invoke sandbox-generated
synthetic constructors in crafted untrusted libraries and construct any
subclassable type. This is similar to SECURITY-582 in the 2017-08-07
security advisory, but in a different plugin.

This vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define untrusted
Pipeline libraries and to define and run sandboxed Pipelines, to bypass the
sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins
controller JVM.

SECURITY-2880 / CVE-2022-43407
Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 and earlier does not
restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the `input` step. This
ID is used for the URLs that process user interactions for the given
`input` step (proceed or abort) and is not correctly encoded.

This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build
URLs from `input` step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any
target URL in Jenkins when the `input` step is interacted with.

SECURITY-2828 / CVE-2022-43408
Pipeline: Stage View Plugin provides a visualization of Pipeline builds. It
also allows users to interact with `input` steps from Pipeline: Input Step
Plugin.

Pipeline: Stage View Plugin 2.26 and earlier does not correctly encode the
ID of `input` steps when using it to generate URLs to proceed or abort
Pipeline builds.

This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to specify `input` step
IDs resulting in URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target
URL in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2881 / CVE-2022-43409
Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin provides a feature to add hyperlinks, that
send POST requests when clicked, to build logs. These links are used by
Pipeline: Input Step Plugin to allow users to proceed or abort the build,
or by Pipeline: Job Plugin to allow users to forcibly terminate the build
after aborting it.

Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin 838.va_3a_087b_4055b and earlier does not
sanitize or properly encode URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to create Pipelines.

SECURITY-2831 / CVE-2022-43410
Mercurial Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/mercurial/notifyCommit`
that can be used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository. This
endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for
all jobs configured with the specified repository. It can be accessed with
GET requests and without authentication.

In Mercurial Plugin 1251.va_b_121f184902 and earlier, the output of the
webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered
or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to
access. This allows attackers with knowledge of Mercurial repository URLs
to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this
Mercurial repository.

SECURITY-2877 / CVE-2022-43411
GitLab Plugin 1.5.35 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison
when checking whether the provided and expected webhook token are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid webhook token.

SECURITY-2874 / CVE-2022-43412
Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin 1.84.1 and earlier does not use a
constant-time comparison when checking whether the provided and expected
webhook token are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid webhook token.

SECURITY-2791 / CVE-2022-43413
Job Import Plugin 3.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an
HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-2551 / CVE-2022-43414
NUnit Plugin 0.27 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message
that parses files inside a user-specified directory as test results.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain test
results from files in an attacker-specified directory on the Jenkins
controller.

SECURITY-2337 / CVE-2022-43415
REPO Plugin 1.15.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent
XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control which `repo` binary is executed on
agents to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external
entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or
server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-2844 / CVE-2022-43416
Katalon Plugin 1.0.32 and earlier implements an agent/controller message
that does not limit where it can be executed and allows invoking Katalon
with configurable arguments.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to invoke Katalon on
the Jenkins controller with attacker-controlled version, install location,
and arguments. Attackers additionally able to create files on the Jenkins
controller (e.g., attackers with Item/Configure permission could archive
artifacts) can invoke arbitrary OS commands.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2845 (1) / CVE-2022-43417
Katalon Plugin 1.0.32 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2845 (2) / CVE-2022-43418
Katalon Plugin 1.0.33 and earlier does not require POST requests for
several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL
using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2846 / CVE-2022-43419
Katalon Plugin 1.0.32 and earlier stores API keys unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

These API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or
access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-2836 / CVE-2022-43420
Contrast Continuous Application Security Plugin 3.9 and earlier does not
escape data returned from the Contrast service when generating a report.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control or modify Contrast service API
responses.

SECURITY-2852 / CVE-2022-43421
Tuleap Git Branch Source Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at
`/tuleap-hook/` that can be used to trigger Tuleap projects configured with
a specified repository.

In Tuleap Git Branch Source Plugin 3.2.4 and earlier, this endpoint can be
accessed without authentication.

This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger Tuleap projects whose
configured repository matches the attacker-specified value.

SECURITY-2620 / CVE-2022-43422
Compuware Topaz Utilities Plugin 1.0.8 and earlier implements an
agent/controller message that does not limit where it can be executed.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of
Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2622 / CVE-2022-43423
Compuware Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and ISPW Plugin 2.0.12 and
earlier implements an agent/controller message that does not limit where it
can be executed.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of
Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2627 / CVE-2022-43424
Compuware Xpediter Code Coverage Plugin 1.0.7 and earlier implements an
agent/controller message that does not limit where it can be executed.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of
Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2797 / CVE-2022-43425
Custom Checkbox Parameter Plugin 1.4 and earlier does not escape the name
and description of the parameter types it provides.

This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilites
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that parameters are listed on
another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages
provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to
prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of
vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and
"Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the SECURITY-353 /
CVE-2017-2601 fix. Additionally, several plugins have previously been
updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default,
see SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2480 / CVE-2022-43426
S3 Explorer Plugin stores AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in its global configuration
file `s3explorer.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its
configuration.

While this secret is stored encrypted on disk, in S3 Explorer Plugin 1.0.8
and earlier the global configuration form does not mask the
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY form field, increasing the potential for attackers to
observe and capture it.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2623 / CVE-2022-43427
Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier does not perform
permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2624 / CVE-2022-43428 (Java system properties) & CVE-2022-43429 (read files)
Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier implements two
agent/controller messages that do not limit where they can be executed.

* `RemoteSystemProperties` allows attackers able to control agent processes
to obtain the values of Java system properties from the Jenkins
controller process (CVE-2022-43428).
* `GetRemoteUTF8FileContents` allows attackers able to control agent
processes to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system
(CVE-2022-43429).

NOTE: These vulnerabilities are only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and
earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2625 / CVE-2022-43430
Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier does not configure
its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for the 'Topaz for
Total Test - Execute Total Test scenarios' build step to have Jenkins parse
a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2631 / CVE-2022-43431
Compuware Strobe Measurement Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2863 / CVE-2022-43432
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

XFramium Builder Plugin 1.0.22 and earlier globally disables the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins as soon
as it is loaded. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users
with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2864 / CVE-2022-43433
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

ScreenRecorder Plugin 0.7 and earlier programmatically updates the
Java system property allowing administrators to customize the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins to
include `media-src: 'self'`. On a Jenkins instance with default
configuration, this effectively disables all other directives in the
default rule set, including `script-src`. This allows cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces,
archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2865 / CVE-2022-43434
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.20 and earlier globally disables
the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins
whenever the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' build step is executed. This
allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to
control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2866 / CVE-2022-43435
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

360 FireLine Plugin 1.7.2 and earlier globally disables the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins
whenever the 'Execute FireLine' build step is executed, if the option 'Open
access to HTML with JS or CSS' is checked. This allows cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces,
archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-02-01

This advisory announces multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins.

## Description

### Use of AES ECB block cipher mode without IV for encrypting secrets

**SECURITY-304 / CVE-2017-2598**

Secrets such as passwords are typically stored on disk and sent to users as part of some pages in encrypted form. These were encrypted using AES-128 ECB without IV, which exposes Jenkins and the stored secrets to unnecessary risks. Jenkins now encrypts secrets using AES-128 CBC with random IV.

### Items could be created with same name as existing item

**SECURITY-321 / CVE-2017-2599**

An insufficient permission check allowed users with the permission to create new items (e.g. jobs) to overwrite existing items they don’t have access to. After a Jenkins restart, children of the original item, such as builds, were then accessible in some circumstances.

### Node monitor data could be viewed by low privilege users

**SECURITY-343 / CVE-2017-2600**

Overall/Read permission was sufficient to access node monitor data via the remote API. These included system configuration and runtime information of these nodes.

### Possible cross-site scripting vulnerability in jQuery bundled with timeline widget

**SECURITY-349 / CVE-2011-4969**

The Simile timeline widget used on build history pages bundles an outdated jQuery vulnerable to CVE-2011-4969. We were unable to confirm that Jenkins is vulnerable, but updated the jQuery version bundled with the Simile timeline widget anyway.

### Persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability in parameter names and descriptions

**SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601**

Users with the permission to configure jobs were able to inject JavaScript into parameter names and descriptions.

### Outdated jbcrypt version bundled with Jenkins

**SECURITY-354 / CVE-2015-0886**

Jenkins bundled an outdated version of jbcrypt that was affected by CVE-2015-0886.

### Pipeline metadata files not excluded in agent-to-controller security subsystem

**SECURITY-358 / CVE-2017-2602**

The Pipeline suite of plugins stored build metadata in the file `program.dat` and the directory `workflow/`. These were not excluded in the [agent-to-controller security subsystem](/security-144) and could therefore be written to by malicious agents.

### User data leak in disconnected agents' config.xml API

**SECURITY-362 / CVE-2017-2603**

Agents that were disconnected by users contained the disconnecting user’s `User` object in serialized form in the `config.xml` remote API output. This could leak sensitive data such as API tokens.

### Low privilege users were able to act on administrative monitors

**SECURITY-371 / CVE-2017-2604**

Administrative monitors are warnings about the system state shown to Jenkins admins. They sometimes provide actions to e.g. automatically address the reported problem, or disable the warning. These actions were not consistently protected by permission checks, thereby allowing low privilege users to act on them.

All administrative monitors now require the user accessing them to be an administrator.

### Re-key admin monitor leaves behind unencrypted credentials in upgraded installations

**SECURITY-376 / CVE-2017-1000362**

The re-key admin monitor was introduced in Jenkins 1.498 and re-encrypted all secrets in JENKINS\_HOME with a new key. It also created a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards.

Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. **Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory `$JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups`, and delete it if present.**

### Internal API allowed access to item names that should not be visible

**SECURITY-380 / CVE-2017-2606**

The method `Jenkins#getItems()` included a performance optimization that resulted in all items being returned if the *Logged in users can do anything* authorization strategy was used, and no access was granted to anonymous users (an option added in Jenkins 2.0). This only affects anonymous users (other users legitimately have access) that were able to get a list of items via an `UnprotectedRootAction`.

### Persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability in console notes

**SECURITY-382 / CVE-2017-2607**

Jenkins allows plugins to annotate build logs, adding new content or changing the presentation of existing content while the build is running. Popular examples include the highlighting of sections by [Ant Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ant), or the timestamp metadata from [Timestamper](https://plugins.jenkins.io/timestamper). Malicious Jenkins users, or users with SCM access, could configure jobs or modify build scripts such that they print serialized console notes that perform cross-site scripting attacks on Jenkins users viewing the build logs.

To prevent this, console notes are now signed by Jenkins when created, and Jenkins will only deserialize correctly signed console notes. **As a side effect, console notes created before updating to a release containing this fix will no longer be deserialized.** To restore the previous (unsafe) behavior, set the system property `hudson.console.ConsoleNote.INSECURE` to `true` as described on [Features controlled by system properties](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/).

### XStream remote code execution vulnerability

**SECURITY-383 / CVE-2017-2608**

XStream-based APIs in Jenkins (e.g. `/createItem` URLs, or `POST config.xml` remote API) were vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability involving the deserialization of various types in `javax.imageio`.

In case this extension of the blocklist results in regressions, the blocklist can be customized as described [in the Jenkins LTS upgrade guide for Jenkins 2.19.3](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.19/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-19-3).

### Information disclosure vulnerability in search suggestions

**SECURITY-385 / CVE-2017-2609**

The autocompletion for the search box provided the names of views the current user does not have access to in its suggestions. These suggestions were removed.

### Persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability in search suggestions

**SECURITY-388 / CVE-2017-2610**

Jenkins allows the creation of users with less-than and greater-than characters in their names. These user names were not escaped when displaying search suggestions, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

### Insufficient permission check for periodic processes

**SECURITY-389 / CVE-2017-2611**

The URLs `/workspaceCleanup` and `/fingerprintCleanup` did not perform permission checks, allowing users with read access to Jenkins to trigger these background processes (that are otherwise performed daily), possibly causing additional load on Jenkins controller and agents.

### Low privilege users were able to override JDK download credentials

**SECURITY-392 / CVE-2017-2612**

Jenkins allows administrators to enter their username and password to the Oracle download site which provides JDKs for download. Users with read access to Jenkins were able to override these credentials, resulting in future builds possibly failing to download a JDK. A permission check has been added.

### User creation CSRF using GET by admins

**SECURITY-406 / CVE-2017-2613**

When administrators accessed a URL like `/user/example` via HTTP GET, a user with the ID `example` was created if it did not exist. While this user record was only retained until restart in most cases, administrators' web browsers could be manipulated to create a large number of user records.

Accessing these URLs now no longer results in a user record getting created, Jenkins will respond with 404 Not Found if no such user exists. When using the internal Jenkins user database, new users can be created via *Manage Jenkins Â» Manage Users*. To restore the previous (unsafe) behavior, set the system property `hudson.model.User.allowUserCreationViaUrl` to `true` as described on [Features controlled by system properties](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/).

SECURITY-2781 / CVE-2022-34170 through CVE-2022-34173
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Jenkins 2.355 and
earlier, LTS 2.332.3 and earlier allow attackers to inject HTML and
JavaScript into the Jenkins UI:

* SECURITY-2779 (CVE-2022-34170): Since Jenkins 2.320 and LTS 2.332.1, help
  icon tooltips no longer escape the feature name, effectively undoing the
  fix for SECURITY-1955.
* SECURITY-2761 (CVE-2022-34171): Since Jenkins 2.321 and LTS 2.332.1, the
  HTML output generated for new symbol-based SVG icons includes the `title`
  attribute of `l:ionicon` until Jenkins 2.334 and `alt` attribute of
  `l:icon` since Jenkins 2.335 without further escaping.
* SECURITY-2776 (CVE-2022-34172): Since Jenkins 2.340, symbol-based icons
  unescape previously escaped values of `tooltip` parameters.
* SECURITY-2780 (CVE-2022-34173): Since Jenkins 2.340, the tooltip of the
  build button in list views supports HTML without escaping the job display
  name.

These vulnerabilities are known to be exploitable by attackers with
Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2566 / CVE-2022-34174
In Jenkins 2.355 and earlier, LTS 2.332.3 and earlier, an observable timing
discrepancy on the login form allows distinguishing between login attempts
with an invalid username, and login attempts with a valid username and
wrong password, when using the Jenkins user database security realm. This
allows attackers to determine the validity of attacker-specified usernames.

SECURITY-2777 / CVE-2022-34175
Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views. These views
are frequently composed of several view fragments, enabling plugins to
extend existing views with more content.

Before SECURITY-534 was fixed in Jenkins 2.186 and LTS 2.176.2, attackers
could in some cases directly access a view fragment containing sensitive
information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.

In Jenkins 2.335 through 2.355 (both inclusive), the protection added for
SECURITY-534 is disabled for some views. As a result, attackers could in
very limited cases directly access a view fragment containing sensitive
information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.

NOTE: As of publication, the Jenkins security team is unaware of any
vulnerable view fragment across the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.

SECURITY-2760 / CVE-2022-34176
JUnit Plugin 1119.va_a_5e9068da_d7 and earlier does not escape descriptions
of test results.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Run/Update permission.

SECURITY-2705 / CVE-2022-34177
Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 448.v37cea_9a_10a_70 and earlier allows
Pipeline authors to specify `file` parameters for Pipeline `input` steps
even though they are unsupported. Although the uploaded file is not copied
to the workspace, Jenkins archives the file on the controller as part of
build metadata using the parameter name without sanitization as a relative
path inside a build-related directory.

This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to create or replace
arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system with
attacker-specified content.

SECURITY-2567 / CVE-2022-34178
Embeddable Build Status Plugin 2.0.3 allows specifying a `link` query
parameter that build status badges will link to, without restricting
possible values.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-2792 / CVE-2022-34179
Embeddable Build Status Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier allows specifying a
`style` query parameter that is used to choose a different SVG image style
without restricting possible values.

This results in a relative path traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers
without Overall/Read permission to specify paths to other SVG images on the
Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-2794 / CVE-2022-34180
Embeddable Build Status Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier does not correctly perform
the ViewStatus permission check in the HTTP endpoint it provides for
"unprotected" status badge access.

This allows attackers without any permissions to obtain the build status
badge icon for any attacker-specified job and/or build.

SECURITY-2549 / CVE-2022-34181
xUnit Plugin 3.0.8 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message
that creates a user-specified directory if it doesn't exist, and parsing
files inside it as test results.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to create an
arbitrary directory on the Jenkins controller or to obtain test results
from existing files in an attacker-specified directory.

SECURITY-2768 / CVE-2022-34182
Nested View Plugin 1.20 through 1.25 (both inclusive) does not escape
search parameters.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-2784 / CVE-2022-34183 through CVE-2022-34198
Multiple plugins do not escape the name and description of the parameter
types they provide:

* Agent Server Parameter 1.1 and earlier (SECURITY-2731 / CVE-2022-34183)
* CRX Content Package Deployer 1.9 and earlier (SECURITY-2727 /
  CVE-2022-34184)
* Date Parameter Plugin 0.0.4 and earlier (SECURITY-2711 / CVE-2022-34185)
* Dynamic Extended Choice Parameter 1.0.1 and earlier (SECURITY-2712 /
  CVE-2022-34186)

This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilites
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed
on another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages
provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to
prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of
vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and
"Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the SECURITY-353 /
CVE-2017-2601 fix. Additionally, several plugins have previously been
updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default,
see SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list.

SECURITY-2617 / CVE-2022-29036 through CVE-2022-29046
Multiple plugins do not escape the name and description of the parameter
types they provide:

* Credentials Plugin 1111.v35a_307992395 and earlier (SECURITY-2690 /
  CVE-2022-29036)
* CVS Plugin 2.19 and earlier (SECURITY-2700 / CVE-2022-29037)
* Extended Choice Parameter Plugin 346.vd87693c5a_86c and earlier
  (SECURITY-2704 / CVE-2022-29038)
* Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.35.2 and earlier (SECURITY-2703 / CVE-2022-29039)
* Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.15 and earlier (SECURITY-2699 / CVE-2022-29040)
* Jira Plugin 3.7 and earlier (SECURITY-2691 / CVE-2022-29041)
* Job Generator 1.22 and earlier (SECURITY-2263 / CVE-2022-29042)
* Mask Passwords Plugin 3.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2701 / CVE-2022-29043)
* Node and Label parameter Plugin 1.10.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2702 /
  CVE-2022-29044)
* promoted builds Plugin 873.v6149db_d64130 and earlier (SECURITY-2692 /
  CVE-2022-29045)
* Subversion Plugin 2.15.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2698 / CVE-2022-29046)

This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed
on another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages
provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to
prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of
vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and
"Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the SECURITY-353 /
CVE-2017-2601 fix. Additionally, the following plugins have been updated to
list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default.

* promoted builds Plugin 876.v99d29788b_36b_ and 3.10.1 (SECURITY-2670)
* Pipeline: Build Step Plugin 2.17 and 2.15.2 (SECURITY-2611)
* Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 447.v95e5a_6e3502a_ and 2.12.1 (SECURITY-2674)
* Rebuilder Plugin 1.33.1 (SECURITY-2671)
* Maven Release Plugin 0.16.3 (SECURITY-2669)
* Release Plugin 2.14 (SECURITY-2672)

Older releases of these plugins allow exploitation of the vulnerabilities
listed above.

As of publication of this advisory, the following plugins have not yet been
updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation of these
vulnerabilities:

* Show Build Parameters Plugin (SECURITY-2325)
* Coordinator Plugin (SECURITY-2668)
* Unleash Maven Plugin (SECURITY-2673)

These are not vulnerabilities in these plugins. Only plugins defining
parameter types can be considered to be vulnerable to this issue.

NOTE: Some plugins both define parameter types and implement a page listing
parameters, so they can appear in multiple lists and may have both a
security fix and a security hardening applied.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for the
following plugins:

* Extended Choice Parameter Plugin (SECURITY-2704 / CVE-2022-29038)
* Job Generator (SECURITY-2263 / CVE-2022-29042)

SECURITY-1951 / CVE-2022-29047
Multibranch Pipelines by default limit who can change the Pipeline
definition from the Jenkinsfile. This is useful for SCMs like GitHub:
Jenkins can build content from users without commit access, but who can
submit pull requests, without granting them the ability to modify the
Pipeline definition. In that case, Jenkins will just use the Pipeline
definition in the pull request's destination branch instead.

In Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin 564.ve62a_4eb_b_e039 and
earlier the same protection does not apply to uses of the `library` step
with a `retriever` argument pointing to a library in the current build's
repository and branch (e.g., `library(…, retriever: legacySCM(scm))`). This
allows attackers able to submit pull requests (or equivalent), but not able
to commit directly to the configured SCM, to effectively change the
Pipeline behavior by changing the library behavior in their pull request,
even if the Pipeline is configured to not trust them.

SECURITY-2075 / CVE-2022-29048
Subversion Plugin 2.15.3 and earlier does not require POST requests for
several form validation methods, resulting in cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to connect to an attacker-specified
URL.

SECURITY-2655 / CVE-2022-29049
promoted builds Plugin provides dedicated support for defining promotions
using Job DSL Plugin.

promoted builds Plugin 873.v6149db_d64130 and earlier does not validate the
names of promotions defined in Job DSL. This allows attackers with
Job/Configure permission to create a promotion with an unsafe name. As a
result, the promotion name could be used for cross-site scripting (XSS) or
to replace other `config.xml` files.

SECURITY-2321 / CVE-2022-29050 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-29051 (missing permission check)
Publish Over FTP Plugin 1.16 and earlier does not perform permission checks
in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an FTP
server using attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-2045 / CVE-2022-29052
Google Compute Engine Plugin 4.3.8 and earlier stores private keys
unencrypted in cloud agent `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as
part of its configuration.

These private keys can be viewed by users with Agent/Extended Read
permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-2316 / CVE-2022-34777
GitLab Plugin 1.5.34 and earlier does not escape multiple user-provided
values shown as part of the build case of webhook-triggered builds.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2788 / CVE-2022-34778
TestNG Results Plugin has options in its post-build step configuration to
not escape test descriptions and exception messages.

If those options are unchecked, TestNG Results Plugin 554.va4a552116332 and
earlier renders the unescaped text provided in test results.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to configure jobs or control test results.

SECURITY-2773 (1) / CVE-2022-34779
XebiaLabs XL Release Plugin 22.0.0 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-2773 (2) / CVE-2022-34780 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-34781 (missing authorization)
XebiaLabs XL Release Plugin 22.0.0 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-2650 / CVE-2022-34782
requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.16 and earlier does not correctly perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of
pending requests.

NOTE: This is basically the same vulnerability as SECURITY-1995, whose fix
was ineffective.

SECURITY-2220 / CVE-2022-34783
Plot Plugin 2.1.10 and earlier does not escape plot descriptions.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1118 / CVE-2022-34784
build-metrics Plugin 1.3 does not escape the build description on one of
its views.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Build/Update permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2643 / CVE-2022-34785
build-metrics Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not perform a permission check in
multiple HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain information
about jobs otherwise inaccessible to them.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2332 / CVE-2022-34786
Rich Text Publisher Plugin 1.4 and earlier does not escape the HTML message
set by its post-build step.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1919 / CVE-2022-34787
Project Inheritance Plugin 21.04.03 and earlier does not escape the reason
a build is blocked in tooltips.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to control the reason a queue item is blocked.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1926 / CVE-2022-34788
Matrix Reloaded Plugin 1.1.3 and earlier does not escape the agent name in
tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Agent/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2016 / CVE-2022-34789
Matrix Reloaded Plugin 1.1.3 and earlier does not require POST requests for
an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to rebuild previous matrix builds.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1939 / CVE-2022-34790
eXtreme Feedback Panel Plugin 2.0.1 and earlier does not escape the job
names used in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2165 / CVE-2022-34791
Validating Email Parameter Plugin 1.10 and earlier does not escape the name
and description of its parameter type.

Additionally, it disables the security hardening added in Jenkins 2.44 and
LTS 2.32.2 as part of the SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601 fix that protects
the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages from vulnerabilities
like this by default.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2000 / CVE-2022-34792 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-34793 (XXE) &
CVE-2022-34794 (missing permission check)
Recipe Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in
multiple HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request
to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.

As the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external
entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML
response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the
Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Additionally, the plugin allows users to export the full configuration of
jobs as part of a recipe, granting access to job configuration XML data to
every user with Item/Read permission. The encrypted values of secrets
stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the
config.xml API for users without Item/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2799 / CVE-2022-34795
Deployment Dashboard Plugin 1.0.10 and earlier does not escape environment
names on its Deployment Dashboard view.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with View/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2798 (1) / CVE-2022-34796
Deployment Dashboard Plugin 1.0.10 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
