Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue related to the disclosure of the CSRF protection token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The system improperly handles CSRF tokens, leading to their exposure.
- Insufficient CSRF Protection: The vulnerability implies a weakness in the implementation or handling of CSRF tokens in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Exposure of CSRF tokens can allow attackers to craft malicious requests on behalf of the victim.
- Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized actions being performed by the victim's account

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:N)
- Requires user interaction (UI:R).
- Exploitation does not require any privileges (PR:N).
- The attack does not change the security scope (S:U).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to entice a user to perform an action. This would mean they would have to trick a user into clicking a link or accessing a malicious website.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the system.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-2093 is an information disclosure vulnerability where the CSRF protection token is revealed, leading to the possibility of unauthorized actions if combined with other exploits. The attack is network-based and requires user interaction, but no privileges are needed.
