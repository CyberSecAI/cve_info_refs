Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2017-2666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper parsing of the HTTP request line by the Undertow web server component. Specifically, the code allowed invalid characters in HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The primary vulnerability is HTTP request smuggling. By permitting invalid characters in the HTTP request line, an attacker can potentially manipulate the interpretation of the request by intermediaries, such as proxies, that may handle these invalid characters differently.
*   **Response Splitting:** This improper handling of the HTTP request line can be combined with proxies having different interpretations of invalid characters to perform response splitting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Web Cache Poisoning:** By injecting malicious content into the HTTP response, an attacker could poison a web cache, leading to a situation where subsequent users receive the manipulated response.
*   **XSS Attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTTP response, thus performing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on unsuspecting users.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** By manipulating the HTTP response, attackers could potentially obtain sensitive information from other usersâ€™ requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests that include invalid characters within the request line (e.g., URL path or parameters).
*   Exploitation requires a vulnerable Undertow instance and a proxy server that interprets invalid characters differently.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need direct access to the vulnerable server; the exploitation can be through a vulnerable proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server (or a proxy in front of the vulnerable server).
*   The attacker needs to understand the differences in handling of invalid characters in the HTTP request line between the Undertow server and the proxy server to craft effective exploits.
*   The attacker does not require authentication or any special privileges on the vulnerable server to carry out the attack.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located within the Undertow web server.
*   The issue arises from the permissiveness of invalid characters when parsing the HTTP request line.
*   The Red Hat Security Team attributes this issue's discovery to Radim Hatlapatka (Red Hat).
*   The fix involves ensuring strict parsing of the HTTP request line.
*   The fix was not initially complete, leading to the follow up CVE-2017-7559

**Affected Software:**
The following products are affected:
* Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 7.0
* Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 7.1
* Red Hat JBoss Fuse
* undertow component

**Resolution:**
The vulnerability is resolved by updating affected packages. Refer to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) such as RHSA-2017:1409, RHSA-2017:1410, RHSA-2017:1411, RHSA-2017:1412, RHSA-2017:3454, RHSA-2017:3455, RHSA-2017:3456, and RHSA-2017:3458 which address this issue. Upstream fix is tracked at JIRA UNDERTOW-1251.

**Note:**
It is also important to note that CVE-2017-7559 was opened as a direct result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-2666, meaning the fix for 2666 was not comprehensive and that invalid characters were still allowed in the query string and path parameters

**More details on the fix:**
The fix ensures strict parsing of the HTTP request line to reject invalid characters
