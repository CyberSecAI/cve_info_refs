Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the ImageConversion's TIFF parsing functionality in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. The software fails to properly validate user-supplied data during the processing of TIFF images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
An out-of-bounds write vulnerability is present. Specifically, the inadequate validation of user-supplied data leads to a write operation that exceeds the boundaries of an allocated memory object. This memory corruption issue could lead to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This means the attacker can gain control of the system with the same privileges as the user running the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:
   -   Tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.
   -   Luring a user into opening a malicious TIFF file or a PDF document containing a malicious TIFF image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to:
   -  Craft a malicious TIFF file or web page containing a specially crafted TIFF image that exploits the parsing vulnerability.
   -  Socially engineer or trick the user into opening the malicious file or visiting the malicious website.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID 26536.
- Adobe released an update to address this vulnerability, and it is listed with other CVEs in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB17-01.
