Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the design setting screen of Cybozu Office.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies or other sensitive information
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the design setting screen of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user to exploit the vulnerability (as indicated by the CVSS v2 vector `Au:S` and CVSS v3 vector `PR:L`).
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the design settings of Cybozu Office (likely a user with design modification permissions)
- The user would need to interact with the malicious script, as it is a reflected XSS vulnerability (as indicated by the CVSS v3 vector `UI:R`)
