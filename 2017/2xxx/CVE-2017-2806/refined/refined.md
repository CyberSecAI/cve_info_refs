- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of XLS documents by the Lexmark Document Filter. Specifically, when parsing a `Hyperlink Object`, the library reads the length of the `displayName` string from the file without proper validation. This length is then used to calculate the pointer to the `targetFrameName` field. By providing a large length value for `displayName`, an attacker can cause the library to read from an arbitrary memory location when trying to access `targetFrameName`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) due to a lack of sanitization of the read string length.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary read, leading to memory disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted XLS file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XLS file to the vulnerable software for processing.
