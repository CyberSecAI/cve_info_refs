Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue, meaning an attacker can manipulate file paths to access resources outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when handling file paths. This allows an attacker to traverse the file system and potentially access sensitive files or directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can access arbitrary local files on the server.
- **Data Manipulation:**  An administrator can delete arbitrary local files outside of the WBCE CMS installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when constructing file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable WBCE CMS.
- **No Authentication:** The directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.  However, deleting arbitrary files requires an admin-level account.

**Summary of Information:**

The provided content details that WBCE CMS versions 1.1.10 and earlier are vulnerable to a directory traversal flaw (CVE-2017-2119). An attacker can exploit this to access sensitive files on the server. Furthermore, an administrator could potentially delete arbitrary files outside the CMS installation. The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker over the network due to the applicationâ€™s failure to sanitize file paths. The vendor released a patch in version 1.1.11 to address this vulnerability along with other security issues.

The forum discussion also reveals a related issue with the update script where the hardcoded admin directory path can cause issues if the admin folder has been renamed. While this is not the primary vulnerability (CVE-2017-2119), it highlights a related problem in the update process.
