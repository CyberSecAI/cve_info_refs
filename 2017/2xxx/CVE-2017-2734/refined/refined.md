- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Improper input parameter validation in a specific interface of Huawei smartphones, leading to excessive memory allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation, which allows an attacker to trigger excessive memory allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a system crash due to memory exhaustion, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious application installed on the smartphone by tricking the user. The malicious app sends specific parameters to a vulnerable interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application. The malicious application can then trigger the vulnerability locally on the phone.
