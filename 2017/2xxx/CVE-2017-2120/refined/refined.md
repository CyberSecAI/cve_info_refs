Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2017-2120) in WBCE CMS:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the WBCE CMS application. This means that the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied inputs when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query and inject their own malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The core weakness is the failure to properly sanitize input before it's used in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unexpected SQL command may be executed by a WBCE CMS administrator. This can allow a malicious administrator to perform actions such as:
  -  Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database).
  - Data modification (changing existing data).
  - Data deletion.
  - Possibly gaining control of the server by leveraging the database to execute operating system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface. A high privileged user (administrator) of WBCE CMS is required for the exploitation. The attacker manipulates input data, which are then used to construct SQL queries, without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user (administrator) of the WBCE CMS application.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious input data to be used in the vulnerable SQL query.
