- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla extension "Easy Joomla Backup" creates backup files with predictable names based on a timestamp and stores them in a publicly accessible web directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable backup file names and insecure storage location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive database information, including usernames, passwords, and potentially other confidential data if the backup file is downloaded.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can brute-force the backup file names by guessing the timestamp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target website, and doesn't need any user credentials to the Joomla instance.
