Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2654:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Email Extension Plugin, like the Mailer plugin, could send emails to a dynamically created list of users based on changelogs (e.g., authors of SCM changes).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The email recipient list generation is based on change logs, where the local-part of email addresses could be mapped to users who are not actual Jenkins users, and in some rare cases, not even involved in the project.
- There is no proper validation or association of email addresses with actual Jenkins users before sending emails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Emails could be sent to unintended recipients who do not have accounts on the Jenkins server.
- In rare cases, emails might be sent to individuals not associated with the project being built, leading to potential information disclosure or confusion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a build process in Jenkins that uses the Email Extension plugin.
- The recipient list is automatically created based on the commit history of a project.
- Attackers could potentially craft commits with email addresses designed to target specific people.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers do not need to be Jenkins users, and can be anyone who can create a commit.
- Attackers could influence commit history through the SCM used by the Jenkins project.

**Additional Notes:**

- This is a low severity issue.
- The vulnerability exists in Email Extension Plugin up to and including version 2.57.
- The fix is in Email Extension Plugin version 2.57.1.
- The issue is related to CVE-2017-2651, which affects the Mailer plugin and has the same root cause.
