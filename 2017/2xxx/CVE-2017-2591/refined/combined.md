Agreed. tmp\_config->attrs is not NULL terminated... It has to be one sizeof(char *) longer for it. :(

Apparently this got a CVE attached to it .... <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/01/18/5>

I want to describe the flaw in this CVE analysis. The CVE request states:

{{{

A attacker, authenticated, but possibly also unauthenticated, could

possibly force the plugin to read beyond allocated memory and trigger a

segfault.

}}}

This is incorrect. Only an authenticated user, with *write* access to cn=config, specifically the uiduniq plugin configuration can trigger this. In a default install this is *only* directory manager. If you are directory manager, you can do so many other things, there is no need to trigger an exploit.

This is why I deemed this a stability issue, not a security issue.

Users who are anonymous or bound from a backend do *not* have access to trigger this.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1381481#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-10-04 08:58:22 UTC  ``` The "attribute uniqueness" plugin did not properly NULL-terminate an array when building up its configuration, if a so called 'old-style' configuration, was being used (Using nsslapd-pluginarg<X> parameters) .  A attacker, authenticated, but possibly also unauthenticated, could possibly force the plugin to read beyond allocated memory and trigger a segfault.  The crash could also possibly be triggered accidentally.  Upstream patch :<https://fedorahosted.org/389/changeset/ffda694dd622b31277da07be76d3469fad86150f/> Affected versions : from 1.3.4.0  Fixed version : 1.3.6  Upstream bug report : <https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/48986>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1381481#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-10-04 09:01:26 UTC  ```  Created 389-ds-base tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1381483](show_bug.cgi?id=1381483 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-2591 389-ds-base: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1381481#c2)  Noriko Hosoi    2016-11-14 22:07:51 UTC  ``` Fixed in 389-ds-base-1.3.6 and newer.  Note: 389-ds-base-1.3.6 is available for F26 (current rawhide).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1381481#c9)  Cedric Buissart    2017-01-19 10:56:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.   ``` |  |
