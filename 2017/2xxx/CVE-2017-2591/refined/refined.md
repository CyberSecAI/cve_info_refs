Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `uniqueness_entry_to_config` function within the "attribute uniqueness" plugin of 389 Directory Server fails to properly NULL-terminate an array used in configuration when processing 'old-style' configurations (using `nsslapd-pluginarg<X>` parameters).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The lack of NULL termination in the array leads to an out-of-bounds read on the heap when the plugin attempts to access or iterate through the configuration data, specifically while reading the attribute name of the plugin configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash (Segfault):** An attacker can trigger the heap buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the LDAP service (ns-slapd).
- **Denial of Service:** The crash of the LDAP service results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the plugin's configuration through `cn=config` entries using the `nsslapd-pluginarg<X>` parameters to specify the attribute to be unique.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with *write* access to the `cn=config` configuration entry. In a default installation, only the directory manager has this access.
- **Write access to cn=config:** Specifically the attacker needs write access to the uiduniq plugin configuration to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is considered a stability issue rather than a high-severity security issue because it requires administrative access to the configuration, which an attacker who has already gained such access can use to carry out much more damaging actions than a service crash.
- The vulnerability affects 389-ds-base versions from 1.3.4.0 up to, but not including, 1.3.6.
- The issue was fixed in version 1.3.6 and later.
- The fix was implemented by allocating an additional element when calling `slapi_ch_calloc` so the array can be properly null terminated.
- The vulnerability can also be triggered accidentally.
