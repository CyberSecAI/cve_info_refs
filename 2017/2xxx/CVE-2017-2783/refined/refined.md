- **Root Cause:** Heap corruption vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds write in the `FillRowFormat` function of AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter when processing a crafted XLS file. The size of the memory to be cleared by `memset` is calculated using values read from the malicious file, without proper bounds checking, causing it to write beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Insufficient bounds checking:** The code does not properly validate the column index (`col` value) read from the XLS file, allowing it to exceed the allowed limits. Specifically, there is no check to ensure that the `col` value does not exceed `colMac` or 0x00FF.
  - **Heap Overflow:** The size of the buffer to be cleared is calculated based on attacker controlled input, leading to an out-of-bounds write that overwrites heap memory.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. The heap corruption can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted XLS file to the affected software (AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter).
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XLS file that is processed by the vulnerable software. This could be done by sending the file to a user of MarkLogic, which utilizes the affected software for document conversions.

**Additional Details:**

- The report provides detailed information about the vulnerable code, including the `InitMem` function responsible for allocating the buffer, the `FillRowFormat` function where the overflow occurs, and the `NumberRec` function where the attacker-controlled size value is extracted.
- It includes a full crash log and register information for debugging.
- It pinpoints that the vulnerable value comes from a specific record type, and the documentation for it.
