Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `read_legacy_biff` function of FreeXL 1.0.3. This function parses old BIFF format XLS files, specifically when handling the DIMENSION record.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled `record_size`:** The `record_size` is read directly from the XLS file without any validation.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The size read from the file is used in a `fread` operation to read into the `workbook->record` buffer, which has a fixed size of 8224 bytes. If the `record_size` is larger than this, it causes a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Size Checks:** The code doesn't check if the `record_size` is within the allowed limit before copying data into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the heap overflow, an attacker can overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Even if code execution is not achieved, the memory corruption can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XLS File:** An attacker crafts a specially designed XLS file with a large `record_size` value for the DIMENSION record.
*   **File Parsing:** When the vulnerable FreeXL library parses this malicious XLS file using the `read_legacy_biff` function, the buffer overflow is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to deliver the malicious file:**  The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted XLS file to a user or system that will process it using the vulnerable FreeXL library.
*   **No authentication or special privileges are required** to exploit this vulnerability once the file is delivered.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious XLS file using an application that depends on the vulnerable FreeXL library for parsing XLS files

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `read_legacy_biff` function when parsing the DIMENSION record of old BIFF formatted XLS files.
*   The `record_size` is read from the file using `fread` and `memcpy` operations without any size check.
*   The `workbook->record` buffer, where the data is read, has a fixed size of 8224 bytes, making it vulnerable to overflow if the `record_size` is larger.

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3976-1) confirms that the issue has been addressed in `freexl` versions:

*   1.0.0g-1+deb8u4 for oldstable (jessie)
*   1.0.2-2+deb9u1 for stable (stretch)
*   1.0.4-1 for unstable (sid)
