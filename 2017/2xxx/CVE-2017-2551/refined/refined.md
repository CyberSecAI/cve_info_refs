Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The BackWPup plugin generates a random string for backup storage, but uses the same string to create the storage directory under `wp-content/uploads/`. This directory, in many WordPress installations, allows for file listings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Storage Location:** The random string intended to obscure the backup location is also used for the directory name, making it discoverable via directory listing.
*   **Brute-Forceable Filenames:** The filename structure consists of a date and timestamp, making it brute-forceable with a limited number of attempts per day (maximum 86400).
*   **Lack of Proper Access Control:** The backup files are stored in a publicly accessible directory `wp-content/uploads`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive backup files, including the database, which can lead to full site compromise.
*   **Confidentiality Loss:** Database contents may contain sensitive user data, passwords, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Directory Listing:** Attackers can list the contents of the `wp-content/uploads/` directory to find the randomly generated string used for the backup directory.
*   **Brute-Force File Location:** Once the random string is discovered, the attacker can brute-force the backup filename, which follows a predictable date/time stamp format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site to perform directory listings and attempt to download the backup files.
*   **Basic Scripting Knowledge:** The provided exploit code is a basic bash script and demonstrates the simplicity of exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content includes an exploit script.
* The exploit uses a google dork to locate vulnerable sites `inurl:wp-content/uploads/backwpup`
