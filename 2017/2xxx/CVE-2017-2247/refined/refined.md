- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The self-extracting archive files created by Lhaz or Lhaz+ insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who invokes the self-extracting archive.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs when a user opens a specially crafted self-extracting archive file created by vulnerable versions of Lhaz or Lhaz+.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious self-extracting archive. The user must then execute the archive for the exploit to succeed.
