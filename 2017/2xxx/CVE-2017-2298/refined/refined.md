Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-2298:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation on the `identity` string when writing public key files during two-way automatic public key distribution. The `identity` was used to construct the filename for storing public keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness was the susceptibility to directory traversal attacks. By manipulating the `identity` string (e.g., using "../test"), an attacker could potentially write public keys to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, overwriting existing files, including trusted public key certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Public Key Overwriting:** An attacker could overwrite trusted public keys. This could potentially enable the attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or gain unauthorized access if the overwritten keys are used in an authentication process.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By crafting malicious `identity` strings, the attacker could overwrite any file that the application had write access to.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the two-way automatic public key distribution process, where the identity string provided by a remote peer is used to create a file name where the peer's public key is stored locally.
*   A malicious peer could send a specially crafted identity string to exploit this flaw.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to be in a position where they can participate in the two-way automatic public key distribution process as a peer.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send an identity string that will be used in the filename on the target system.
