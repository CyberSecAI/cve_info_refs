Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The installer of "Douroshisetu Kihon Data Sakusei System" insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) due to an issue with the DLL search path. This means that the installer, when launched, might load a malicious DLL from the same directory, instead of loading the legitimate one from the appropriate location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **DLL Hijacking/DLL Search Order Hijacking:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure DLL loading mechanism (CWE-427). The application does not specify the full path for DLL loading or uses an insecure search path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack requires placing a malicious DLL file in the same directory as the installer (`setup.exe`).
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must execute the legitimate installer (setup.exe), triggering the vulnerable DLL loading process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the same directory where the installer will be executed.
- The attacker needs to create a malicious DLL file, named so that it would be loaded by the vulnerable application
- The attacker needs to trick the user into running the legitimate installer, while the malicious DLL is present in the same directory

**Additional Details (from the JVN report):**

- **Affected Product:** Douroshisetu Kihon Data Sakusei System Ver1.0.2 and earlier.
- **CVSS Scores:**
    - **CVSS v3:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    - **CVSS v2:** 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
- **Workaround:** The recommended workaround is to ensure that no malicious files exist in the directory where the installer is located before executing it. The provided installer is within an archive in its own directory. It is recommended to not add any files to that directory prior to execution of the installer.
- The vulnerability was reported by Eili Masami of Tachibana Lab.
