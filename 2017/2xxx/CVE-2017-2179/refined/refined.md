Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a remote code execution vulnerability present in the "AppGoat" web application. The application fails to properly sanitize input, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote Code Execution: The core vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Input Sanitization Failure: The application does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input, leading to the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable "AppGoat" instance. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, including data theft, system manipulation, and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network (N): The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- Specially Crafted URL: Exploitation is achieved by sending a specially crafted URL to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must be able to send requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No Authentication Required: No prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability (as per CVSS v3 score).

**CVSS Metrics:**

- **CVSS v3:**
    - AV:N (Network)
    - AC:L (Low)
    - PR:N (None)
    - UI:R (Required) - User interaction is required (likely clicking a malicious link or accessing the crafted URL)
    - S:U (Unchanged)
    - C:L (Low)
    - I:L (Low)
    - A:L (Low)
    - Base Score: 6.3

- **CVSS v2:**
    - AV:N (Network)
    - AC:M (Medium)
    - Au:N (None)
    - C:P (Partial)
    - I:P (Partial)
    - A:P (Partial)
    - Base Score: 6.8
