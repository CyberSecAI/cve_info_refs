- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pipeline: Classpath Step plugin allows a bypass of the Script Security sandbox.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper security measures, allowing users to bypass the Script Security sandbox, which is meant to restrict the execution of untrusted code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows users with SCM commit access or those with permissions such as Job/Configure to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by users with SCM commit access or other Jenkins permissions such as Job/Configure.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have SCM commit access or other Jenkins permissions like Job/Configure.
