```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "CloudForms does not verify that the server hostname matches the domain name in the certificate when using a custom CA and communicating with Red Hat Virtualization (RHEV) and OpenShift.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate certificate validation; Specifically, the hostname verification against the certificate's domain name is missing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could spoof RHEV or OpenShift systems and potentially harvest sensitive information from CloudForms.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepts the communication between CloudForms and RHEV/OpenShift.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between CloudForms and RHEV/OpenShift. The attacker also needs to have the ability to create a fake RHEV/OpenShift server with a certificate that matches CloudForms' custom CA but has a different hostname.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.8 through RHSA-2017:1367."
