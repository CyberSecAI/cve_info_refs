- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of adequate input validation in some Huawei products. This allows an attacker to send malformed packets to the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate input validation, leading to memory leaks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to device memory leaks, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends malformed packets to the targeted device over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
