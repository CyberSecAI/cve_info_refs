Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the kernel when handling shared memory. This occurs because `mach_msg` moves memory to the destination process instead of copying it when using the `deallocate` or `MACH_MSG_VIRTUAL_COPY` flags. However, it fails to account for memory entry objects that could resurrect the moved memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition related to the management of shared memory.
- **Memory Corruption:** The race condition allows for a heap overflow by modifying the size of the shared memory between the time the size is read and when it is used to allocate memory, leading to a buffer overflow on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The provided exploit crashes `diagnosticd` which runs as root.
- **Denial of Service:**  The heap overflow can lead to a crash of the affected application, in this case, `diagnosticd`, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Mach Messages:** The vulnerability is triggered using specially crafted `mach_msg` messages containing shared memory.
- **XPC:** The exploit uses XPC to communicate with a vulnerable service, diagnosticd.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target device, as demonstrated by the exploit PoC.
- **Sandboxed Process:** The vulnerability can be exploited from a sandboxed process.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker must be able to run a malicious application on the target device to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The exploit leverages the `xpc_dictionary_insert` function, which references the shared memory twice. The exploit modifies the size of the shared memory between these two references to create a heap overflow.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability. It involves creating a memory entry, mapping it into the process's address space, crafting a mach message with the memory entry, and racing to modify the shared memory.
- The exploit targets the diagnosticd service, which runs as root, leading to privilege escalation.
- The PoC requires more than 512MB of memory to run, which is used as the shared memory buffer.
- The exploit works by modifying the shared memory size using a race condition to cause the `strcpy` function in `xpc_dictionary_insert` to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap overflow.
