- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the "Rich text" function of the "Memo" application within Cybozu Garoon. It is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on the web browser of a logged-in user. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious scripts into the "Rich text" field of the "Memo" application, which are then stored and executed when other users view the affected memos.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges and be able to post/modify memos. The user would need to interact with the malicious memo (User Interaction: Required).
