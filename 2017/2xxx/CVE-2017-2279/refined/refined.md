- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer of the Tween application has a DLL search path issue, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder where the installer searches for DLLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder. User interaction is required to run the installer.
