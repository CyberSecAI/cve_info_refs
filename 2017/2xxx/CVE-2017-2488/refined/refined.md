- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cryptographic weakness existed in the authentication protocol of Remote Desktop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of an insecure authentication protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker may be able to capture cleartext passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, by intercepting the authentication traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic during the authentication process.
