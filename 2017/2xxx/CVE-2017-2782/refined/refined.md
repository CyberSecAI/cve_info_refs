- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `parseGeneralNames` function when parsing X.509 certificates, specifically within the handling of subject alternative names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Integer underflow in the length counter (`len`).
    - Out-of-bounds read due to a manipulated `activeName->dataLen` leading to `memcpy` reading beyond allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Potential information disclosure by leaking sensitive memory.
    - Denial of service (DoS) due to application crash.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A specially crafted X.509 certificate presented to a vulnerable client or server application during secure connection establishment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to present a crafted X.509 certificate to a vulnerable application. This could involve being a malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker able to alter certificate during handshake.
