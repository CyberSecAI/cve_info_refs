- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of type-length-value (TLV) consistency check in Huawei VRP-based products when processing Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing TLV consistency check when processing EFM packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause EFM flapping by sending crafted malformed packets, leading to denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device. They then send malformed EFM packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable device and the ability to craft malformed network packets.
