Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of directory names in Tablacus Explorer. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize folder names displayed in the address bar, allowing for script injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Script injection vulnerability in how Tablacus Explorer displays folder names, especially when accessed through protocols like FTP.
- Failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input (folder names).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the context of Tablacus Explorer.
- This can lead to the execution of arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the Tablacus Explorer process.
- Potential consequences include unauthorized program installation, data modification or deletion, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can create a malicious folder with a specially crafted name on a server (e.g., FTP server).
- When a user accesses this folder using Tablacus Explorer, the injected script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create or control a directory/folder with a malicious name that a victim would access with Tablacus Explorer.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
- The user needs to initiate the access by navigating to the malicious directory with Tablacus Explorer.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Tablacus Explorer versions 17.3.30 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by Touma Hatano to IPA.
- JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer for remediation.
- The vendor released Tablacus Explorer 17.4.1 to address the issue.
- The advisory also suggests disabling the "Address Bar" add-on or avoid accessing untrusted FTP sites as mitigation.
- CVSS v3 score is 8.8 (High) and CVSS v2 score is 6.8 (Medium)
