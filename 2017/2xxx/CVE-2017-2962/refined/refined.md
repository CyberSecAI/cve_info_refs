Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2962:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the XSLT's `lang` method in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. This lack of validation leads to a type confusion condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Type Confusion: The primary vulnerability is a type confusion, which occurs when the application misinterprets the type of data being processed. This can lead to unexpected behavior, and in this case, allows for arbitrary code execution.
- Lack of input validation: The XSLT's `lang` method does not properly validate user-supplied data, which is a key contributor to the type confusion vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user's Acrobat Reader DC instance). This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that, when opened by a user, triggers the vulnerability.
- Malicious Web Page: An attacker can host a malicious page that, when visited by a user, attempts to exploit the vulnerability in their Adobe Acrobat Reader DC application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious file or direct a victim to a malicious page.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (i.e., the target must open the malicious file or visit the malicious page).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2016-11-30 and a patch was released on 2017-01-05.
- The vulnerability is present in Acrobat Reader DC versions 15.020.20042 and earlier (Continuous track) and 15.006.30244 and earlier (Classic track) and Acrobat XI and Reader XI 11.0.18 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is patched in versions 15.023.20053 (Continuous), 15.006.30279 (Classic) and 11.0.19 (Desktop) respectively.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nicolas Gr√©goire (Agarri).
