Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-2659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Dropbear, when used with GSSAPI, leaking information about whether a given username is valid or invalid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leak: Dropbear reveals if a username exists on the system by incorrectly counting GSSAPI authentication failures against the maximum allowed password attempts. This behavior allows an attacker to enumerate valid usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Username Enumeration: An attacker can potentially determine valid usernames on the target system. This is an information leak that could be used in further attacks (such as brute force attacks) to gain access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: An attacker can probe the system via network access to the Dropbear service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the target system running Dropbear with GSSAPI enabled.
- Ability to attempt SSH connections with arbitrary usernames.
