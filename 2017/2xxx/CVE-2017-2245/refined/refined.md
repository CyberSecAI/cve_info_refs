Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure use of `file_get_contents()` function within the "Shortcodes Ultimate" WordPress plugin, specifically in the `inc/core/tools.php` file. The plugin's "Examples" admin page was using user-supplied input to construct a file path, which was then directly passed to the vulnerable function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability. Attackers can manipulate the input to `file_get_contents()` to access files outside of the intended directory, leading to the potential for reading arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Insecure File Access:** The plugin was directly using user-supplied data without proper validation and sanitization to construct a file path which was then used to read the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read the content of arbitrary local files on the server. This could include sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the WordPress backend, specifically through the `su_example_preview` action.
*   **Manipulated input:** By changing the `code` parameter, attacker can force the server to read files outside the intended plugin directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site. The JVN report specifies a "logged-in user" whereas the plugin changelog indicates it was fixed in the "Examples" admin page. This suggests that the user may require admin level access.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Functionality:** The attacker needs some understanding of how the "Examples" page and its associated AJAX functionality work within the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 4.10.0 of the "Shortcodes Ultimate" plugin.
*   The fix involved removing the direct usage of `file_get_contents()` with user-supplied paths and instead loading the example code via an internal function, `self::get_example_code()`, which limits file access to pre-defined files within the plugin.
* The fix also included a change where the `code` parameter was removed from the request. The example id was used instead.
*   The plugin also fixed an issue in permalink shortcode with an access check.
*   The plugin also added https support for Youtube and Google Maps.
