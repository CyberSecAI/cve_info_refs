Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WP Statistics WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it within the web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's data that are then executed in the browsers of other users when they view pages that utilize this data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the web browser of other users who access the affected pages.
*   This can lead to a variety of malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality that allows for user input to be stored and displayed on the website. Specifically, the vulnerability is in how the plugin handles user-submitted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to input data into a field that the plugin uses to generate output on a page. This typically means having some level of access to the WordPress site itself, or the ability to influence a data source used by the plugin.
*   The user interaction aspect of this vulnerability is that a user needs to visit a page that displays the attacker's injected code for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was present in WP Statistics version 12.0.4 and earlier.
*   The issue was addressed in version 12.0.5.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gen Sato of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. and coordinated through the Information Security Early Warning Partnership.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) and CVSS v2 is 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).
