Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper validation of the node name field within the `pcsd` web UI when creating or importing clusters. Specifically, the application failed to sanitize user-supplied node names before rendering them in the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the node name field. Because the application doesn't sanitize this input, the injected script executes within the user's browser when the cluster information is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated user's session. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Session hijacking by stealing cookies
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the authenticated user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to manipulate the node name field during cluster creation or import using the `pcsd` web UI. This could involve crafting a malicious node name that includes JavaScript code.
*  The attack is considered "reflected" XSS because the malicious script is included as part of the user's request (in the node name), and then reflected back to the user in the server's response

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have some access to the `pcsd` web UI, which could be through a compromised account or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create or import a cluster via the vulnerable UI form.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious input string for the node name field containing javascript code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `pcs` version 0.9.157.
*   The fix involved using `htmlEncode` function to sanitize node names before they are displayed, preventing the browser from executing them as code.
*   The vulnerability was acknowledged and fixed by the ClusterLabs team.
