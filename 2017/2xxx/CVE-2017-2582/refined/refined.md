Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the `StaxParserUtil` class of the Picketlink library, specifically how it parses SAML messages. The parser replaces special strings meant for obtaining attribute values with system properties.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **System Property Exposure**: The vulnerability lies in the ability of the `StaxParserUtil` class to replace special strings within SAML messages with the value of system properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure**: By manipulating the SAML request ID field, an attacker can force the parser to extract and reveal the values of system properties on the target system. The obtained value is accessible in the "InResponseTo" field of the SAML response, enabling the attacker to read any system property that the Java process has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **SAML Message Manipulation**: An attacker manipulates a SAML request, specifically the request ID field, to include special strings that are meant to be replaced by the system property value.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send a SAML request to the affected server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access**: An attacker needs network access to send crafted SAML messages to the vulnerable application server.
-   **SAML Knowledge**: The attacker needs a basic knowledge of SAML structure to manipulate the request ID field to insert special strings pointing to system properties.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability was discovered by Hynek Mlnarik (Red Hat).
-   The vulnerability affects Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform versions 6 and 7 and has been addressed in multiple errata releases: RHSA-2017:2808, RHSA-2017:2809, RHSA-2017:2810, RHSA-2017:2811, RHSA-2017:3216, RHSA-2017:3217, RHSA-2017:3218, RHSA-2017:3219, RHSA-2017:3220, RHSA-2018:2740, RHSA-2018:2741, RHSA-2018:2742, RHSA-2018:2743, RHSA-2019:0136, RHSA-2019:0137 and RHSA-2019:0139.
-   The fix for this CVE may break the ability to replace attributes with system properties. This issue is tracked by bug 1594389.
