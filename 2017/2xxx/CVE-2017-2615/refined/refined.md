Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2615:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds access issue exists in the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator within QEMU. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during bit block transfer (bitblt) operations when copying VGA data in backward mode. The blit width was not correctly handled when moving backwards through video RAM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** The code failed to properly calculate memory offsets during backward bitblt operations, leading to reads/writes beyond the allocated buffer for the VGA memory.
- **Improper calculation:** The width parameter was not negated in backward copy mode which resulted in incorrect address calculation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service for the affected virtual machine.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker might be able to use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the host system with the privileges of the QEMU process.
- **Information disclosure** Out of bounds read could lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Guest Privileges:**  The vulnerability is triggered by a privileged user *within* a guest operating system.
- **Cirrus VGA Emulation:** The vulnerability is specific to systems using the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulation. It does not affect guests with "stdvga" emulated video cards.
- **Bitblt Copy Operations:** The flaw is exposed when performing bitblt copy operations in backward mode on the Cirrus VGA emulator.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Privileged access within a guest:** The attacker needs to have administrator or root privileges inside a virtual machine to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to control graphics operations:** The attacker must be able to influence the graphics operations performed by the guest operating system to trigger the vulnerable code path within QEMU.
