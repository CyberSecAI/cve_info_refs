| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1425746#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-22 09:56:17 UTC  ``` A coding mistake was found in TLS Certificate Status Request extension feature that asks for a fresh proof of the server's certificate's validity in the code that checks for a test success or failure. It ends up always thinking there's valid proof, even when there is none or if the server doesn't support the TLS extension in question. Contrary to how it used to function and contrary to how this feature is documented to work.  This could lead to users not detecting when a server's certificate goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better shape than it is in reality. This flaw also exists in the command line tool (--cert-status).  Affected versions: 7.52.0 to and including 7.52.1 Not affected versions: < 7.52.0 and >= 7.53.0  Upstream patch:  <https://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2017-2629.patch>  External References:  <https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170222.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1425746#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-22 09:58:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Curl project Upstream: Marcus Hoffmann   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1425746#c2)  Kamil Dudka    2017-02-22 15:33:01 UTC  ``` Luckily, this bug has never reached any stable release of Fedora.  Rawhide is fixed since curl-7.53.0-1.fc26 via:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/curl.git/commit/?id=8afeb939>   ``` |  |

# cURL: Certificate validation error — GLSA **201703-04**

A coding error has been found in cURL, causing the TLS Certificate
Status Request extension check to always return true.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/curl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.53.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.53.0** |

### Background

cURL is a tool and libcurl is a library for transferring data with URL
syntax.

### Description

cURL and applications linked against libcurl support “OCSP
stapling”, also known as the TLS Certificate Status Request extension
(using the CURLOPT\_SSL\_VERIFYSTATUS option). When telling cURL to use
this feature, it uses that TLS extension to ask for a fresh proof of the
server’s certificate’s validity. If the server doesn’t support the
extension, or fails to provide said proof, cURL is expected to return an
error.
Due to a coding mistake, the code that checks for a test success or
failure, ends up always thinking there’s valid proof, even when there
is none or if the server doesn’t support the TLS extension in question.

### Impact

Due to the error, a user maybe does not detect when a server’s
certificate goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a
better shape than it is in reality.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.53.0"

```

# [R1] LCE 5.0.1 Fixes Two Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Log Correlation Engine (LCE) 5.0.0 is impacted by multiple vulnerabilities reported in a third-party library and an encryption algorithm. LCE was errantly using 3DES on TCP port 1243.

The following vulnerabilities have been resolved with the updated libraries.

* cURL / libcurl lib/url.c allocate\_conn() Function OCSP Stapling Validation Failure MitM Certificate Revocation Bypass [CVE-2017-2629]
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32) [CVE-2016-2183]

Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that LCE be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Log Correlation Engine (LCE) 5.0.1 has been released, which updates the linked cURL library and disabled 3DES. The new version [can be obtained on the Tenable Support Portal](https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=180).

#### Description

curl before 7.53.0 has an incorrect TLS Certificate Status Request extension feature that asks for a fresh proof of the server's certificate's validity in the code that checks for a test success or failure. It ends up always thinking there's valid proof, even when there is none or if the server doesn't support the TLS extension in question. This could lead to users not detecting when a server's certificate goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better shape than it is in reality. This flaw also exists in the command line tool (--cert-status).

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Garcia    2002-02-08 14:58:12 UTC  ``` i would recommend that you require imlib with icewm and add the --with-imlib to icewm configure it makes for a better icewm that supports more than just xpm ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-08 23:42:34 UTC  ``` OK, fixed in a new rev on CVS.  The icewm ebuild still isn't great, but is improving. ``` |  |

#### Description

The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.
