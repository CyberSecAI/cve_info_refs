{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A coding mistake in the TLS Certificate Status Request extension feature within curl/libcurl.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code incorrectly checks for the success or failure of a TLS Certificate Status Request, always returning a positive result even when the server does not support the extension or when proof of validity is not provided."
    ],
    "impact": "Users may not detect when a server's certificate becomes invalid, leading to a false sense of security. An attacker may be able to bypass revocation checks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks could exploit this flaw by presenting an invalid certificate, while the client using the vulnerable curl version will not detect the issue."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be positioned in a network to perform a MitM attack. Additionally, the attacker needs a server which is configured to use the TLS Certificate Status Request extension."

  "affected_versions": [
    "curl versions 7.52.0 to 7.52.1 inclusive"
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "curl version 7.53.0 and later"
