### TALOS-2017-0293

## WolfSSL library X509 Certificate Text Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability

##### May 4, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2800

### Summary

An exploitable off-by-one write vulnerability exists in the x509 certificate parsing functionality of wolfSSL library versions up to 3.10.2. A specially crafted x509 certificate can cause a single out of bounds byte overwrite resulting in potential certificate validation vulnerabilities, denial of service and possible remote code execution. In order to trigger this vulnerability, the attacker needs to supply a malicious x509 certificate to either server or client application using this library.

### Tested Versions

WolfSSL 3.10.2

### Product URLs

<https://www.wolfssl.com>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-193: Off-by-one Error

### Details

WolfSSL, previously CyaSSL, is a lightweight SSL/TLS library targeted for embedded and RTOS environments, primarily because of its small size, speed, portability, and feature set. According to the vendor it is used in wide range of products including industrial control systems, IoT devices, VoIP hardware, routers and more.

The vulnerability exists in x509 code that deals with string fields in DER certificates. Specifically, when parsing `commonName`, `countryName`, `localityName`, `stateName`, `orgName` or `orgUnit` fields, the function `wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID` is used. Its prototype is:

```
int wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID(WOLFSSL_X509_NAME* name, int nid, char* buf, int len);

```

Its task is to copy the appropriate string from `name` context into supplied `buf` of length `len`. The issue happens when the string is longer or equal to length of the allocated buffer. Following code highlights the issue for the case of `commonName` field:

```
		int wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID(WOLFSSL_X509_NAME* name,
																			int nid, char* buf, int len)
{
		char *text = NULL;
		int textSz = 0;

		WOLFSSL_ENTER("wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID");

		switch (nid) {
				case ASN_COMMON_NAME:
						text = name->fullName.fullName + name->fullName.cnIdx;        [1]
						textSz = name->fullName.cnLen;                                [2]
						break;
...

				if (buf != NULL && text != NULL) {
				textSz = min(textSz, len);                                        [3]
				XMEMCPY(buf, text, textSz);                                        [4]
				buf[textSz] = '\0';                                                [5]
		}

```

At [1] and [2], `text` and `textSz` are initialized. At [3] the lesser of the two values `textSz` and `len` is chosen. This value ends up as the size parameter to a `memcpy` call at [4]. Then, the same value is used as an index to NULL terminate the string at [5]. If the string length is bigger than size of the allocated buffer, NULL termination at index `textSz` will cause an off-by-one NULL byte write into adjacent memory variable on the stack or heap, depending on where the buffer was allocated.

Depending on the way the library is used, this could lead to further issues when doing certificate validation or potentially result in remote code execution.

The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying the attached PoC x509 certificate to the `certfileds` example app from wolfssl-examples.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
