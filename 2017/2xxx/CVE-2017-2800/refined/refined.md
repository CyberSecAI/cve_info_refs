Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- An off-by-one write vulnerability exists in the `wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID` function within the wolfSSL library when parsing X.509 certificate string fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The function copies strings from the certificate into a buffer.
- If the string from the certificate is equal to or longer than the allocated buffer, a null termination character is written out of bounds, overwriting a single byte in adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential certificate validation bypass.
- Denial of Service (DoS).
- Possible remote code execution (depending on how the library is used and what memory is overwritten).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must supply a specially crafted X.509 certificate.
- The vulnerable code is triggered when parsing fields like `commonName`, `countryName`, `localityName`, `stateName`, `orgName`, or `orgUnit`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious certificate to either a client or server application using the vulnerable wolfSSL library.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in wolfSSL library versions up to 3.10.2.
- The vulnerability is located in `wolfssl/src/ssl.c`
- The `wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID` function is used to extract string data from X509 certificates, and a faulty null termination can overwrite other data.
- A PoC X.509 certificate can be generated using OpenSSL.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.
- The issue was assigned the CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error).
- The CVSSv3 score is 8.1, with vectors: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
