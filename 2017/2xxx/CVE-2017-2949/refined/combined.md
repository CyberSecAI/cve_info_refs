## Adobe Reader DC XSLT variable Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-17-007ZDI-CAN-4189

| CVE ID | [CVE-2017-2949](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-2949) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Acrobat Reader DC](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['25828']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within XSLT's variable. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within XSLT's processing-instruction. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.
