Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-2363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `FrameLoader::clear` function in WebKit. When a new page is loading, this function is called to clear the old document and window. The issue arises from the order of operations within the `clear` function. The new document's window is attached before the old document is detached. This timing allows JavaScript code within the unload event handler of the old document to execute with the new document's window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability enables Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) because the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a different origin.
*   **Incorrect Object Lifetime Management:** The core issue is related to how WebKit handles the lifetime of document and window objects during page transitions, creating a window of opportunity to exploit the state transition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the new document's window.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Because the injected JavaScript runs with the privileges of the new document's origin, it can potentially be used to access sensitive data and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a website with a crafted iframe and javascript to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Targeted Injection:**  An attacker could use another vulnerability to inject the malicious code into the victim's page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker must be able to serve a malicious HTML page with a crafted iframe.
*   **User Interaction:** A user needs to load the malicious page in a vulnerable browser, though this might be done via social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit described on exploit-db shows a way to chain iframe onload and onunload events to ultimately trigger the javascript execution.
*   The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on Safari 10.0.2(12602.3.12.0.1).
*   Apple's security advisory indicates that this vulnerability is addressed in Safari 10.0.3 and other updates for macOS, iOS, and watchOS
*   The vulnerability was discovered by lokihardt of Google Project Zero.

**Summary of Apple's fix**
The Apple advisories state that the issue is fixed through "improved logic" in handling page loading. This likely addresses the timing issue within the `FrameLoader::clear` function to prevent the execution of javascript in the unload handler from having access to the new document.
