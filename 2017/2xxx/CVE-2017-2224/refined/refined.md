Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The WordPress plugin "Event Calendar WD" had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin did not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]: The plugin was vulnerable to stored XSS, where an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be stored in the database and executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking/theft of cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user (if they have necessary rights).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The vulnerability involves user interaction (UI:R), meaning a user needs to interact with the malicious content, typically by visiting a page where the malicious script is executed.
- The vulnerability exists in the way the plugin processes and displays user-supplied input. It was discovered that the plugin failed to sanitize taxonomy options, date fields, and other user inputs before displaying them. This is particularly evident in the modifications made in the `ecwd-cpt-filter.php` file where `sanitize_text_field()` was introduced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) to inject malicious script.
- The attacker needs the ability to insert data into vulnerable fields of the plugin (e.g., by manipulating query parameters, or leveraging other vulnerabilities to insert data).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Chris Liu to IPA.
- The vulnerable plugin version was prior to 1.0.94.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.0.94. The fix involves sanitizing user inputs using functions such as `sanitize_text_field()` and `htmlentities()` before they are displayed in HTML.
- The plugin was closed as of June 13, 2022, due to this security issue.
- CVSS v3 score is 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
- CVSS v2 score is 2.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).
