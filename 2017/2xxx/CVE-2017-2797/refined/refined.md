The content is related to CVE-2017-2797.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ParseEnvironment` function of the AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter, specifically within the `DMC_2OLEreadStream` function call. The size of the buffer allocated and the size used for copying data are inconsistent, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the `ParseEnvironment` function.
- Inconsistent sizes used for memory allocation and data copy operations, specifically when handling different atom types (`textMasterStyleAtom` and `fontEntityAtom`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted PPT file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide or send a malicious PPT file to a system using the vulnerable software (AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter as used by MarkLogic 8.0-6).
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, but user interaction is needed (opening the malicious PPT file).
