**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve or inject malicious web content that targets the vulnerable WebKit implementation.
- No specific privileged access is required; the attack can be performed on a user viewing the malicious content within a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed through improved input validation in element handling.
- The vulnerability was present in the WebKit component of the following:
    - tvOS 10.2
    - Safari 10.1
    - iTunes 12.6 for Windows
    - iOS 10.3
    - iCloud for Windows 6.2

The provided exploit-db entry further clarifies the issue. The vulnerability is triggered by a focus event fired when removing a link element, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript execution that can create an iframe with no parent and trigger the XSS payload. The vulnerability is related to how the browser delays focus events when stylesheets are not fully loaded, and how removing a link element may improperly trigger the focus event.
