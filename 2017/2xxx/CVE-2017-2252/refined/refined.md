The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2252.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The self-extracting archive files created by File Compact have a vulnerability related to the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries. This is due to an issue with how the software searches for and loads required DLL files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)). The vulnerability lies in the way the self-extracting archive searches for and loads DLL files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking a vulnerable self-extracting archive file. If an attacker can place a malicious DLL in the same directory as a vulnerable self-extracting archive, they could potentially execute arbitrary code when the user runs the archive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable self-extracting archive file.
- The victim needs to execute the self-extracting archive file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory where the vulnerable self-extracting archive file resides.
- The user must then be tricked into executing the self-extracting archive file.
