- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the PDF parsing functionality of Lexmark Perceptive Document Filters. The vulnerability stems from the way the software handles `GfxFont` objects within the modified Xpdf/Poppler library, specifically during the processing of PostScript tags. A `GfxFont` object is freed but then later accessed, leading to a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. By controlling the heap layout, an attacker can cause the program to jump to an attacker-controlled address.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted PDF document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF document to the vulnerable software.
