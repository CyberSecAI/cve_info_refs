- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in the JPEG 2000 parser when calculating buffer size based on the `xTsiz` value from the file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer overflow leading to small memory allocation for a seemingly large tile.
    - Controlled out-of-bounds write due to the discrepancy in buffer size vs the amount of data being written
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the application due to the controlled out-of-bounds write.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Viewing a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image in IrfanView.
    - Using the thumbnailing feature of IrfanView with a malicious image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to craft a malicious JPEG 2000 image with a specific `xTsiz` value.
    - The user needs to open or thumbnail the malicious image using IrfanView.
