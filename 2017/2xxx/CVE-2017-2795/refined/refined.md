- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap buffer overflow exists in the `Txo` function of AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter when converting an XLS file to HTML. The size of the buffer allocated is smaller than the size of the data being copied into it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap buffer overflow due to inconsistent size calculation when processing `Txo` and `Continue` records from an XLS file. The allocated buffer size is read from a `Txo` record while the memcpy size is read from a `Continue` record. Lack of proper bounds checking before the `memcpy` operation allows writing beyond the allocated buffer, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted XLS file. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious XLS file to the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XLS file to a system utilizing the vulnerable AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter software. No special privileges are needed.
