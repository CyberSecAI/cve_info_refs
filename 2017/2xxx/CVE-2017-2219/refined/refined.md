- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The [Simeji for Windows(Î²)] installer has a DLL search path issue, which can cause it to load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) insecurely.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder where the installer will search for DLLs, and then have a user execute the installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL in a specific folder. The user must also execute the vulnerable installer.
