The provided content is related to CVE-2017-2255.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the "Rich text" function of the "Space" application within Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a logged-in user. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, or defacement of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker injects malicious script into the "Rich text" field of the Space application. This script is then stored and executed when a user views the content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to use the "Rich text" function in the Space application (i.e. needs "PR:L" which is low privilege). The attacker also needs to trick the victim into viewing the page containing the malicious script ("UI:R" which requires user interaction).
