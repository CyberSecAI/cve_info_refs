# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0402

## Cesanta Mongoose MQTT SUBSCRIBE Topic Length Information Leak

##### October 31, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2895

### Summary

An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of=bounds memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Cesanta Mongoose 6.8

### Product URLs

<https://cesanta.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

### Details

Mongoose is a monolithic library implementing a number of networking protocols, including HTTP, MQTT, MDNS and others. It is designed with embedded devices in mind and as such is used in many IoT devices and runs on virtually all platforms.

While parsing an MQTT packet SUBSCRIBE command, topic string size as encoded in the packet is trusted without any additional validation. This arbitrary length value is used in pointer arithmetic and can cause out-of-bounds memory access. The vulnerability occurs in function `mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic`:

```
int mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic(struct mg_mqtt_message *msg,
                              struct mg_str *topic, uint8_t *qos, int pos) {
 unsigned char *buf = (unsigned char *) msg->payload.p + pos;

 if ((size_t) pos >= msg->payload.len) {
 return -1;

 topic->len = buf[0] << 8 | buf[1];         [1]
 topic->p = (char *) buf + 2;
 *qos = buf[2 + topic->len];                [2]
 return pos + 2 + topic->len + 1;

```

In the above code, at [1] two bytes from message buffer are read as `topic->len` and then immediatelly used at [2] to calculate offset to `qos`. No check is performed to insure it would be inside the bounds of the buffer which is limited in size. This issue can be triggered multiple times and with careful control of the memory layout could be abused to leak memory and cause denial of service.

The vulnerability can be triggered by sending the supplied proof of concept packet to the sample `mqtt_broker` application supplied with the library.
