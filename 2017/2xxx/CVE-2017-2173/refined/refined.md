Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within Empirical Project Monitor - eXtended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser when they interact with the vulnerable application. This can lead to:
  - Confidentiality Impact: Low (CVSS v3) - An attacker might be able to access sensitive information within the context of the victim's session.
  - Integrity Impact: Low (CVSS v3) - An attacker could modify content or actions on the website within the context of the victim's session.
  - Availability Impact: None (CVSS v3) - This specific vulnerability doesn't directly affect the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (N):** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** An attacker needs low-level privileges or a user account on the vulnerable application.
- **User Interaction Required (UI:R):**  The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with a malicious link or content to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vendor (IPA) has discontinued development and support for the affected software and recommends users to stop using it.
- The vulnerability was reported by Toshitsugu Yoneyama of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
- The vulnerability is distinct from JVN#11326581.
- The provided sources offer detailed CVSS v3 and v2 metrics, further quantifying the severity of this vulnerability.
