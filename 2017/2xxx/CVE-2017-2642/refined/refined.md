- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some pages display full names of users as part of the permission error message, even for users who lack the capability to view full names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. The system reveals user full names to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unauthorized disclosure of user full names.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing pages that generate permission error messages. The vulnerability is triggered by accessing specific pages that reveal user information as part of an error message when the user lacks the appropriate permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a user of the system and have the ability to access pages or trigger actions that cause permission errors. The attacker does not need administrative privileges, only the ability to interact with the system in a way that triggers the vulnerability.
