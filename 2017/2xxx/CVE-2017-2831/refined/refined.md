- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `CGIProxy.fcgi` service in Foscam IP cameras contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP GET requests. Specifically, the service copies the query string into a fixed-size buffer and then appends additional strings without proper size validation, leading to an overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Classic buffer overflow (CWE-120).
    - Lack of input validation on the length of the query string.
    - Unsafe string concatenation (`strcat`) operations that don't account for the buffer's limited size.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The buffer overflow allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary data. This could lead to a variety of consequences such as denial of service, arbitrary code execution or other malicious impacts. The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the stack and registers.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the device's `CGIProxy.fcgi` service. The request's query string needs to be crafted to overflow the buffer.
    - The attack vector is network based, requiring no prior authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Foscam IP camera.
    - No specific user privileges or authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs to know the device's IP address to target it.
