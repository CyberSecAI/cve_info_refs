{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation used the IPv4-only inet_sk_rebuild_header() function for both IPv4 and IPv6 DCCP connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect function used for IPv6 DCCP connections",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a DCCP reset packet over IPv6.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a system with an IPv6 address routable, and be able to initiate a DCCP connection to a listening server."

  "additional_notes": "The fix is to use the AF-independent rebuild_header routine instead of the IPv4-only inet_sk_rebuild_header(). The DCCP kernel module is also blacklisted at load time to reduce further exposure to additional issues."
