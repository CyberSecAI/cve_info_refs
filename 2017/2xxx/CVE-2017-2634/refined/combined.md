| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1424751#c0)  Wade Mealing    2017-02-19 07:27:01 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the linux kernels implementation of DCCP protocol in which a an application making a DCCP connection over IPV6 could crash a remote (or local) system.  When attempting to send a DCCP reset packet, the system will incorrectly create the packet header and while updating the SNMP counters for this condition crash the kernel. The remote system would need to have both an application running as a DCCP server and have an IPV6 address routable.  This can result in the system crash or denial of service.  Upstream fix:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=f53dc67c5e7babafe239b93a11678b0e05bead51>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1424751#c13)  Wade Mealing    2017-02-24 04:21:55 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1424753](show_bug.cgi?id=1424753) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1424751#c14)  Wade Mealing    2017-02-24 04:44:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 kernel.  This issue was fixed in a versions 6 and 7 prior to this issue being raised.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1424751#c0)  Wade Mealing    2017-02-19 07:27:01 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the linux kernels implementation of DCCP protocol in which a an application making a DCCP connection over IPV6 could crash a remote (or local) system.  When attempting to send a DCCP reset packet, the system will incorrectly create the packet header and while updating the SNMP counters for this condition crash the kernel. The remote system would need to have both an application running as a DCCP server and have an IPV6 address routable.  This can result in the system crash or denial of service.  Upstream fix:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=f53dc67c5e7babafe239b93a11678b0e05bead51>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1424751#c13)  Wade Mealing    2017-02-24 04:21:55 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1424753](show_bug.cgi?id=1424753) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1424751#c14)  Wade Mealing    2017-02-24 04:44:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 kernel.

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Long
Life.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating
system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Datagram

Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation freed SKB (socket buffer)
resources for a DCCP\_PKT\_REQUEST packet when the IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO option is set
on the socket. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to alter the
kernel memory, allowing them to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2017-6074, Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol

(DCCP) implementation used the IPv4-only inet\_sk\_rebuild\_header() function for
both IPv4 and IPv6 DCCP connections, which could result in memory corruptions. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2017-2634,
Moderate)

Important: This update disables the DCCP kernel module at load time by using the
kernel module blacklist method. The module is disabled in an attempt to reduce
further exposure to additional issues. (BZ#1426309)

Red Hat would like to thank Andrey Konovalov (Google) for reporting
CVE-2017-6074. The CVE-2017-2634 issue was discovered by Wade Mealing (Red Hat
Product Security).

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in
this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0347)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long
Life.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating
system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Datagram

Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation freed SKB (socket buffer)
resources for a DCCP\_PKT\_REQUEST packet when the IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO option is set
on the socket. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to alter the
kernel memory, allowing them to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2017-6074, Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol

(DCCP) implementation used the IPv4-only inet\_sk\_rebuild\_header() function for
both IPv4 and IPv6 DCCP connections, which could result in memory corruptions. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2017-2634,
Moderate)

Important: This update disables the DCCP kernel module at load time by using the
kernel module blacklist method. The module is disabled in an attempt to reduce
further exposure to additional issues. (BZ#1426311)

Red Hat would like to thank Andrey Konovalov (Google) for reporting
CVE-2017-6074. The CVE-2017-2634 issue was discovered by Wade Mealing (Red Hat
Product Security).

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in
this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

[DCCP]: Use AF-independent rebuild\_header routineThis fixes a nasty bug: dccp\_send\_reset() is called by both DCCPv4 and DCCPv6, but uses
inet\_sk\_rebuild\_header() in each case. This leads to unpredictable and weird behaviour:
under some conditions, DCCPv6 Resets were sent, in other not.
The fix is to use the AF-independent rebuild\_header routine.

* Resolve

Red Hat Product Security has been made aware of a vulnerability in the Linux kernel that has been assigned  [CVE-2016-5195.](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5195)  This issue was publicly disclosed on **October 19, 2016** and has been rated as  [Important.](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/#Important)  This issue is being refered to as "Dirty COW" in the media.

## Background Information

A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system.

This could be abused by an attacker to modify existing setuid files with instructions to elevate privileges. An exploit using this technique has been found in the wild. This flaw affects most modern Linux distributions.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of  [Important.](http://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/)

## Impacted Products

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2
* Red Hat Openshift Online v2
* Red Hat Virtualization (RHEV-H/RHV-H)

## Attack Description and Impact

This flaw allows an attacker with a local system account to modify on-disk binaries, bypassing the standard permission mechanisms that would prevent modification without an appropriate permission set. This is achieved by racing the madvise(MADV\_DONTNEED) system call while having the page of the executable mmapped in memory.

## Diagnose your vulnerability

### Determine if your system is vulnerable

[Download Detection Script](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/rh-cve-2016-5195_5.sh)

## Take Action

All Red Hat customers running the affected versions of the kernel are strongly recommended to update the kernel as soon as patches are available. Details about impacted packages as well as recommended mitigation are noted below. A system reboot is required in order for the kernel update to be applied.

## Updates for Affected Products

The fixes for CVE-2016-5195 were included in the recent release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3.

A **kpatch** for customers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 or greater will be available. Please open a support case to gain access to the kpatch.

### **Mitigation**

Red Hat Support supplies mitigations like SystemTap scripts as a stop-gap until official patches are released.  SystemTap scripts are only supported for 30 days after the GA release of the final patches.

**HOW TO BUILD AND USE THE SYSTEMTAP WORKAROUND**

The systemtap countermeasure involves creating a kernel module (like a driver) using a systemtap script that intercepts the vulnerable system call. It is used as a stopgap solution until a fixed kernel is booted into the affected machine. This solution does not require a reboot and applies to RHEL 5, 6 and 7.

It is not possible to make a module that applies to all kernels. Not even for a family (i.e., All RHEL5, 6 or 7). Each specific kernel version requires a .ko generated for that given kernel (uname -r).

**REQUIREMENTS**

In order to build the systemtap module, the following packages are required:

* systemtap-client
* systemtap-devel
* gcc (and dependencies)
* kernel-devel-`uname -r`
* kernel-debuginfo-`uname -r`
* kernel-debuginfo-common-`uname -r`

WARNING: The 'kernel' packages requires the same version as the running kernel. Downloading the latest version will prevent systemtap for working. Please download the exact running version.

**WHERE DO I GET THE DEBUGINFOS**

Please refer to KB <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/9907>

**HOW DO I BUILD THE MODULE**

1. After you installed the packages, create a file named dirtycow.stp with this content:

> > ```
> > probe kernel.function("mem_write").call ? {
> >         $count = 0
> > }
> >
> > probe syscall.ptrace {  // includes compat ptrace as well
> >         $request = 0xfff
> > }
> >
> > probe begin {
> >         printk(0, "CVE-2016-5195 mitigation loaded")
> > }
> >
> >
> > probe end {
> >         printk(0, "CVE-2016-5195 mitigation unloaded")
> > }
> >
> > ```

2. Save the file. Compile it using this command:

> > ```
> > # stap -g -p 4 -m dirtycow_`uname -r|tr -cd [:digit:]` dirtycow.stp
> > dirtycow_26183985.ko
> >
> > ```

In the above example, the .ko file has a number identifying its kernel version. In that case, it is 2.6.18-398.el5. This module can be used in other systems with this exact kernel version without having to install the debuginfo and development packages, needing only systemtap-runtime . Just copy the module file to the server with the same kernel version, install the systemtap-runtime package and proceed from the next step.

3. In order to load the module, run the command staprun -L <.ko file>. For example:

> > ```
> > # staprun -L dirtycow_26183985.ko
> >
> > ```

4. Check if is it loaded:

> > ```
> > # dmesg | grep CVE-2016-5195
> > CVE-2016-5195 mitigation loaded
> >
> > ```

5. To unload the module, reboot the system or run the "staprun -A dirtycow\_26183985" command and interrupt it with Ctlr+C, as shown below:

> > ```

**IMPORTANT**

* The module does not survive a boot: It is not reloaded after a system boot.
* After a reboot, the module must be manually loaded again.
* If the kernel is updated or changed, this module won't be loaded into the new kernel.
* If you booted into a different kernel without the fix, a new compatible module should be loaded.
* A corrected kernel does not need the module load.

Please reference bug  [1384344](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1384344#c13)  for detailed mitigation steps.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0323)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating
system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Datagram

Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation freed SKB (socket buffer)
resources for a DCCP\_PKT\_REQUEST packet when the IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO option is set
on the socket. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to alter the
kernel memory, allowing them to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2017-6074, Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol

(DCCP) implementation used the IPv4-only inet\_sk\_rebuild\_header() function for
both IPv4 and IPv6 DCCP connections, which could result in memory corruptions. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2017-2634,
Moderate)

Important: This update disables the DCCP kernel module at load time by using the
kernel module blacklist method. The module is disabled in an attempt to reduce
further exposure to additional issues. Please see Red Hat Bugzilla (BZ#1425177)
for additional information.

Red Hat would like to thank Andrey Konovalov (Google) for reporting
CVE-2017-6074. The CVE-2017-2634 issue was discovered by Wade Mealing (Red Hat
Product Security).

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in
this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
