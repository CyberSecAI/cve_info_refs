  "cve": "CVE-2017-2602",
  "description": "The Pipeline suite of plugins stored build metadata in the file `program.dat` and the directory `workflow/`. These were not excluded in the agent-to-controller security subsystem and could therefore be written to by malicious agents.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Pipeline build metadata files were not blacklisted in the agent-to-master security subsystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient file access restrictions",
       "Missing blacklist for sensitive metadata files"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious agents could write to Pipeline build metadata files (`program.dat` and `workflow/`), potentially leading to data corruption or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Compromised Jenkins agent"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a Jenkins agent connected to the Jenkins controller."
  },
   "affected_versions": [
    "All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 2.43",
    "All Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 2.32.1"
    ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "Jenkins main line users should update to 2.44",
