**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an HTTP header injection issue in multiple I-O DATA network camera products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Header Injection (CWE-113):** The web interface of the affected network cameras is susceptible to HTTP header injection, also known as HTTP response splitting. This likely involves improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input used in constructing HTTP response headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Forged Information Display:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the display of forged or manipulated content within the web browser of a logged-in user. This means an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript that will be executed in the context of the user's session with the camera's web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). This means the attacker can be remote.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) meaning that a user needs to be logged into the web interface of the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the device (PR:N) but requires the ability to send malicious requests to the camera, and some method to trick a user into visiting a malicious link or be performing a man-in-the-middle attack..

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.7 and a CVSS v2 base score of 2.6.
- The provided content also lists CVE-2017-2112 (OS command injection) and CVE-2017-2113 (Buffer Overflow), but these are separate vulnerabilities.
