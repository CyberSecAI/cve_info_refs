- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `DHFSummary` function of AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter. The vulnerability occurs due to a `memcpy` operation where the size parameter is read from a PPT file and not properly validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow: The `memcpy` copies data to a stack buffer without properly checking the size, which can lead to overwriting return addresses and other stack data.
    - Integer overflow leading to bypass of size check: The size is read as a signed integer. Values greater than 0x7FFFFFFF will cause a negative value during the size check, bypassing the size limit of 1026.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution due to stack corruption, allowing an attacker to gain control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending or providing a specially crafted PPT file to the vulnerable application (AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PPT file to the system running the vulnerable software (MarkLogic with the vulnerable AntennaHouse component). No special privileges or access within the vulnerable system are required to trigger the vulnerability.
