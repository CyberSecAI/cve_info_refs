Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-2620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an out-of-bounds access issue in the `cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo` function within the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator of QEMU. This function is responsible for copying data from the CPU to video memory during bit block transfers (bitblt). The vulnerability arises because the function does not properly check if the specified memory region for copying is valid/safe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Access:** The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking in `cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo` when handling `CIRRUS_BLTMODE_MEMSYSSRC` mode transfers. This allows the function to access memory outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged user inside a guest operating system can exploit the flaw to crash the QEMU process by triggering the out-of-bounds access. This could lead to a denial of service for the entire virtual machine running on the host system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** More severely, an attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the host system with the privileges of the QEMU process. This allows for guest-to-host privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a privileged user inside a virtual machine (guest).
*   The guest must be configured to use the vulnerable "cirrus" VGA emulation.
*   The guest user needs to craft a specific sequence of bitblt operations to trigger the out-of-bounds access in `cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a privileged user (e.g., root) within the guest operating system.
*   The attacker must have the ability to interact with the virtualized VGA adapter to initiate the vulnerable bitblt operations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of QEMU and is present in both the upstream QEMU and Red Hat-specific (qemu-kvm-rhev) builds.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by patching the `cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo` function, specifically to add `blit_is_unsafe` check.
