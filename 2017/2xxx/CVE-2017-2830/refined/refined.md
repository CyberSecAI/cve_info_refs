The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for CVE-2017-2830.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the web management interface of Foscam IP cameras due to insufficient boundary checking when processing multipart/form-data requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Lack of input validation when handling the "boundary" string in multipart/form-data requests within the CGIProxy.fcgi service.
- The boundary string from the HTTP request is copied into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without verifying its length.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution by overwriting data on the stack, including the saved link register (return address).
- The overflow can lead to control flow hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with a multipart/form-data content type to the `CGIProxy.fcgi` service.
- The crafted request includes an overly long boundary string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Foscam IP camera.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device.
- Knowledge of the camera's web interface is required to formulate the request and target the vulnerable `usrBeatHeart` command.
- A valid username and password are required. However, default credentials could be used in some instances.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `snapPicHandler` function, specifically when processing POST requests with multipart/form-data content types.
- The `sub_935C` function parses the content-type and boundary, and a strcpy call copies the boundary string to a stack buffer.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a request to the endpoint `/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi` with the command `usrBeatHeart`.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to craft a malicious request using Perl and `curl`.
- The report lists specific firmware versions affected:
    - System Firmware Version: 1.9.3.17
    - Application Firmware Version: 2.52.2.37
    - Web Version: 2.0.1.1
