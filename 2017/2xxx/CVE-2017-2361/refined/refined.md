Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the way macOS Help Viewer handles URLs and the `x-help-script` protocol. Specifically, HelpViewer incorrectly validates the path of URLs, allowing a bypass using double-encoded "../". This allows arbitrary local files to be accessed, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the lack of proper input validation of URLs provided to HelpViewer.
*   **Insecure Protocol Handler:** HelpViewer's internal `x-help-script` protocol handler allows opening arbitrary local files.
*   **Path Traversal Bypass:** Double-encoded "../" sequences bypass the application's URL path validation, allowing access to files outside of the intended help directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The XSS allows reading arbitrary local files using XMLHttpRequest.
*   **Application takeover:** As shown in the proof of concept, the attacker could open arbitrary applications such as Calculator.app

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** The attack can be triggered by tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted `help:` URL.
*   **Web Content:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious website or HTML file loaded through the HelpViewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft a Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL with the double-encoded path traversal and JavaScript payload.
*   **User Interaction (Social Engineering):** The attacker needs the victim to open a malicious link or web content in HelpViewer.
*   **Local System Access:** While the attack is initiated remotely, the goal is to achieve local code execution on the user's machine.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code uses a double-encoded `../` to bypass path validation.
*   The exploit leverages the `x-help-script` protocol to execute an AppleScript that opens the Calculator application as proof of concept.
*   The vulnerability was tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2659).
*   The fix is included in macOS Sierra 10.12.3, which addresses the cross-site scripting issue through improved URL validation.
*   The exploit was discovered by lokihardt of Google Project Zero.
