Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2611:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stemmed from the lack of permission checks on the `/workspaceCleanup` and `/fingerprintCleanup` URLs in Jenkins. These URLs triggered background processes for cleaning up workspaces and fingerprints, respectively.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Permission Check:** The primary weakness was the absence of proper permission checks on the mentioned URLs. This allowed unauthorized users to initiate resource-intensive background processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a DoS condition on the Jenkins controller and agents by triggering unnecessary workspace and fingerprint cleanups. This could cause additional load on the system and potentially disrupt its normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack could be carried out by any user with network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers could directly access the vulnerable URLs (`/workspaceCleanup` and `/fingerprintCleanup`) via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Read Access:** The attacker only required "read" access to the Jenkins instance. This implies the user was not necessarily an administrator or a privileged user.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to the Jenkins instance.

**Additional details:**

* The fix was to add an `ADMINISTER` permission check to these endpoints.
* The vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-389 in the Jenkins Security Advisory.
* This issue was fixed in Jenkins versions 2.44 and 2.32.2.
