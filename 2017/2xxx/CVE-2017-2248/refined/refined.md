- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installers for Lhaz+ insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** By placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer or in a location where the installer searches for DLLs, an attacker can cause the installer to load and execute the malicious DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it. The user needs to run the vulnerable installer.
