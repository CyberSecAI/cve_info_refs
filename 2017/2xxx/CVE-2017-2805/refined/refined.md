- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to the `extract_param` function not validating the length of the input when copying data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Stack-based buffer overflow in `extract_param` function
  - Lack of input validation on the length of the data being copied
  - The `extract_param` function does not know the length of the destination buffer.
  - The size of the allocated buffers (64 bytes each) for parameters `usrString`, `pwdString`, and `cmdString` are insufficient to hold arbitrary user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the saved link register and other values on the stack, potentially leading to device compromise. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates that the device can be rebooted cleanly via overwriting the link register.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the device's web management interface. The vulnerability is triggered through the CGIProxy.fcgi service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability as it occurs before user authentication takes place.
