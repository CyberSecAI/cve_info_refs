Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is an insecure DLL search path in the installer for "Setup file of advance preparation" provided by the National Tax Agency. This means that when the installer runs, it searches for required Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files in an insecure manner, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading:** The installer does not properly specify the location of DLL files it needs, which allows it to load DLLs from untrusted locations (e.g., the current working directory). This is a classic DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious DLL with the same name as one the installer is trying to load in a location that is searched before the intended location, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who is running the installer. This could lead to a full compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a directory where the installer would search for it. This is typically in the same folder as the installer is run from, or other predictable locations.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must execute the vulnerable installer.
*   **DLL Hijacking:** The attack relies on the DLL search order of the Windows OS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL on the user's system in a location that is searched by the installer.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into running the installer.
*   The attacker does not need to have user privileges before the attack.

**Additional details from the content:**
* The vulnerability existed in the "Setup file of advance preparation" installer (`jizen_setup.exe`) that was available on the website before June 12, 2017.
* The vulnerable software was used to set up an environment to use the tax filing assistance on the National Tax Agency website.
* The provided CVSS v3 score is 7.8, indicating a high severity.
* The vulnerability was reported by Takashi Yoshikawa of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions.
* JPCERT/CC coordinated with the vendor.
