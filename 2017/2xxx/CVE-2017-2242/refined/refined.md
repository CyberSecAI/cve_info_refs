Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The "Flets Setsuzoku Tool" installer has a vulnerability related to its DLL search path. It insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer does not properly validate the location of DLLs it loads, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs from untrusted locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This means if the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain those as well.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must place a specially crafted malicious DLL in a location where the installer will find it.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must run the vulnerable installer for the attack to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to place a malicious DLL on the target system. This can be done by:
    *   Tricking the user into placing the malicious DLL in a specific folder
    *   Compromising the system beforehand
    *   Using social engineering or other means to deliver the malicious DLL.
*   No special privileges are needed by the attacker prior to the exploit execution, only the ability to place the malicious DLL on the local system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WEST CORPORATION, has stopped providing the "Flets Setsuzoku Tool" on their website since June 30, 2017.
*   There are no patches or fixes available for this vulnerability. The recommended action is to not use the tool and remove any existing installations.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Eili Masami of Tachibana Lab.
*   The provided CVSS v3 score is 7.8 (High), indicating a significant risk.
*   The JPCERT/CC analysis assumes the user is tricked into placing the malicious DLL.
