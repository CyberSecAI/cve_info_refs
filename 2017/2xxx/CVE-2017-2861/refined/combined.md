# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0365

## Natus Xltek EEG NeuroWorks NewProducerStream Use of Return Value Denial of Service Vulnerability

##### April 4, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-2861

### Summary

An exploitable Denial of Service vulnerability exists in the use of a return value in the NewProducerStream command in Natus Xltek NeuroWorks 8. A specially crafted network packet can cause an out of bounds read resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Natus Xltek NeuroWorks 8

### Product URLs

<http://www.natus.com/index.cfm?page=products_1&crid=224>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read

### Details

Natus NeuroWorks 8 provides a networking solution for the Natus Xltek EEG products. In particular, it is used to monitor and review study data from anywhere on the network. This advisory looks into the NWStorage service bundled with NeuroWorks.

The modules used in this advisory is shown below:

```

    Timestamp:        Wed Nov 06 09:58:18 2013 (527A833A)
    CheckSum:         0001779F
    ImageSize:        00012000
    File version:     8.0.1.1544
    Product version:  8.0.1.1544

```

During the processing of the `NewProducerStream` command, a `KeyTree` data structure is expected. This data structure is a simple key-value structure similar to a `map`. A key of `Study` is expected to have an `ItemList` object that will be used for later processing. The pseudocode for this particular section of code is shown below:

```
Storage.exe+0x34BA0:

keytree_1 = (CKeyTree *)CItem::Next(v8);                 // [0]
...
study_key = "Study";
study_fromkeytree = CKeyTree::GetAt(keytree, study_key); // [1]
study_itemlist = CItem::AsItemList(study_fromkeytree);   // [2]
if ( study_itemlist == (CItemList *)-1 )                 // [3]
{
    CEtlException::CEtlException(&ex, "s:\\eegworks\\source\\storage\\storevw.cpp", 522, 0xC1010001, 0, 0, 0, 3);
    CEtlException::AddToEventLog(&ex, "s:\\eegworks\\source\\storage\\storevw.cpp", 522); // [4]
    CEtlException::~CEtlException(&ex);
}
v47 = (char *)-1;
v19 = CItemList::Head(study_itemlist); // [5]
v20 = CItem::AsKeyTree(v19);

```

The `KeyTree` is extracted from the data stream [0] and then the `Study` key is extracted [1]. The `Study` value is converted to an `ItemList` [2] and finally checked to ensure the conversion to an `ItemList` was valid [3]. If the conversion to an ItemList was invalid, the event is logged.

After logging the event, nothing changes about the return result from `AsItemList`. If there was an error, the return value would be `-1`. Subsequently, this value is passed directly to `CItemList::Head` [5]. Assuming this value is a valid `ItemList`, it is checked to ensure it is not empty by checking the `Next` pointer of the `ItemList`.

```
List!CLinteger::operator long const :
230011e0 8b4114          mov     eax,dword ptr [ecx+14h] // [6]
230011e3 c3              ret

```

Becuase the argument is `-1`, this causes in an Access Violation [6] resulting in a Denial of Service.

### Crash Information
