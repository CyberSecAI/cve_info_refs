Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-2946:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied data when handling JPEG2000 images, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object. (from www.zerodayinitiative.com_5cb7ee5c_20250125_075022.html)
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Another vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer during JPEG2000 parsing. (from www.zerodayinitiative.com_e331dccc_20250125_075020.html)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The application reads memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The application writes data past the end of a heap-allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The heap-based buffer overflow can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Page/File:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing the user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing crafted JPEG2000 data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require local access.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to interact with malicious content (visit a page or open a file).

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2016-11-03, and a coordinated public release of the advisory took place on 2017-01-10.
*   Adobe released security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader to address this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader DC (Continuous and Classic tracks) versions 15.020.20042 and earlier and 15.006.30244 and earlier respectively, as well as Acrobat and Reader XI versions 11.0.18 and earlier
* The vulnerability is categorized as a heap buffer overflow vulnerability that could lead to code execution
