Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-2364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a validation issue in how WebKit handles page loading. Specifically, there's a flaw in how the `Frame::setDocument` function interacts with cached documents. When a document is in the page cache, the `prepareForDestruction` function is not called, which can lead to the frame not being properly detached from the cached document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core vulnerability is a logic flaw related to document caching and frame detachment within WebKit. This logic flaw leads to a state management issue during the loading of web pages. The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating to `about:blank` and then navigating to an external URL. The old about:blank `document` object is not properly detached and can be accessed later even after navigation to a different page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact of this vulnerability is a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) attack. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a different origin, allowing them to potentially:
    - Access sensitive data from other websites.
    - Manipulate content on other websites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user on other websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves a crafted web page that triggers the vulnerability through a series of actions. This includes:
    1. Opening a new window with `about:blank`.
    2. Navigating the new window to a different website, which will cause the document to be cached.
    3. Accessing the cached `document` object of the `about:blank` window after navigating away and injecting javascript, thus leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to the victim.
-   The victim needs to use a vulnerable version of WebKit, such as Safari 10.0.2(12602.3.12.0.1).
-   The attacker needs no special privileges and can execute the exploit remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The exploit is demonstrated using JavaScript code provided in the exploit-db entry.
-   The vulnerability is present in WebKit and affects multiple platforms.
-   The issue is fixed in Safari 10.0.3, iOS 10.2.1 and WebKitGTK+ 2.16.3.
