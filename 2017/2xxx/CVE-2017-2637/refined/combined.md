# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c0)  Summer Long    2017-03-02 06:18:56 UTC  ``` OSP director was found to deploy libvirtd listening on 0.0.0.0 with no-authentication and in some cases no network ACL's. Anyone able to make a tcp connection to any compute host IP address, including 127.0.0.1, other loopback interface addresses or in some cases even those exposed beyond the management interface, could use this to open a virsh session to the libvirtd instance and gain control of virtual machine instances or possibly take over the host.  External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3022771> <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0007>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c3)  Daniel Berrangé    2017-03-07 12:11:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Summer Long from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c0)) > OSP director was found to deploy libvirtd listening on 0.0.0.0 with > no-authentication and in some cases no network ACL's.

Thanks Dan. I modified the text to add "(including 127.0.0.1 or other loopback interface addresses)". I think that should make the local escalation path clear.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c5)  Ollie Walsh    2017-03-09 15:29:51 UTC  ``` Dan raise this issue for the upstream docs long ago [https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+bug/1287194](https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/%2Bbug/1287194)  Which resulted in <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0007>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c13)  Summer Long    2017-03-29 23:00:18 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: David Gurtner (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-17 12:23:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2017:1242 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1242](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1242)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c31)  Garth Mollett    2017-05-17 20:35:31 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  A KCS article with more details on this flaw is available at: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3022771>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-19 14:46:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka) director  Via RHSA-2017:1504 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1504](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1504)   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-20 12:25:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform director 7.0 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:1537 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1537](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1537)   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-20 12:46:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty) director  Via RHSA-2017:1546 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1546](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1546)   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c35)  Stephen Gordon    2017-06-20 19:18:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Garth Mollett from [comment #31](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c31)) > Mitigation: >  > A KCS article with more details on this flaw is available at: > <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3022771>  I've updated the article to reflect that the relevant erratum have been released for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 7, 8, 9.   ``` |  |

## Live migration instructions recommend unsecured libvirt remote access

### Summary

When using the KVM hypervisor with libvirt on OpenStack Compute nodes,
live migration of instances from one Compute server to another requires
that the libvirt daemon is configured for remote network connectivity.
The libvirt daemon configuration recommended in the OpenStack
Configuration Reference manual configures libvirtd to listen for
incoming TCP connections on all network interfaces without requiring any
authentication or using any encryption. This insecure configuration
allows for anyone with network access to the libvirt daemon TCP port on
OpenStack Compute nodes to control the hypervisor through the libvirt
API.

### Affected Services / Software

Nova, Compute, KVM, libvirt, Grizzly, Havana, Icehouse

### Discussion

The default configuration of the libvirt daemon is to not allow remote
access. Live migration of running instances between OpenStack Compute
nodes requires libvirt daemon remote access between OpenStack Compute
nodes.

The libvirt daemon should not be configured to allow unauthenticated
remote access. The libvirt daemon has a choice of 4 secure options for
remote access over TCP. These options are:

* SSH tunnel to libvirtd's UNIX socket
* libvirtd TCP socket, with GSSAPI/Kerberos for auth+data encryption
* libvirtd TCP socket, with TLS for encryption and x.509 client certificates for authentication
* libvirtd TCP socket, with TLS for encryption and Kerberos for authentication

It is not necessary for the libvirt daemon to listen for remote TCP
connections on all interfaces. Remote network connectivity to the
libvirt daemon should be restricted as much as possible. Remote
access is only needed between the OpenStack Compute nodes, so the
libvirt daemon only needs to listen for remote TCP connections on the
interface that is used for this communication. A firewall can be
configured to lock down access to the TCP port that the libvirt daemon
listens on, but this does not sufficiently protect access to the libvirt
API. Other processes on a remote OpenStack Compute node might have
network access, but should not be authorized to remotely control the
hypervisor on another OpenStack Compute node.

### Recommended Actions

If you are using the KVM hypervisor with libvirt on OpenStack Compute
nodes, you should review your libvirt daemon configuration to ensure
that it is not allowing unauthenticated remote access.

Remote access to the libvirt daemon via TCP is configured by the
"listen\_tls", "listen\_tcp", and "auth\_tcp" configuration directives. By
default, these directives are all commented out. This results in remote
access via TCP being disabled.

If you do not need remote libvirt daemon access, you should ensure that
the following configuration directives are set as follows in the
/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf configuration file. Commenting out these
directives will have the same effect, as these values match the internal
defaults:

```
listen_tls = 1
listen_tcp = 0
auth_tcp = "sasl"

```

If you need to allow remote access to the libvirt daemon between
OpenStack Compute nodes for live migration, you should ensure that
authentication is required. Additionally, you should consider enabling
TLS to allow remote connections to be encrypted.

The following libvirt daemon configuration directives will allow for
unencrypted remote connections that use SASL for authentication:

```
listen_tls = 0
listen_tcp = 1
auth_tcp = "sasl"

```

If you want to require TLS encrypted remote connections, you will have
to obtain X.509 certificates and configure the libvirt daemon to use
them to use TLS. Details on this configuration are in the libvirt
daemon documentation. Once the certificates are configured, you should
set the following libvirt daemon configuration directives:

```
listen_tls = 1
listen_tcp = 0
auth_tls = "none"

```

When using TLS, setting the "auth\_tls" configuration directive to "none"
uses X.509 client certificates for authentication. You can additionally
require SASL authentication by setting the following libvirt daemon
configuration directives:

```
listen_tls = 1
listen_tcp = 0
auth_tls = "sasl"

```

When using TLS, it is also necessary to configure the OpenStack Compute
nodes to use a non-default URI for live migration. This is done by
setting the following configuration directive in /etc/nova/nova.conf:

```
live_migration_uri=qemu+tls://%s/system

```

For more details on libvirt daemon remote URI formats, please see the
following libvirt daemon documentation:

* <http://libvirt.org/remote.html#Remote_URI_reference>

For details on configuring SASL authentication and X.509 certificates
for the libvirt daemon, please consult the libvirt daemon documentation
at the following locations:

* <http://libvirt.org/remote.html>
* <http://libvirt.org/auth.html>

When configuring the libvirt daemon for authentication, it is also
important to configure authorization to restrict remote access to your
OpenStack Compute nodes. For example, if you don't configure
authorization, any X.509 client certificate that is signed by your
issuing CA will be allowed access. When using SASL/GSSAPI for Kerberos
authentication, any client with a valid TGT will be granted access.
Lack of authorization can allow unintended remote access. The libvirt
daemon documentation should be consulted for details on configuring
authorization.

In addition to requiring authentication for remote access to the libvirt
daemon on your OpenStack Compute nodes, it is also recommended to
restrict network access such that connectivity is only allowed between
the Compute nodes.

The first thing that should be done is to restrict the network
interfaces that the libvirt daemon listens on for remote connections.
By default, the libvirt daemon listens on all interfaces when remote
access is enabled. This can be restricted by setting the following
configuration directive in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf:

```
listen_addr = <IP address or hostname>

```

Migration in the libvirt daemon also uses a range of ephemeral ports by
default. The connections to these ephemeral ports are not authenticated
or encrypted. It is possible to tunnel the migration traffic over the
regular libvirt daemon remote access port, which will use the
authentication and encryption settings that you have defined for that
port. It is recommended that you do this for the additional security
that it provides. To enable tunnelling of the migration traffic, you
must tell your OpenStack Compute nodes to set the VIR\_MIGRATE\_TUNNELLED
flag for live migration. This is done by setting the following
directive in /etc/nova/nova.conf:

```
live_migration_flag=VIR_MIGRATE_UNDEFINE_SOURCE, VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER, VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED

```

The tunnelling of migration traffic described above does not apply to
live block migration. Live block migration is currently only possible
over ephemeral ports.

If you choose to use the ephemeral migration ports, there are a few
things that you should be aware of. Unfortunately, there is no way to
restrict the network interfaces that these ephemeral ports will listen
on in libvirt versions prior to 1.1.4. If you are running version 1.1.4
or later of the libvirt daemon, you can set the following directive in
/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf to specify what interfaces are used for the
ephemeral migration ports:

```
migration_address = <IP address>

```

It is also recommended to configure the firewall on each OpenStack
Compute node to only allow other Compute nodes to access the ports that
are used for remote access to the libvirt daemon. By default, this is
port 16514 for TLS and 16509 for unencrypted TCP.

Additionally, migration over ephemeral ports uses a port range of
49152-49215. You will need to allow your OpenStack Compute nodes to
communicate with each other over these ports if you choose not to tunnel
the migration traffic over the libvirt daemon remote access port.

You can check what ports you have configured for the libvirt daemon by
looking at the following configuration directives:

```
 tls_port (libvirtd.conf)
 tcp_port (libvirtd.conf)
 migration_port_min (qemu.conf)
 migration_port_max (qemu.conf)

```

If you are running a version of the libvirt daemon older than 1.1.4 and
you want to perform live block migration, you will need to allow your
OpenStack Compute nodes to communicate over port range 5900-49151. If
you are running version 1.1.4 or later of the libvirt daemon, the
regular ephemeral migration port range is used for live block migration.

Please consult the documentation for your firewall software for
instructions on configuring the appropriate firewall rules.

Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1448062#c1)  Marian Krcmarik    2017-05-04 13:52:07 UTC  ``` It seems that a typo was introduced in sshd_config on overcloud compute nodes while trying to configure ssh for live migration. It's not possible to ssh into compute nodes and sshd on computes complains about the bad line 21: "Match LocalAddress 192.168.24.16, User nova_migration" I believe that the comma is not supposed to be there and once I remove the comma, ssh starts to work as expected. There is possibly one more time a problem with comma at line: Match LocalAddress !192.168.24.16,!  For sure sshd complains about the line 21 of the sshd_config where the comma should not be. If we have there more local migration addresses then they are supposed to be separated by comma but It's not the case of our setups.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Description

Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying and monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Security Fix(es):

* A design flaw issue was found in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director use of TripleO to enable libvirtd based live-migration. Libvirtd is deployed by default (by director) listening on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) with no-authentication or encryption. Anyone able to make a TCP connection to any compute host IP address, including 127.0.0.1, other loopback interface addresses, or in some cases possibly addresses that have been exposed beyond the management interface, could use this to open a virsh session to the libvirtd instance and gain control of virtual machine instances or possibly take over the host. (CVE-2017-2637)

It is not merely remote attackers that are a problem. Local unprivileged processes can connect to 127.0.0.1, avoiding any firewalls, and use this to elevate their privileges to root. ie local privilege escalation even if a firewall is present.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c4)  Garth Mollett    2017-03-07 22:57:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Berrange from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c3)) > (In reply to Summer Long from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c0)) > > OSP director was found to deploy libvirtd listening on 0.0.0.0 with > > no-authentication and in some cases no network ACL's.

Thanks Dan. I modified the text to add "(including 127.0.0.1 or other loopback interface addresses)". I think that should make the local escalation path clear.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c5)  Ollie Walsh    2017-03-09 15:29:51 UTC  ``` Dan raise this issue for the upstream docs long ago [https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+bug/1287194](https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/%2Bbug/1287194)  Which resulted in <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0007>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c13)  Summer Long    2017-03-29 23:00:18 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: David Gurtner (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-17 12:23:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2017:1242 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1242](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1242)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c31)  Garth Mollett    2017-05-17 20:35:31 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  A KCS article with more details on this flaw is available at: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3022771>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-19 14:46:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka) director  Via RHSA-2017:1504 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1504](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1504)   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-20 12:25:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform director 7.0 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:1537 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1537](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1537)   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-20 12:46:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty) director  Via RHSA-2017:1546 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1546](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1546)   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c35)  Stephen Gordon    2017-06-20 19:18:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Garth Mollett from [comment #31](show_bug.cgi?id=1428240#c31)) > Mitigation: >  > A KCS article with more details on this flaw is available at: > <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3022771>  I've updated the article to reflect that the relevant erratum have been released for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 7, 8, 9.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1431673#c0)  Jason Guiditta    2017-03-13 15:05:57 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1416994](show_bug.cgi?id=1416994 "CLOSED ERRATA - [BUG] nova vnc server listens on all active interfaces due to hardcoded vncserver_listen value") +++  Description of problem: tripleo templates have hard-coded vncserver_listen value  this behavior causes vnc to listen on all ports on compute servers, including the routable ip, allowing connections from anybody.  We would like to set this like: vncserver_proxyclient_address to the internapi network  /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/puppet/manifests/overcloud_compute.pp  if str2bool(hiera('nova::use_ipv6', false)) {   $vncserver_listen = '::0' } else {   $vncserver_listen = '0.0.0.0' } class { '::nova::compute::libvirt' :   vncserver_listen => $vncserver_listen, }  It's not possible to override this value with yaml parameters   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: Alaways  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install openstack-tripleo-heat-templates 2. Look at the code 3.  Actual results: Cannot override  Expected results: Would like to override  Additional info:  --- Additional comment from Emilien Macchi on 2017-01-27 16:17:53 EST ---  David, this is not a bug but a feature. If you want Live Migration to work, the vncserver_listen must be 0.0.0.0. Otherwise, your VM console won't be available anymore when you migrate your VM to another compute.  You can find some documentation here that confirms what I just wrote: <http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/compute-remote-console-access.html>  I'm closing the bug.  --- Additional comment from David Hill on 2017-01-29 12:59:11 EST ---  Emilien,  We've tested this with the customer and manually changing the VNC listening adress to the IP of the compute node does't seem to affect anything.  Are we sure this is not outdated?  --- Additional comment from Emilien Macchi on 2017-01-30 13:44:26 EST ---  Indeed, it's a bug. Apologize.  --- Additional comment from Jason Guiditta on 2017-03-06 08:38:49 EST ---  As there was no puppet-nova for mitaka, moving to opm  --- Additional comment from Jason Guiditta on 2017-03-13 11:04:03 EDT ---  Needs puppet-tripleo backport, puppet-nova done   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1431673#c1)  Red Hat Bugzilla Rules Engine    2017-03-13 15:06:12 UTC  ``` This bugzilla has been removed from the release and needs to be reviewed and Triaged for another Target Release.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1431673#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-19 14:47:28 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1504)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying and monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Security Fix(es):

* A design flaw issue was found in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director use of TripleO to enable libvirtd based live-migration. Libvirtd is deployed by default (by director) listening on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) with no-authentication or encryption. Anyone able to make a TCP connection to any compute host IP address, including 127.0.0.1, other loopback interface addresses, or in some cases possibly addresses that have been exposed beyond the management interface, could use this to open a virsh session to the libvirtd instance and gain control of virtual machine instances or possibly take over the host. (CVE-2017-2637)

A KCS article with more information on this flaw is available at:
<https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3022771>

This issue was discovered by David Gurtner (Red Hat).

* [English](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3022771)
* [Chinese](https://access.redhat.com/zh-hans/solutions/3139511)

## Environment

* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 is not affected.
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 is affected.
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 is affected.
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8 is affected.
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 7 is affected.

## Issue

A design flaw issue was found in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director use of TripleO to enable libvirtd based live-migration. TripleO did not have support for secure live migration and no additional steps were taken to lock-down the libvirtd deployment by director. Libvirtd is deployed by default (by director) listening on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) with no-authentication or encryption. Anyone able to make a TCP connection to any compute host IP address, including 127.0.0.1, other loopback interface addresses or in some cases possibly addresses that have been exposed beyond the management interface, could use this to open a virsh session to the libvirtd instance and gain control of virtual machine instances or possibly take over the host.

Note: Without the presence of additional flaws, this should *not* be accessible from tenant or external networks.

## Resolution

### Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 includes:

* puppet-tripleo-6.3.0-12.el7ost

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1437016#c0)  Martin Schuppert    2017-03-29 09:47:21 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  This BZ is a spinoff from [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1432571](show_bug.cgi?id=1432571 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [OSP10] after failed openstack overcloud upgrade galera takes >1h to start") in  order to precisely track an issue that we were able to reproduce internally as well. Namely,  when running: openstack overcloud update stack -i overcloud  When trigger an overcloud minor update, the tripleoclient is stuck in IN_PROGRESS and  will timeout after the 4h default timeout, even the update step went through the overcloud node.  Reproduced with:  1) made the stack fail due as of [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1416228](show_bug.cgi?id=1416228 "CLOSED ERRATA - rhosp-director: Failed to minor update overcloud - fails before running yum update.") Note: right now it is not known if a failed updated stack is needed, but it was the steps  which lead to successfully reproduce the issue  [stack@undercloud-0 ~]$ ./overcloud_update_plan_only.sh Removing the current plan files Uploading new plan files Started Mistral Workflow.

Regexp or Enter=proceed (will clear 99cdfbce-30bd-4c73-8055-050a0af48e56), no=cancel update, C-c=quit interactive mode: IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS ...  From the logs of the compute service we see that update on the compute went through and also that the compute signaled suggessfull back to heat-cfn  It was identified that there is an issue with hooks aren't retrieved properly in heat-client [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1436712](show_bug.cgi?id=1436712 "CLOSED ERRATA - hooks aren't retrieved properly")  ~~~ We used hooks on the UpdateDeployment resources while making a minor update. The first  and/or second hooks generally worked fine, but we were waiting forever on the last 2.  The heat hook-poll -n5 overcloud command didn't return anything.  It turns out the client detection of hooks is broken. We don't set the stack_name of  the event correctly, and as we use the stack_name to identify the event, we can't  detect the hooks correctly.  This affects the heat command line client (openstack stack hook poll / heat hook-poll). ~~~  While the tripleoclient is stuck in IN_PROGRESS, we were able to move the update forward by  clearing the next hook for the next  OS::TripleO::Controller resource_type like  "openstack stack hook clear --pre-update 5045a96a-3399-4491-9961-d26e5fc93830 UpdateDeployment"  when we see from the logs that the update went through. After teh update went through all nodes,  the tripleoclient ended with update complete: ... IN_PROGRESS IN_PROGRESS COMPLETE update finished with status COMPLETE  It would seem that tripleoclient fails to detect pending hooks as well. But the implementation  is completely different from the heatclient one, so the bug source ought to be different as well. It's also worth noting that the server side seems fine on that aspect.

There are multiple people connected to it and a stack update in progress, so I assume it is used as part of other bugs as well? Despite my best efforts I've been unable to reproduce the bug exactly so it's difficult for me to confirm if the patch upstream will fix this particular case. Is it possible to apply the patch in your lab or another test environment where the issue has been confirmed?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1437016#c6)  Martin Schuppert    2017-03-31 14:03:49 UTC  ``` 1st run:  * put stack in failed state as mentioned in description [stack@undercloud-0 ~]$ ./overcloud_update_plan_only.sh Removing the current plan files Uploading new plan files Started Mistral Workflow.
