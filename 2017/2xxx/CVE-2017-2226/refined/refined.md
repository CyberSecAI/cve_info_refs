Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The installer for the e-Tax software insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) due to an issue with the DLL search path. This means the installer may load a malicious DLL from the same directory the installer is executed from, if one exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL loading:** The installer doesn't properly validate the source of the DLLs it loads. It is vulnerable to DLL hijacking/planting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful attack will result in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer. Then, when the legitimate installer runs, the malicious DLL is loaded instead of the legitimate one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to place a malicious DLL file in the same directory where the vulnerable installer is executed.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to execute the vulnerable installer.
- The attacker needs to trick the user to place a malicious DLL file prepared by the attacker in a specific folder.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the "Setup file of advance preparation for e-Tax software (WEB version)" distributed before January 4, 2018.
- The issue is not in the e-Tax software itself, but rather the installer used to set it up.
- A fix was released on January 4, 2018 which was to update the installer program, not the software itself.
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 7.8 (High), with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H indicating a local attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, user interaction is required, and the scope is unchanged. The impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability is high.
- The provided CVSS v2 score is 6.8, with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, indicating a Network attack vector, Medium complexity, no authentication required, with Partial impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

This information provides a good picture of the vulnerability and its exploitation.
