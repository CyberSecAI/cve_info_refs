Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-2704:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Encryption keys are stored directly within the system's software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive encryption keys are not protected and are accessible through reverse engineering.
- **Insecure Storage:** Encryption keys are stored within the software, instead of a secure location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can obtain the encryption keys.
- This leads to the exposure of sensitive information that was intended to be protected by encryption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to obtain the software of the affected products.
- Reverse engineering of the software to extract the encryption keys.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the vulnerable software of affected Huawei products.
- Ability to perform reverse engineering to extract the keys.

**Affected Products and Versions**
The advisory lists several affected Huawei products and their versions:

*   Smarthome (1.0.2.364 and earlier)
*   HiAPP (7.3.0.303 and earlier)
