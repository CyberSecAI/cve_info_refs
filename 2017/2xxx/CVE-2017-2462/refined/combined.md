# Advisory Details

March 28th, 2017
## Apple macOS M4A Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-17-189ZDI-CAN-4413

| CVE ID | [CVE-2017-2462](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-2462) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Apple](http://www.apple.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | macOS |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of M4A files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.
