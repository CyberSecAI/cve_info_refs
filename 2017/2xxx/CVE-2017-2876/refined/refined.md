- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `sub_27BEC` function within the `devMng` binary of Foscam C1 IP cameras, specifically when handling the "discovery" command (0x0002) on UDP port 10000.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow in `strcpy` operations within the `sub_27BEC` function when handling the username field extracted from the received message
    - The `strcpy` operations at [12] in the function `sub_27BEC` does not check the length of the input, and copies data to a stack buffer of a limited size.
    - Lack of bounds checking when copying username data into the stack buffer.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the device. The provided proof of concept overwrites the saved program counter (PC) on the stack, allowing for control of program flow and execution of arbitrary code.
    - In the provided exploit PoC the attacker can cause the device to reboot.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to port 10000 of a vulnerable Foscam C1 IP camera.
    - The packet needs to include the "discovery" command (0x0002) with an overly long username.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be on the same network or have network access to the targeted Foscam camera.
    - No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs to send a specially crafted UDP packet.
