- Root cause of vulnerability: DLL hijacking in the installer.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by replacing a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, allowing for privilege escalation or other malicious activity during the installation process.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation occurs through the installer of the Whale browser.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer looks for DLLs and ensure that it is loaded before the intended legitimate DLL.
