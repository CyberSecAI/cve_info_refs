The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in PRTG Network Manager, including CVE-2017-15651.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability (CVE-2017-15651):**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- Specifically, it occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering sensor titles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: User-provided input (specifically sensor titles) is not sanitized before being displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into sensor titles.
- When a user views the sensor information, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- The attacker can potentially steal session cookies or perform other malicious actions within the context of the victim's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the application and have write permissions to modify sensor titles.
- The attacker injects a malicious payload into the sensor title field.
- The payload is triggered when a user hovers the mouse over the sensor, displaying a tooltip containing the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with write permissions on the PRTG Network Manager.
- No user interaction other than viewing the sensor information via mouse-hover is required for the stored XSS attack to execute.
