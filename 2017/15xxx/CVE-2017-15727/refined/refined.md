Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-15727

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation when handling file uploads. Specifically, the application did not prevent users from uploading HTML files as attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. By uploading a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript, an attacker can inject arbitrary scripts that will be executed when the victim accesses the attachment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    - Defacement of the application interface
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Data theft
    - Other malicious actions depending on the scope of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a crafted HTML file as an attachment to a record within the application.
- **Accessing the Attachment:** The attacker then relies on a victim accessing the uploaded attachment.
- **Directory Traversal:** Although not the primary vulnerability, the exploit mentions "reach to last file using directory traversal" suggesting the default paths were predictable or a directory traversal issue was present to access the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have user privileges to upload attachments within the application.
- Access to the application via a web browser.
- The ability to craft a malicious HTML file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in phpMyFAQ versions prior to 2.9.9.
- The provided exploit code includes a basic JavaScript alert to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The fix in version 2.9.9 includes a check to reject files with a `text/html` content type.
