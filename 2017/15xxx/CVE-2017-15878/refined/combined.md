# Exploit Author: Ishaq Mohammed
# Contact: https://twitter.com/security_prince
# Website: https://about.me/security-prince
# Category: WEBAPPS
# Platform: Node.js
# CVE: CVE-2017-15878

Vendor Description:

KeystoneJS is a powerful Node.js content management system and web app
framework built on express and mongoose. Keystone makes it easy to create
sophisticated web sites and apps, and comes with a beautiful auto-generated
Admin UI.
Source: https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/README.md

Technical Details and Exploitation:

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in
fields/types/markdown/MarkdownType.js in KeystoneJS before 4.0.0-beta.7 via
the Contact Us feature.

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15878

Proof of Concept:

1. Navigate to Contact Us page
2. Fill in the details needed and enter the below payload in message field
and send
<a onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)>XSS link</a>
3. Now login as admin and navigate to the above new record created in the
enquiries
4. Move the cursor on the text “XSS link”

Solution:

The issues have been fixed and the vendor has released the patches

https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/4478/commits/5cb6405dfc0b6d59003c996f8a4aa35baa6b2bac

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

November 15, 2017](https://blog.securelayer7.net/exploiting-browsers-using-pastejacking-and-xssjacking-vulnerability/)

October 24, 2017

![Open Source Application Penetration testing](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gratis2017.jpg)
## Overview

Under the Gratis Pentest [2017](https://blog.securelayer7.net/securelayer7-gratis-pentest-summer-2017/), we have evaluated security postures of open source applications. For Gratis 2017 we have selected [KeystoneJS.](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone)In this blog, we are discussing **KeystoneJS Open Source Penetration Testing Report** and releasing the vulnerabilities details.

[KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone) is a powerful Node.js content management system and web app framework built on express and mongoose. Keystone makes it easy to create sophisticated web sites and apps and comes with a beautiful auto-generated Admin UI.

The pentest team at SecureLayer7 performed penetration tests for two days and successfully reported 6 Vulnerabilities to KeystoneJS and the has following vulnerabilities.

**1.** **CSV Excel Macro Injection**

CSV injection is nothing but a formula injection. It takes place if an attacker injects malicious payload and the victim exports the malicious file on to his system. Here the attacker injects malicious payload starting with ‘=,+,-,@’. If the CSV file is not properly validated and open on the target system it can execute the command, which can gain complete control of the target system. A system warning shows up while opening a malicious file that contains the payload. CSV injection can lead to client-side command injection. It is recommended that the server should validate the user input that is starting with +,-,=,@  and append ” ‘ ” before such characters.

**2. Application wide CSRF Bypass**

In CSRF, the attacker performs malicious activities. This includes changing the email, password, submit form depending upon the nature of the action. There are different techniques to bypass CSRF.

1. **Using the CSRF token of another account:**

   Log In to the application with account A. Capture the request and copy the token, then login with B account and replace it with token A.
2. **Creating a token of the same length:**

   Some times the server generates a token of fixed length which, if not validated properly, can replace token with the attacker’s generated token length.
3. **Removing CSRF token:**

   Here the attacker removes the CSRF token and forwards the request.
4. **Bypass with XSS:**

   With the help of XSS, the attacker can grab the token and use it further to exploit the application.
5. **Changing the Request method:**

   If any sensitive information is passed in POST, then try changing the request method to GET.

**3. Cross Site Scripting**

Cross Site Scripting or XSS can be of various types, namely: Reflected, Stored, or DOM-based.

Stored Cross Site Scripting, also known as Persistent XSS, has the most impact of all. It arises when the Vulnerable Web Page allows any user to include or write their own Javascript code inside the existing Web Application, which is then stored onto the Server or Database. Thus, every-time a normal user visits the application, the database or server loads the “extra” Javascript code added by the malicious entity, and the same gets executed in the victim’s browser.

This vulnerability can be leveraged to perform various kinds of attacks, but the most common and damaging attack is to steal the victim’s session cookies and hijack their Session.

**4. Weak Password Policy**

Weak Password Policy means not enabling necessary restrictions on the type of password to be used by the user. A weak password policy increases the probability of an attacker having success using brute force and dictionary attacks against user accounts.

The Password policy enforces the password complexity including length and mixed character requirements.
