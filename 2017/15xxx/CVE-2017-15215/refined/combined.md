Subject: Reflected XSS vulnerability in Shaarli v0.9.1

Hi,

I've discovered a security issue in Shaarli v0.9.1
(<https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli>)

A reflected XSS vulnerability in Shaarli v0.9.1 allows an
unauthenticated attacker to inject JavaScript. If the victim is an
administrator, an attacker can (for example) takeover the admin session
or change global settings or add/delete links. It is also possible to
execute JavaScript against unauthenticated users.

Fix:
<https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/pull/987>
