**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue introduced in Shaarli v0.9.1 due to commit `6ccd0b2`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.

- The injected JavaScript would then execute in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
