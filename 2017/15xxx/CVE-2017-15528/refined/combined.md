* Cryptojacking: Malware that gives cybercriminals access to “mine” cryptocurrency on your computer, at the expense of your resources.
* Formjacking: Malware in which cybercriminals inject malicious code into online forms to steal payment card details on legitimate websites.
* Ransomware: Malware that encrypts a computer’s contents and then demands a ransom to restore them, usually in the form of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin
* Remote Access Trojans (RAT): Malware that gives a cybercriminal a “back door” to remotely access a compromised computer

Cybercriminals also still use malware like viruses, worms and spyware in addition to newer techniques. Norton 360 helps defend against the ways cybercriminals infect devices with malware and compromise online privacy. That’s cyberthreat defense from a trusted leader in consumer cybersecurity.

##### Device Security Questions

### How many devices can I install Norton Device Security on?

Depending on your plan, we offer protection from one to an unlimited number of devices (PCs, Macs, Android smartphones and tablets, iPads, and iPhones). \*

### Why is Norton security software more expensive than other antivirus offerings?

These days, cyber threats are more varied than a virus infecting your PC. That’s why Norton provides real-time protection against existing and emerging threats that could put your personal information at risk.

### I just want antivirus. Can I buy just Norton AntiVirus Plus?

Yes. Norton AntiVirus Plus is ideal to protect one PC or Mac. It offers powerful protection for your device and personal information on it. However, Norton 360 provides multiple layers of protection for devices and online privacy for the whole family.

### What is spyware? How do you protect against it?

Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your device, stealing your Internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware — malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users. Norton 360 has device security which protects against viruses, ransomware, malware, and other online threats as you bank, shop and post online.

In addition, here are four main steps to help protect against spyware:

* Don’t open emails from unknown senders.
* Don’t download files from untrustworthy sources.
* Don’t click on pop-up advertisements.
* Use reputable antivirus software.

### What is malware? How do you protect against it?

Malware is an abbreviated form of “malicious software.” This is software that is specifically designed to gain access to or damage a computer, usually without the knowledge of the owner. There are various types of malware, including spyware, ransomware, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, adware, or any type of malicious code that infiltrates a computer.

Norton 360 has comprehensive protection against malware and spyware for your devices, that may reduce the risk of identity theft.

In addition, be careful about what email attachments you open and be cautious when surfing by staying away from suspicious websites.

### What is ransomware? How do you protect against it?

Ransomware is a malicious software that uses encryption to hold data for ransom, the purpose of which is to extort money from the victims with promises of restoring encrypted data. Like other computer viruses, it usually finds its way onto a device by exploiting a security hole in vulnerable software or by tricking somebody into installing it.

Norton 360 has device security which protects against viruses, ransomware, malware, and other online threats as you bank, shop and post online.

In addition, help protect your data and personal information from ransomware by:

* **Update your operating system and other software**. Software updates frequently include patches for newly discovered security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by ransomware attackers.
* **Don’t automatically open email attachments**. Email is one of the main methods for delivering ransomware. Avoid opening emails and attachments from unfamiliar or untrusted sources.
* **Be wary of any email attachment that advises you to enable macros to view its content**. Once enabled, macro malware can infect multiple files. Unless you are absolutely sure the email is genuine, from a trusted source, delete the email.
* **Back up important data to an external hard drive**. Attackers can gain leverage over their victims by encrypting valuable files and making them inaccessible. If you have backup copies, the hacker no longer holds the upper hand.
* **Use Cloud Backup**. This can help with loss of files in case of a ransomware infection, since having copies of your files available in the cloud gives you a back up plan in case of ransomware.

### What is phishing? How do you protect against it?

These are fake emails that can look surprisingly legitimate. If you get tricked into clicking a link or providing information, thieves can get your passwords and account numbers.

Buying subscription-based antivirus software that specifically targets phishing is one way to help protect against being scammed. Keeping antivirus software up-to-date can help keep a computer protected against ever-evolving threats. Antivirus software can block offending emails that come from a suspect source or contain phrases common to many phishing attempts. Antivirus software like Norton 360◊ can also warn subscribers when they’ve stumbled upon an unreliable website. But the most important way to protect against phishing is to be informed. No reputable company will ever ask their customers for account numbers, credit card numbers, logins or passwords. Never enter sensitive information on a website that isn’t on a secure connection.

### What is a Smart Firewall? Why do I need this?

A Smart Firewall is the network security in Norton 360 that monitors the traffic to and from your network and can either allow or block that traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

Norton 360 Smart Firewall helps protect your device and your data from malicious attacks and intrusive eyes by monitoring and blocking suspicious network traffic.

### What is the Virus Protection Promise?

Keeping your devices free from viruses is at the heart of what we do. In fact, we are so confident in our antivirus and malware protection, it’s guaranteed. Should your device become infected by a virus, Member Services & Support are on-call to help.∆ If they can’t remove the virus, you get your money back.2

### What is Cloud Backup?

Cloud Backup for PC stores and protects important files and documents as a preventative measure to data loss due to hard drive failures, stolen devices and even ransomware.‡‡

### How can I protect my kids from online threats?

Help protect your kids from online threats with Parental Control‡ included with Norton 360, so they can enjoy their connected world more safely.

### What parental control features are offered?

Norton 360 comes with easy-to-use Parental Control that allows you to set screen time limits for kids11, block unsuitable sites, monitor search terms and their overall activity history.‡

### Can I monitor how much time my kids are spending online?

Yes, with Parental Control‡ from Norton 360, you can help your kids balance time spent online by scheduling screen-time limits for their device usage.11

### Can I monitor what sites my kids are going to online?

Yes, Parental Control‡ helps your kids explore the Web more safely by keeping you informed of which sites they are visiting, as well as blocking harmful or inappropriate sites.

### Can I monitor what my kids are searching for?

Yes, Parental Control‡ provides insights into the search terms and videos8 that interest your kids and flags unsafe behavior, so you can discuss it with them.9

##### Identity Theft Protection Questions

### What is identity theft?

Identity theft is when someone uses your personal information for their gain and your loss. Personal information can include your Social Security number, birth date, email address and passwords. Criminals could potentially steal from retirement accounts, rent property and even commit crimes – all in your name. Sometimes it could take months or years before anyone notices and the restoration process can also be lengthy.

### How does LifeLock Identity Theft Protection work?

LifeLock identity theft protection uses innovative monitoring technology and alert tools to help proactively safeguard your credit and finances.† We’ll send you alerts for potential identity theft by text, phone††, email or mobile app. If identity theft does occur, a U.S.-Based Identity Restoration Specialist, dedicated to you, is there to personally manage your case.

### What is the Dark Web?

This is an underground online community where criminals can go to buy and sell your personal information. Norton 360 has Dark Web Monitoring§, where the dark web is monitored for your personal information and notifications are sent if we find your personal information.

### What does Dark Web Monitoring do?

Dark Web Monitoring§ shines a light on the dark web, notifying you if your personal information is found. Depending on your chosen plan, we can monitor for: your name, driver’s license, SS#, date of birth, mother’s maiden name, address, phone numbers, bank accounts, and credit cards.

### What’s included in Stolen Wallet Protection?

A stolen wallet could mean a stolen identity. If your wallet is stolen, you can call us and we’ll help cancel or replace credit cards, driver’s licenses, Social Security cards, insurance cards and more.

### How does the Million Dollar Protection™ Package work?

The LifeLock Million Dollar Protection Package††† is available should the unexpected happen and you become a victim of identity theft. You will be covered for personal expenses you incur and money stolen as a result of identity theft, up to the limits of your plan. We will also provide lawyers and experts, up to $1 million, if needed to help resolve your case.

### I don’t have $1 Million in my bank account. Why do I need the Million Dollar Protection Package?

It’s not only the money that’s stolen that matters. The LifeLock Million Dollar Protection Package††† will include coverage for lawyers and experts, up to $1 million, to help resolve your case, if needed.

### Can I add additional users to receive LifeLock protection?

Yes. We recommend that you help protect additional family members with their own membership.

### I have free credit monitoring. How is this different?

Having credit monitoring is a good proactive step but you could miss certain identity threats by just monitoring your credit. Norton 360 with LifeLock can alert† you to key changes to your credit file3, applications submitted using your personal information or if we see your personal information on the dark web.

### Why do I need credit monitoring at more than 1 bureau?

With Norton 360 with LifeLock Ultimate Plus, we monitor key changes to your credit file at the three leading credit bureaus and alert you to help detect fraud.3 While most of the information is similar, the three bureaus may have different sources or different ways of storing the data, so your information may vary among the bureaus.

3 If your plan includes credit reports, scores, and/or credit monitoring features ("Credit Features"), two requirements must be met to receive said features: (i) your identity must be successfully verified with Equifax; and (ii) Equifax must be able to locate your credit file and it must contain sufficient credit history information. IF EITHER OF THE FOREGOING REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE CREDIT FEATURES FROM ANY BUREAU. If your plan also includes Credit Features from Experian and/or TransUnion, the above verification process must also be successfully completed with Experian and/or TransUnion, as applicable. If verification is successfully completed with Equifax, but not with Experian and/or TransUnion, as applicable, you will not receive Credit Features from such bureau(s) until the verification process is successfully completed and until then you will only receive Credit Features from Equifax. Any credit monitoring from Experian and TransUnion will take several days to begin after your successful plan enrollment.

##### Secure VPN & Online Privacy Question

### Can I install Norton Secure VPN on my device?

Norton Secure VPN may be used on 1, 5, 10 or unlimited\* Windows PCs, Macs, iOS and Android devices, with unlimited use during the subscription term, depending on your plan.

### How does Norton Secure VPN help protect my online privacy?

Secure VPN helps protect your online privacy by blocking intrusive activities like tracking or controlling your online activities or location by Internet service providers, mobile carriers, advertisers, and websites.

### What is a Virtual Private Network or VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a private network within a broader network, adding security by using encryption and tunneling mechanisms.

### Where are the Norton Secure VPN servers located?

Norton Secure VPN has over 2000+ servers in 30 countries/locations, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. And this number is growing. Additionally, each country has at least two servers, so you won't always connect to the same IP or data center when you turn on the VPN and connect to any specific region.

### What information can my Internet service provider (ISP) and websites see when I use Norton Secure VPN?

None. With Norton Secure VPN, we help keep what’s information is yours, yours.

### How can I make sure my Wi-Fi connection is safe?

One of the best ways you can help protect your data on unsecured Wi-Fi networks is to use a personal VPN, like Norton Secure VPN. Using a VPN is an easy way to help protect your data as it’s transmitted in an encrypted format – almost like a secret code that only you and your VPN share. We released Norton Secure VPN to help stop hackers from stealing your private information over unsecured Wi-Fi.

### What does bank-grade connection mean?

Bank-grade encryption means that the messages that are sent between your computer and the wireless router are in the form of a “secret code,” so that they cannot be read by anyone who doesn’t have the key to decipher the code.

### Why did you change the name from WiFi Privacy to Secure VPN?

Norton Secure VPN is replacing Norton WiFi Privacy. When Norton WiFi Privacy launched, general awareness of the function of a VPN was limited. As online privacy and security continues to make headline news, users’ awareness of what a VPN does also increases, so by changing the name, we want to drive VPN awareness and education. In addition, with the evolving threats facing consumers as well as the proliferation of free public Wi-Fi, the timing is right to provide consumers with a strong trusted VPN-focused product like Norton Secure VPN.

### Do I need to use VPN if my wireless connection has a password?

Yes. Connecting your device to a password-protected Wi-Fi access point does not protect your data as it is broadcast from your device to the hotspot. Passwords on Wi-Fi access points only ensure authorized users are connecting to the hotspot. So, your data may be at risk as it traverses the airwaves between your device and the hotspot. Also, if you are using public Wi-Fi where all users have access to the same password, it may not be secure from hackers and snoops.

### What devices does this work on? Does this work on my phone/tablet/computer?

Yes. Norton Secure VPN is compatible with PCs, Macs, Android smartphones and tablets, iPads, and iPhones.

### I have free VPN software. Why would I pay for Norton Secure VPN?

Free is not always free. Often, free VPN products trade your information to help offset their costs. Others significantly throttle your bandwidth or otherwise limit VPN data use per month, which can degrade the quality of service and/or depletes your monthly VPN data allowance if sending/streaming media like videos, pictures, music, etc. Offering Norton Secure VPN as a paid subscription allows us to deploy a powerful, yet easy-to-use VPN that helps protects your Wi-Fi connections, bandwidth and privacy without the fuss caused by free VPN services.

Norton Secure VPN does not impose data or bandwidth limits or advertisements on you. An unlimited data and bandwidth VPN service has significant ongoing costs. Those costs are necessary to ensure your privacy. We also offer a 60-day money-back guarantee for annual subscriptions if users are not satisfied with the product.

### What is SafeCam?

The webcam on your PC is a great way to keep in touch with family, friends or business associates. But it can also be vulnerable to hacking. With SafeCam, you’ll get notified of attempts to use your webcam, so we can help block unauthorized webcam access.

##### Installation Questions

### Why do I need a Norton account?

With a Norton account you can do all of the following:

* Activate your product
* Access your PC Cloud Backup
* Manage your Norton subscriptions
* Reinstall Norton products by using your product keys stored in your account
* Buy storage to add more space for your PC Cloud Backup
