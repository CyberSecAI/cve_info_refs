Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15528:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Norton Security for Mac stub installer versions prior to 7.6 not properly validating the SSL certificates received when connecting to the download server for the main installer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The installer fails to verify the SSL certificates, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Spoofed Content:** An attacker performing a MitM attack can present a bogus SSL certificate to the stub installer. This can lead to the installer accepting a spoofed download server and potentially downloading malicious software instead of the legitimate Norton Security for Mac installer.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker needs to be positioned between the user's machine and the download server to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the Norton download server. This could be done via:
   - On a shared network (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
   - By compromising a router or other network device.
   - Through DNS spoofing or poisoning.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on August 26, 2017.
- Symantec released a fix (version 7.6 of the stub installer) on November 20, 2017.
- CERT/CC published the vulnerability note VU#681983 on November 21, 2017.
