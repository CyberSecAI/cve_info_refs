- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing check on API operations. The PowerDNS Authoritative Server API allows some operations that modify the server's state, such as cache flushing, zone transfers, and sending NOTIFY messages, even when the API is configured as read-only using the `api-readonly` setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient access control on API operations when the `api-readonly` configuration is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. An attacker with valid API credentials can perform operations like flushing the cache, triggering a zone transfer, or sending a NOTIFY, which can disrupt the normal operation of the nameserver.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the PowerDNS Authoritative Server API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid API credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
