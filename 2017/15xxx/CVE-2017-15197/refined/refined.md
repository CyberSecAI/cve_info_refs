{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application did not properly validate if a user had the necessary permissions to access or modify project resources, allowing authenticated users to bypass access controls by altering form data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Lack of input validation for project resource identifiers"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user could modify or access private project data and settings belonging to another user. This includes:\n  - Editing project details (name, email, identifier, description)\n  - Adding tasks\n  - Editing columns, categories, swimlanes, and tags\n  - Adding and removing automatic actions\n  - Editing tasks\n  - Adding external and internal links\n  - Downloading and removing attachments\n  - Seeing thumbnails of pictures\nThese issues can lead to data corruption, unauthorized access, and privacy violations.",
    "attack_vectors": "By altering form data in HTTP requests, an attacker could supply an ID of a resource belonging to another user's private project. The application would then process the request as if the attacker had access to this resource, leading to unauthorized actions.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application."
