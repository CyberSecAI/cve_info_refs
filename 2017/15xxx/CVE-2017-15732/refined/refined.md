The provided content is a commit diff from a phpMyFAQ repository on GitHub. It shows the changes made to the `news.php` file in the admin directory. This commit introduces a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) check to several actions including adding and deleting news items.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant parts:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The original code was missing CSRF protection for actions like adding and deleting news. This made the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:**  Without proper CSRF protection, an attacker could potentially trick an authenticated user into performing unintended actions (e.g., adding or deleting news items) by submitting malicious requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially manipulate news content by adding or deleting items without the user's direct consent. This could damage the integrity of the website and potentially spread misinformation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to create a malicious webpage or email that includes a form that submits a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint of the application.
*   The attacker could trick the user to visit the malicious page, and upon loading of the page the malicious form is automatically submitted with the user's cookies/session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests that look like they are coming from the legitimate user.
*   The attacker does not need to know the value of the CSRF token because the vulnerability is that it was missing in the first place.
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin user into visiting their malicious site/link.

**Code Changes & Fix:**
The commit implements CSRF protection:

*   **CSRF Token Generation:** The application generates a CSRF token and stores it in the user's session. `$_SESSION['phpmyfaq_csrf_token']` is the variable used for storing the CSRF token.
*   **CSRF Token Validation:**  The code now checks if a CSRF token submitted with the request matches the one stored in the session. If the check fails, actions like adding, deleting news are not performed.
    ```php
    $csrfToken = PMF_Filter::filterInput(INPUT_POST, 'csrf', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
    if (!isset($_SESSION['phpmyfaq_csrf_token']) || $_SESSION['phpmyfaq_csrf_token'] !== $csrfToken) {
        $csrfCheck = false;
    } else {
        $csrfCheck = true;
    }
    ```
*   **Hidden Form Field:** A hidden form field is added to forms in `news.php` to submit the CSRF token.
    ```html
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="<?php echo $user->getCsrfTokenFromSession() ?>">
    ```
*   The vulnerability is patched with these additions of CSRF checks to add and delete news sections of the news.php file.

This commit directly addresses the missing CSRF check, and thus is directly related to CVE-2017-15732.
