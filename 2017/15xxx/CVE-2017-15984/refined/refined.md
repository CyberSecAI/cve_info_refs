Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `S` parameter within the `index.php` file.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability is present, allowing an attacker to inject SQL commands. This particular instance shows both boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection techniques are possible.

*  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries which could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Data manipulation
    *   Potential complete compromise of the database server.

*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via the HTTP GET request, specifically using the `S` parameter in the URL:
    `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?S=[SQL]`

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a basic understanding of SQL syntax. No authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite for exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional details not in the CVE description:**

*   The specific vulnerable parameter `S` in `index.php` is identified, providing more granular information for replicating the exploit.
*   The exploit details different types of SQL Injection that can be used to exploit the vulnerability, including Boolean based and time based injection.
*   The provided exploit includes a proof-of-concept query that utilizes MySQL-specific functions to extract database information.

The provided content includes significantly more detail than the standard CVE description, detailing not just the existence of the SQL injection vulnerability, but how to exploit it.
