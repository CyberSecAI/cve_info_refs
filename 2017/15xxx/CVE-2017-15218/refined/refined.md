Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15218:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in a series of memory leaks within the `ReadOneJNGImage` function of ImageMagick when handling JNG image files. Specifically, there are multiple instances where memory allocated for image data and related structures is not freed when errors occur during the image processing. This includes scenarios such as:

*   Zero or negative image dimensions detected
*   Memory allocation failures
*   Image processing failures

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory Leaks:** The core issue is a failure to free allocated memory in error handling paths. This leads to memory leaks which can eventually cause denial-of-service by exhausting available system memory. Specifically, the following resources were not properly freed:
    *   `chunk`: memory allocated for the image chunk
    *   `color_image` : allocated memory for color image
    *  `color_image_info` : allocated memory for color image info
    *   `alpha_image` : allocated memory for alpha image
    *   `alpha_image_info`: allocated memory for alpha image info
    * `jng_image`: allocated memory for JNG image

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly triggering these memory leaks by providing specially crafted JNG images can cause the application to exhaust available memory, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice mentions the possibility of code execution with user privileges, although the provided code snippets do not demonstrate how this would occur. It's possible that a more complex exploit could leverage the memory corruption to achieve code execution. The Github content does not mention this impact.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker provides a specifically crafted JNG image file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to ImageMagick:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious JNG image to a program using the vulnerable ImageMagick library. This could be via uploading a file, including an image in a web page, etc.
* **Knowledge of the JNG format**: the attacker needs to have the knowledge to craft a malicious JNG file that triggers the error conditions where memory is not freed.

**Additional details**
* The provided GitHub issue describes the vulnerability in detail and includes the code snippets that require patching to fix the memory leaks, which are not specified in the Ubuntu Security Notice.
*  The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3681-1) confirms the memory leak vulnerability in ImageMagick, specifically while handling malformed image files. This notice also indicates the possibility of code execution and also lists multiple other CVEs fixed in the same patch. The Github issue only describes a memory leak.
* The Ubuntu Security Notice provides a list of affected packages and versions which should be upgraded to address the vulnerability.
