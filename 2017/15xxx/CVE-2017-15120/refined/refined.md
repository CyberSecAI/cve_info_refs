Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-15120

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A parsing error occurs in PowerDNS Recursor when handling authoritative DNS answers that contain a CNAME record with a class other than `IN`. This leads to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper parsing of CNAME records with non-`IN` classes.
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to a crash of the PowerDNS Recursor service due to a null pointer dereference. This can disrupt DNS resolution services for users relying on the affected recursor.
- No system compromise is mentioned, as the crash is not considered exploitable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- The attacker needs to control or manipulate an authoritative DNS server to send a crafted DNS response to the vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to influence or control an authoritative DNS server that is queried by the vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor.
- No authentication is needed. The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted response received by the recursor.

**Affected Versions:**
- PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.7.
- Not affected versions: 3.7.4, 4.0.8, and 4.1.0

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to a non-affected version (4.0.8 or later).
- Run the PowerDNS Recursor within a supervisor like `supervisord` or `systemd` to enable automatic restarts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Toshifumi Sakaguchi.
- Patches are available for 4.0.7.
- Debian has issued a security advisory (DSA-4063-1) and fixed the issue in version 4.0.4-1+deb9u3 for the stable distribution (stretch).
