Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed by the commits related to CVE-2017-15207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper authorization checks in Kanboard before processing form data. Specifically, the application didn't verify if the authenticated user had the necessary permissions to modify resources (e.g., project settings, tasks, categories, etc.) of another user's private projects. This allowed attackers to manipulate form data and gain unauthorized access to these resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

Multiple vulnerabilities were identified, all stemming from the same root cause:

1.  **Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated users could modify private projects of other users by altering form data. This includes:
    *   Editing project details (Name, Email, Identifier, Description)
    *   Adding new tasks to private projects.
    *   Editing columns of private projects.
    *   Adding new categories to private projects.
    *   Editing categories of private projects.
    *   Editing swimlanes of private projects.
    *   Editing tags of private projects.
    *   Adding automatic actions to private projects.
    *   Removing columns from private projects.
    *   Removing categories from private projects.
    *   Viewing names of tags of a private project.
    *   Removing automatic actions from a private project.
    *   Editing tasks of a private project.
    *   Adding external links to a private project.
    *   Adding internal links to a private project.
    *   Downloading attachments from private projects.
    *   Viewing thumbnails of pictures from private projects.
    *   Removing attachments from private projects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could:

*   **Gain unauthorized access to sensitive project data:** By modifying project descriptions, categories, and tasks.
*   **Disrupt project workflows:** By adding or deleting tasks, categories, and columns.
*   **Cause data loss or manipulation:** By removing attachments and other project resources.
*   **Leak sensitive information:** By viewing names of tags or project details.
*   **Gain control over project automation:** By adding or removing automatic actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves manipulating HTTP form data sent to the application. An attacker would need to:

1.  Be an authenticated user of the Kanboard application.
2.  Identify the form fields related to project resources they do not have access to.
3.  Modify the form data to target resources of a different user's private project.
4.  Submit the modified form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the Kanboard system.
*   The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the HTTP form requests.

**Additional Details:**

The provided commit logs show the code changes made to address these issues. These changes primarily involve:

*   **Adding checks:** Implement authorization checks within the controller classes (`BaseController.php` and specific controllers for various resources like `ActionController.php`, `CategoryController.php`, `ColumnController.php` etc) to ensure the current user has permission to modify the requested resources.
*  **Specifically fetching resources:** Added methods within `BaseController.php` to retrieve resources like columns, swimlanes, categories etc. using the provided IDs, and ensuring that these resources belong to the currently accessed project by checking the `project_id`.  This prevents users from accessing resources by using IDs from different projects.

The vulnerabilities were addressed in Kanboard version 1.0.47. The fix involved two primary commits:

*   `https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/074f6c104f3e49401ef0065540338fc2d4be79f0`:  This commit implemented the authorization checks for most resources (projects, actions, categories, columns, swimlanes, tags, custom filters, tasks).
*   `https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/3e0f14ae2b0b5a44bd038a472f17eac75f538524`: This commit applied similar fixes in other controllers which dealt with comments, subtasks, external/internal links, and task modifications.
*   `https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/7100f6de8a1f566e260b3e65312767e4cde112b1`:  This commit addressed attachment download, thumbnail view and attachment removal which were vulnerable as well.

The commits show that the main vulnerability was that the application would use IDs passed in the request parameters without verifying that they belong to the currently accessed project. This allowed authenticated users to perform operations on projects they did not have access to by manipulating the IDs sent in the request.

The security advisory also asks whether to request one CVE for all the issues, or one CVE each.
