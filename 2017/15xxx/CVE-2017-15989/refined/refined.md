```
{
  "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'sort' parameter of the 'resources.php' file.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "SQL Injection vulnerability present in the 'sort' parameter.",
    "Lack of input sanitization for the 'sort' parameter."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion. This could also allow for complete compromise of the database and potentially the underlying system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the 'resources.php' file with a malicious payload in the 'sort' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and no prior authentication or special privileges are required."
