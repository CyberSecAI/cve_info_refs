Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is described as an "image path execution hijacking" issue. This suggests that the GlobalProtect application for macOS may be susceptible to an attack where a malicious user can manipulate the path of an image file that the application attempts to execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Image Path Execution Hijacking:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the paths of image files it attempts to execute.
*   **Lack of Privilege Separation:** The vulnerability is exploitable because the GlobalProtect app runs with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Persistence:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve a certain level of persistence on the compromised host. This means the attacker can maintain access to the system even after a reboot or other interruptions.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a HIGH impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as indicated by the CVSS score. This means an attacker can potentially access sensitive data, modify system files, and disrupt services on the compromised host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally. An attacker needs to have access to the system to carry out the attack.
*   **No user interaction:** The attack doesn't require any user interaction to be carried out.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Administrative Privileges:** The attacker must have root/administrative privileges on the local macOS system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Product and Versions:**

*   GlobalProtect App for macOS versions 4.0.2 and earlier are affected.
*   GlobalProtect App for macOS versions 4.0.3 and later are not affected.
