{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MariaDB server could replicate certain Data Definition Language (DDL) commands to other cluster nodes despite an access control check failure. This was due to replication occurring before access control checks in sql/event_data_objects.cc.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper access control",
    "Replication logic flaw"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user with SQL access to the server could potentially perform unauthorized database modifications on certain cluster nodes without having the necessary privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "A user with SQL access to the server can execute malicious DDL commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires SQL access to the vulnerable MariaDB server."
