- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  A bug in Node.js versions 8.x and 9.x that caused buffers to not be initialized when the encoding for the fill value did not match the specified encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uninitialized buffer, leading to potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure.  The content of uninitialized memory could be exposed to an attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing an encoding for the fill value of a buffer that does not match the specified encoding. For example, `Buffer.alloc(0x100, "This is not correctly encoded", "hex")`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to control the encoding and fill value when creating a buffer. This typically would be through application code.
