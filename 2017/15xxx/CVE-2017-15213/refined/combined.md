Subject: Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Flyspray

Hi,

I've discovered two security issues in Flyspray (<http://www.flyspray.org/>)

A stored XSS vulnerability in Flyspray before 1.0-rc6 allows an
authenticated user to inject JavaScript to gain administrator privileges.

Fix:
<https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/commit/754ec5d04348ef7ecb8cb02ade976dc412b031f8>

A stored XSS vulnerability in Flyspray between 1.0-rc4 and 1.0-rc6
allows an authenticated user to inject JavaScript to gain administrator
privileges and also to execute JavaScript against other users (including
unauthenticated users).

Fix
<https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/commit/00cfae5661124f9d67ac6733db61b2bfee34dccc>

Both issues are fixed in Flyspray 1.0-rc6.

<https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/releases/tag/v1.0-rc6>

I've requested CVE IDs (MITRE).
