The provided content describes two stored XSS vulnerabilities in Flyspray, specifically:

**Vulnerability 1:**
*   **Affected Versions:** Flyspray before 1.0-rc6
*   **Root Cause:**  An authenticated user can inject JavaScript through a vulnerable field, leading to XSS.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization when displaying user details, specifically the `real_name` and `email_address` fields in the `common.editallusers.tpl` template.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain administrator privileges by injecting malicious JavaScript.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An authenticated user crafts a malicious payload within the `real_name` or `email_address` fields when editing their user profile. When an admin views this user in the 'edit all users' interface, the malicious JavaScript is executed in the admin's browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated user account.

**Vulnerability 2:**
*   **Affected Versions:** Flyspray between 1.0-rc4 and 1.0-rc6
*   **Root Cause:**  Similar to vulnerability 1, the application is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient input sanitization.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization when displaying user details, specifically the `real_name` and `email_address` fields in a user management related template.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can gain administrator privileges and execute JavaScript against other users, including unauthenticated users.
*   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated user injects malicious JavaScript via a vulnerable field. This JavaScript is then executed on other users' browsers including unauthenticated users who happen to see that particular content.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated user account.

**Fix:**
Both issues are resolved in Flyspray 1.0-rc6 by using `Filters::noXSS()` to sanitize the output of `real_name`, `email_address`, and `jabber_id` when displayed in the `common.editallusers.tpl` template.

The commit `754ec5d04348ef7ecb8cb02ade976dc412b031f8`  specifically addresses the first XSS vulnerability. This commit shows changes to the `themes/CleanFS/templates/common.editallusers.tpl` file, where `Filters::noXSS()` is applied to `real_name`, and `email_address` outputs, thereby preventing the XSS vulnerability described for Flyspray before version `1.0-rc6`. The commit `00cfae5661124f9d67ac6733db61b2bfee34dccc` fixes the second vulnerability.
