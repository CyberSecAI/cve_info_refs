Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer signedness error within the `EXTRACTOR_nsfe_extract_method` function in `nsfe_extractor.c`. Specifically, the code reads a `chunksize` value from a file, and this value is used to increment a file offset. A crafted file can provide a negative value for `chunksize`, leading to a problematic offset calculation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Signedness Error:** The `chunksize` is read from the file and is not properly validated to be non-negative. This allows a negative value to be used in the offset calculation.
- **Infinite Loop:** Due to negative `chunksize`, the offset `off` is decremented instead of incremented in line 377 which causes the program to enter an infinite loop because the condition `0 == ret` in the `while` statement on line 365 will never be met as `ret` is only assigned values inside the `if` statement and is initialized to `0` before the loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The infinite loop will cause the affected program to hang, consuming resources and becoming unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file that contains a negative value for the `chunksize`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious file to the program to be processed.
- No specific privileges or access to the target system are required beyond the ability to input a file.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information includes the vulnerable code snippet and a gdb session demonstrating the issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered in version v1.4 of libextractor and was fixed in version 1:0.6.3-5+deb7u1.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is due to a signed integer overflow when reading the `chunksize` from the input file, leading to an infinite loop and a denial-of-service. An attacker only needs to provide a malicious file with a negative value for chunksize to trigger the issue.
