Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Mirasys VMS transmits the entire system configuration in cleartext from the Master server to clients every time they log in.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** Sensitive information, including all credentials (system admin accounts, camera IPs, and passwords) and any data entered into the system, is transmitted without encryption.
- **Lack of Public Disclosure:** Mirasys failed to publicly disclose the vulnerability or provide a security advisory, making it difficult for users to be aware of and address the issue.
- **Inadequate Patching Communication:**  The vulnerability was supposedly fixed in some versions, but the company did not communicate this properly to all users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can obtain full access to the VMS system by capturing the transmitted credentials.
- **Camera Exposure:** All connected cameras can be exposed, regardless of the manufacturer's security measures, as their IPs and passwords are leaked.
- **Data Breaches:** Sensitive information, including admin credentials, can be compromised, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
- **Tampering:** Attackers can tamper with the system configuration, disable cameras, or make changes to the recording schedule.
- **Botnet Creation:** Malicious actors could potentially use compromised systems to create botnets by updating camera firmware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** Attackers can use network sniffing tools (e.g., Wireshark) to capture the cleartext data transmitted between the VMS master server and clients during login.
- **Local LAN Access:** Attackers need to be on the same local network as the VMS system to intercept the traffic. This could be an insider, or someone who gained physical access to the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the same local area network as the vulnerable Mirasys VMS.
- **Sniffing Tools:** The attacker needs network sniffing tools like Wireshark.
- **Basic Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to know that such a vulnerability exists and how to use a tool to sniff network traffic.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Mirasys VMS versions, including older ones like 4.x and 5.x which are still in use.
- The initial "fix" in May 2016 stopped the continuous transmission of credentials but still exposed other sensitive information in cleartext.
- The vulnerability is not directly exploitable from the public internet, but once an attacker is inside the LAN it's possible to obtain the credentials and then use them to access the system from outside the network.
