    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory leak occurs in Dovecot when SASL authentication is aborted due to missing memory cleanup.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to memory exhaustion leading to process crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Aborting a SASL authentication process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to initiate and abort a SASL authentication process, potentially requiring network access to the service."
