The provided content relates to CVE-2017-15305.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `keyword` parameter within the `messages.php` file of NexusPHP 1.5. Specifically, the value of `$_GET['keyword']` is directly echoed into the HTML `value` attribute of an input field without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the administrator's browser when the admin views the affected page (messages.php). This allows the attacker to steal the administrator's cookie, effectively gaining access to the administrative account. The content notes that the cookie remains unchanged until the administrator changes their password.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `keyword` parameter. For example:
`http://localhost/messages.php?keyword="><svg/onload=alert(1)>//`
or
`http://localhost/messages.php?keyword="> + anyother html tags included <script>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted URL to a logged-in administrator of the vulnerable NexusPHP instance. The administrator must then visit the URL for the XSS to be triggered.
