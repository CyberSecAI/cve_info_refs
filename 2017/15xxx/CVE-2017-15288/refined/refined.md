Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15288:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Scala compilation daemon did not properly manage permissions for private files, specifically the port file used for communication between the client and the daemon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure file permissions: The port file was created with insecure permissions, allowing other local users to read it and potentially connect to the daemon.
- Predictable file location: The port file was located in a predictable location `/tmp/scala-devel/${USER:shared}/scalac-compile-server-port` which made it easier for an attacker to find.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker could:
- Escalate privileges by executing code as the user that started the compile daemon.
- Write arbitrary class files to any location on the filesystem that the user has access to. This could be used to inject malicious code or overwrite existing files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker needs to have a user account on the target machine.
- The vulnerability is present when the compile daemon is running, which occurs when using the `fsc` command explicitly or implicitly by executing a Scala source file as a script using the `scala` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must be a local user on the system where the vulnerable Scala version is installed.
- Must be able to execute commands on the system.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Scala versions 2.12.4, 2.11.12, and 2.10.7 and later.
- The fix involves changing the location of the port file to `$HOME/.scalac` and setting the permissions to be readable only by the owner.
- The REPL (`scala` command) is not affected because it does not use the compilation daemon.
- The vulnerability is related to how the compilation daemon is used and is not present when running a pre-compiled class file using `scala`.
- A workaround is to use `scala -nocompdaemon MyScript.scala` which disables the implicit start of the daemon when executing scripts, or avoid explicitly starting `fsc`.
- There is also a race condition related to file creation and setting the file permissions which has been attempted to be addressed in later versions.
- The fix was implemented across multiple branches in scala's source code.
-  The vulnerability has a Gentoo Security Advisory: GLSA 201812-08.
