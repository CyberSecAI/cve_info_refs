# Scala: Privilege escalation — GLSA **201812-08**

A vulnerability in Scala could result in privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/scala** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.12.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.12.4** |

### Background

Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one
concise, high-level language.

### Description

It was discovered that Scala’s compilation daemon does not properly
manage permissions for private files.

### Impact

A local attacker could escalate privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Scala users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/scala-2.12.4"

```

Option \"port\" limits compile server lookup and start to given port.
Normally fsc will start a compile server in a random port if no server
is yet running. This can be problematic with firewalls and/or remote
compile servers. Option \"port\" should not be confused with option
\"server\" which looks for a compile server in given host and port and
fails if such server is not found.

Automatic tests for command line user interface do not exist at all.
Thus, adding a test for one new option would require designing a whole
new testing method.

Hide comment

Note that creating a file *then* changing the permissions on the file allows a race condition where an attacker on the system can open the file between the file create and the permissions change. It is far safer to use open(2) to set the permissions restrictive while creating the file.

Furthermore if this code is ever run on a directory with shared writing permissions, it's possible for an attacker to unlink(file), set a symlink in place, and have the process change modes of any target that the process has privileges to modify. fchmod(2) is the safe way to change permissions on a file that is already open, though that won't fix the above race condition. So consider this just an aside.

Thanks

Thank you. Could you suggest how to do this on Java 6? I agree the race condition is a security hole, but couldn't figure out how to do this atomically with the API we have available. I think our NIO-based implementation on Java 8 is closer to what you're suggesting: <https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6120/files#diff-3578ac76088d22b5d9912e984dee3affR46>.

Thank you for the review.

We implemented things that way (or at least, tried to) in the 2.12 branch where we could link against the Java 8 NIO API. Scala 2.11 still supports Java 6.

The #diff-3578ac7.. link above looks like it may have the same race condition.

I don't know Java particularly well any longer, so it's hard to suggest a replacement. Two possibilities come to mind:

* set the umask to 0077 (octal), create the file, set the modes, and then reset umask to whatever the user wanted
* chmod 0700 (octal) the containing directory, create the file, set the file modes, then reset the directory to whatever permissions it should have.

I hope this helps. Thanks.

How about: create the file with some temporary name/location, do what you need to do and then move it. file moves are atomic.

### @adriaanm **[adriaanm](/adriaanm)** commented [Oct 9, 2017](#issue-264011701)

Store the compilation daemon's administrativia (port file, redirection)

under `~/.scalac/`, instead of the less standard

`/tmp/scala-devel/${USER:shared}/scalac-compile-server-port`.

On creation, remove group- and other-permissions from these

private files, ditto for the repl's history file.

Based on [b64ad85](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b64ad85d1cfdfff29d0836a66736d6d2b0830c0e)

# Security update: 2.12.4, 2.11.12, 2.10.7 (CVE-2017-15288)

Monday 13 November 2017

ANNOUNCEMENT

A privilege escalation vulnerability ([CVE-2017-15288](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-15288)) has been identified in the Scala compilation daemon.

We recommend upgrading to the latest versions of Scala ([Scala 2.12.4](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.12.4), [Scala 2.11.12](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.11.12) or [Scala 2.10.7](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.10.7)).

The compile daemon is started explicitly by the `fsc` command, or implicitly by executing
a Scala source file as a script (e.g `scala MyScript.scala`). The Scala REPL, started by `scala` is not affected as it does not use the compilation daemon, nor is running a pre-compiled class using the `scala` command.

# Impact

While the compile daemon is running, an attacker with local access to the machine can
execute code as the user that started the compile daemon, and can write arbitrary
class files to any location on the filesystem that the user has access to.

# Affected Versions

* Scala 2.1.6-2.10.6; 2.11.0-2.11.11; 2.12.0-2.12.3

# Mitigation

* Use `scala -nocompdaemon MyScript.scala` rather than `scala MyScript.scala` to
  disable the implicit startup and use of the daemon.
* Avoid explicitly starting `fsc`
* Upgrade to Scala 2.10.7 2.11.12, 2.12.4 or higher which restricts the sensitive file to be
  readable only by the owner. These releases also change the location of the sensitive
  file: it is written in the directory `$HOME/.scalac`.

# Feedback

Please post any comments on [Discourse](https://users.scala-lang.org/t/security-update-2-12-4-2-11-12-2-10-7-cve-2017-15288/1922).
