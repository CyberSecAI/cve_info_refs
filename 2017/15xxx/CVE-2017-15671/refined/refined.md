{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory leak in the glob function when used with GLOB_TILDE and a pattern that triggers heap allocation, such as '~xxx...xxx/*' with many 'x' characters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak due to incorrect handling of heap allocations in the glob function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to heap exhaustion.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a glob pattern with GLOB_TILDE that forces the glob function to allocate memory on the heap, which is then not released.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to control the glob pattern used by the application."
