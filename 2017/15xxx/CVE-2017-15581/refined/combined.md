*General note: The developer and owner of both the webapp and android app has been contacted multiple times to develop a quick fix for the issues addressed in this blog post and a vulnerability concerning the webapp which isn't described here. However, no response has been received.*

WriteDiary consists of a webapp ([WriteDiary.com](http://writediary.com/)) and an [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adpog.diary) (version 4.72). For the audit, the android app was the primary target.
### **CVE-2017-15581**: Lack of HTTPS-usage, lack of user data encryption when transmitting

In the "Diary with lock" (aka WriteDiary) application 4.72 for Android, neither HTTPS (check *strings.xml* for *api\_url\_prod*: *http://diary.adpog.com/api2)*nor other encryption is used for transmitting data, despite the [documentation](http://writediary.com/) that the product is intended for "a personal journal of secrets and feelings," which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network during LoginActivity or NoteActivity execution.

Vulnerability type: Plaintext data transport

Affected Product Code Base: WriteDiary - 4.72

Affected Component: LoginActivity, NoteActivity\*

Impact: Information Disclosure of sensitive data (diary entries, login data)

### CVE-2017-15582: Usage of static AES parameters

In *net.MCrypt* in the "Diary with lock" (aka WriteDiary) application 4.72 for Android, hardcoded *SecretKey* and *iv* variables are used for the AES parameters, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain the cleartext of stored diary entries:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgk7y1QlCNElb7UK73HJrI2EGsVJgMipVeWK8ZZuIP58SrKff187K6l0C8MVwUi_G-WNTv7tPM9JEhyBn5aDC6-H1yIpkXpRYNREZl4nT-q4oqFVF4jfXTm3_kPdAbOmC9z-8ct46Gmfi-/s1600/staticAES.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgk7y1QlCNElb7UK73HJrI2EGsVJgMipVeWK8ZZuIP58SrKff187K6l0C8MVwUi_G-WNTv7tPM9JEhyBn5aDC6-H1yIpkXpRYNREZl4nT-q4oqFVF4jfXTm3_kPdAbOmC9z-8ct46Gmfi-/s1600/staticAES.png)

As you can see, the specific values are:

*secret key = "f8djD2kfdU31wuRu"*
*iv = "aBcNvn71dkdjf8hf"*

Vulnerability type: Hard coded AES parameters

Affected Product Code Base: WriteDiary - 4.72

Affected Component: net.MCrypt

Impact: Information Disclosure of sensitive data (diary entries)

### Additional note (not relevant for the reported CVEs)

Further analysis showed that the data stored on the webapplication server is **not encrypted**. This means, that the whole concept isn't as private as it claims it is. On top of that, there's a built-in backdoor which lets the administrator access the confidential diary entries of every user.

The secrets stored in the app are application tokens only - in my tests it was not possible to authenticate in user context. The stored AES parameters are used to encrypt and decrypt the locally stored shared preferences in the class called Preferences : Because of the static key, an attacker can gain access to user data more easily by leveraging access to the preferences XML file.

May 9, 2023Really great app, simple UI, and does its job perfectly. Never had any glitching problems with it either. Being able to save your entries with an account to use on a different device is fantastic also. A great addition would be to add photos and change the colour of the actual pages (ex. dark mode). Overall, great app I'd recommend to anyone for some privacy (:44 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWa5BTeb27E3qyd6OWNA7aavzY_8GOWVPshGsozhdsUV_q0gyS3=s32-rw)Lemon Guminski*more\_vert*

March 16, 2022I love this thing lol. I get tired writing in a physical diary so this is perfect :) I kinda want an option to add photos into the notes though. And also I would like to set a pfp. Even though ppl can't see it I think it would be nice. It's a simple app, of course, it's just a diary, but I like it a lot. Good job👍395 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUaSnxTsL6vZs1budzv_JgtK-QyqQhKiM5zD5nS6dVHDMaVwFKv=s32-rw)Ivx-*more\_vert*

December 27, 2024This diary app is really good and, thankfully, free! It's easy to use and helps me stay organized with my thoughts. However, one feature that could make it even better is the ability to save pictures within the entries. It would be great to be able to add images to my diary alongside the text. Otherwise, it's a fantastic app for anyone looking for a simple, free journaling option!36 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews

*General note: The developer and owner of both the webapp and android app has been contacted multiple times to develop a quick fix for the issues addressed in this blog post and a vulnerability concerning the webapp which isn't described here. However, no response has been received.*

WriteDiary consists of a webapp ([WriteDiary.com](http://writediary.com/)) and an [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adpog.diary) (version 4.72). For the audit, the android app was the primary target.
### **CVE-2017-15581**: Lack of HTTPS-usage, lack of user data encryption when transmitting

In the "Diary with lock" (aka WriteDiary) application 4.72 for Android, neither HTTPS (check *strings.xml* for *api\_url\_prod*: *http://diary.adpog.com/api2)*nor other encryption is used for transmitting data, despite the [documentation](http://writediary.com/) that the product is intended for "a personal journal of secrets and feelings," which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network during LoginActivity or NoteActivity execution.

Vulnerability type: Plaintext data transport

Affected Product Code Base: WriteDiary - 4.72

Affected Component: LoginActivity, NoteActivity\*

Impact: Information Disclosure of sensitive data (diary entries, login data)

### CVE-2017-15582: Usage of static AES parameters

In *net.MCrypt* in the "Diary with lock" (aka WriteDiary) application 4.72 for Android, hardcoded *SecretKey* and *iv* variables are used for the AES parameters, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain the cleartext of stored diary entries:

As you can see, the specific values are:

*secret key = "f8djD2kfdU31wuRu"*
*iv = "aBcNvn71dkdjf8hf"*

Vulnerability type: Hard coded AES parameters

Affected Product Code Base: WriteDiary - 4.72

Affected Component: net.MCrypt

Impact: Information Disclosure of sensitive data (diary entries)

### Additional note (not relevant for the reported CVEs)

Further analysis showed that the data stored on the webapplication server is **not encrypted**. This means, that the whole concept isn't as private as it claims it is. On top of that, there's a built-in backdoor which lets the administrator access the confidential diary entries of every user.

NQ Contacts Backup & Restore is an android app that allows users to backup and restore contact data (as vcard) to/from the remote NQ server. For the audit, the android app was the primary target.  Note: The app shares its code base with NQ Mobile Security & Anti Virus  - hence the odd class names for a simple contact backup app. Lack of HTTPS usage  When logging in or transmitting data, the app communicates with the remote server via HTTP. This can be exploited in various ways. One of these is sniffing the request when a user logs in:   As you can see, the username is being transmitted in cleartext.  The password is hashed with SHA-1. An attacker can now crack the SHA-1 hash (because that's pretty easy nowadays): Additionally, an attacker could use the sniffed hash to download the stored contacts from the server directly. As described later, the attacker can also access transmitted contact data. Vulnerability type: Plaintext data tran...

Upon quickly assessing the Oral-B app (com.pg.oralb.oralbapp), the following findings have been made: Hardcoded AES parameters (CVE-2018-5298) and twitter keys These parameters are stored in the class OralBApplication and also get used there: Using the twitter secrets, it's possible to create bearer tokens impersonating the Oral-B twitter application. The secrets stored in the app are application tokens only - in my tests it was not possible to authenticate in user context. The stored AES parameters are used to encrypt and decrypt the locally stored shared preferences in the class called Preferences : Because of the static key, an attacker can gain access to user data more easily by leveraging access to the preferences XML file. Tracking Upon running the app, the user automatically gets tracked. There is no opt-in required, it's enabled by default. As you can see, third party advertising providers are allowed to gain access to the us...
