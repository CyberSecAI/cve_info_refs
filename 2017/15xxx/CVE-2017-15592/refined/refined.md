Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-15592:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of self-linear shadow mappings within the Xen hypervisor when dealing with translated guests. Shadow page table code uses linear mappings to inspect and modify shadow page tables. Self-linear mappings point back to themselves. For translated guests, shadow linear mappings should *not* be self-linear, but for non-translated guests they are intended to be self-linear.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Shadow Mapping Handling:** When creating a monitor page table, a self-linear mapping is initially used for the shadow linear slot. For translated guests, this self-linear mapping should be replaced with a non-self-linear one when the guest's CR3 register is shadowed. However, when writeable heuristics are used, this replacement does not occur and the self-linear shadow mappings are used as part of shadowing CR3, which causes the heuristics to be applied to the Xen's page tables rather than the guest's.
*   **PV Auto-Translate Mode Insecurity:**  While investigating, PV auto-translate mode was also found to be insecure. This mode was removed in Xen 4.7.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious or buggy HVM guest can trigger a hypervisor crash, leading to a denial of service affecting the entire host.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The incorrect handling can lead to hypervisor memory corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The possibility of a guest escalating its privileges due to this vulnerability cannot be ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HVM Guest:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious or buggy HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guest.
*   **Shadow Mode Paging:**  The exploit is only possible when the HVM guest is using shadow mode paging.
*   **Writeable heuristics:** The vulnerability is triggered when writeable heuristics are used to shadow CR3.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have control over an HVM guest configured to use shadow mode paging.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the use of writeable heuristics.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Systems:** All versions of Xen are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** Running only PV (Paravirtualized) guests will avoid this vulnerability. If using HVM guests, enabling Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) instead of shadow paging will mitigate the vulnerability. HAP is enabled by default in upstream Xen.
*   **ARM systems are not vulnerable.**
* The issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.
