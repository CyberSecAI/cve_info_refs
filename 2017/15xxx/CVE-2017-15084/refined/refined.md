The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, and only one of them is related to CVE-2017-15084. The rest are unrelated.

**CVE-2017-5248** is related to  AppSpider Pro: Unauthenticated Reports Retrieval and is described below:

*   **Root Cause:** A combination of a race condition and insufficient controls on temporary files. The generated report from a completed scan was briefly accessible at a predictable URL based on the UTC timestamp (with one minute fidelity) of the report's start.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Race Condition**: A race condition where the report is temporarily available before proper access controls are in place.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control**: Lack of proper restrictions on temporary file access.
    *   **Predictable URL**: The URL where the report is temporarily stored is predictable using the UTC timestamp.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can learn confidential information about a site's vulnerability profile by accessing the scan report.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to be on the same network as the AppSpider Pro installation.
    *   The attacker needs to guess the correct URL using the UTC timestamp of when the report was generated.
    *   The attacker would need to rapidly bruteforce the location since the report is only briefly available.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable AppSpider Pro instance.
    *   Timing: The attacker would need to be able to predict and access the URL within a short window of approximately 30 seconds of the report's generation.
    *   Brute-force capability: The attacker needs the ability to rapidly brute-force the likely locations of the report.
    *   No authentication required: The vulnerability does not require authentication by the attacker.

The content also mentions other vulnerabilities:

*   **CVE-2017-5252 (R7-2017-24)**: DLL Injection in Insight Agent for Windows. This is a medium severity vulnerability (CVSS score 6.3) that could lead to arbitrary code execution, agent data access, and configuration changes by an attacker with local administrative access.
*   **R7-2017-22**: Forced logout via CSRF in Metasploit Pro, Express, Community, Ultimate. This is a low severity vulnerability (CVSS score 3.1) that can lead to denial of service.
*   **R7-2017-26**: Server Side Template Injection in Logentries. This is a medium severity vulnerability (CVSS score 4.3) that can be exploited by injecting Angular.js template expressions in a log line, leading to a stored XSS-like issue, which could compromise the Logentries admin's browser session.
