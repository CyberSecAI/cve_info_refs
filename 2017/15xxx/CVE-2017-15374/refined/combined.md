Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Shopware is a modular online shop system that is since 2004 developed in germany. It is available both as
an open source software as well as in commercial editions. The program can be extended in its functions by
installing additional plugins. An open API allows third-party systems, such as payment services or ERP
systems, to be connected. The system is multi shop capable it can thus be generated within an installation
several shops in different domains. A multi-client capability (complete separation of multishops in the
administration area) is by default, but can be achieved in the cluster.

Shopware AG
Product: Shopware - Content Management System (Web-Application) 5.3

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity Level:
===============
Medium

Technical Details & Description:
================================
The shopware v5.2.5 - v5.3 is vulnerable to cross site scripting in the customer and order section of the content management
system backend modules. Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script code to the firstname, lastname or order
input fields to provoke a persistent execution in the customer and orders section of the backend. The execution occurs
in the shopware administrator backend listing when processing to preview the customers (kunden) or orders (bestellungen).
The injection can be processed by interaction via user registration or by manipulation of the order information inputs.
The web issue can be exploited by low privileged user accounts against higher privileged admin- oder moderator-accounts.

The security risk of the bugs are estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.4.
Exploitation of the issue requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent
external redirect to malicious sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST (Registration)
[+] POST (Order Item)
[+] POST (Profile Update)

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Firstname
[+] Lastname
[+] Order Name

Affected Module(s):
[+] Kunden (Customers)
[+] Bestellungen (Orders)

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The cross site vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged shopware user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1.  Open the the browser and surf to the target shopware v5.2.5 web-application
2.  Move to the registration formular
3.  Include a script code payload with a iframe src onload tag to the firstname, lastname and name parameters
4.  Submit the request via POST method to register the account
5.  Move to the inbox and verify via link the account to activate
Note: Now the payloads are executable saved to the Kunden (Customer) section in the backend
6.  The administrator visits in the next step the Kunden (Customer) section to preview
7.  The script code payload executes in the customers list
8.  As next step the attacker places an order via shop
Note: The order name manipulation via registration is as well able to execute script code the context
9.  The administrator visits in the next step the Bestellungen (orders) section to preview
10. The script code payload executes in the orders list
11. Successful reproduce of the both cross site vulnerabilities!

Note: Attackers are able to inject malicious redirects, frames with payloads or other script code tags.
The basic web validation filter of the shopware content management system does not encode the list context.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The xss vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the customer (kunden) and orders (bestellungen) context listings.
Parse or escape the context and disallow special chars during the registration or add to prevent further script code injection attacks.

The vulnerability can be resolved by an update to version 5.3.4 that is delivered by the manufacturer. The issue risk is marked as moderate.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the stored cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the shopware cms are estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.4)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for

Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Shopware is a modular online shop system that is since 2004 developed in germany. It is available both as
an open source software as well as in commercial editions. The program can be extended in its functions by
installing additional plugins. An open API allows third-party systems, such as payment services or ERP
systems, to be connected. The system is multi shop capable it can thus be generated within an installation
several shops in different domains. A multi-client capability (complete separation of multishops in the
administration area) is by default, but can be achieved in the cluster.

Product: Shopware - Content Management System (Web-Application) 5.2.5
Shopware AG
Product: Shopware - Content Management System (Web-Application) 5.3
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
Technical Details & Description:
================================
The shopware v5.2.5 - v5.3 is vulnerable to cross site scripting in the customer and order section of the content management
system backend modules. Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script code to the firstname, lastname or order
input fields to provoke a persistent execution in the customer and orders section of the backend. The execution occurs
in the shopware administrator backend listing when processing to preview the customers (kunden) or orders (bestellungen).
The injection can be processed by interaction via user registration or by manipulation of the order information inputs.
The web issue can be exploited by low privileged user accounts against higher privileged admin- oder moderator-accounts.
The security risk of the bugs are estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.4.
Exploitation of the issue requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent
external redirect to malicious sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST (Registration)
[+] POST (Order Item)
[+] POST (Profile Update)
Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Firstname
[+] Lastname
[+] Order Name
Affected Module(s):
[+] Kunden (Customers)
[+] Bestellungen (Orders)
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The cross site vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged shopware user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the the browser and surf to the target shopware v5.2.5 web-application
2. Move to the registration formular
3. Include a script code payload with a iframe src onload tag to the firstname, lastname and name parameters
4. Submit the request via POST method to register the account
5. Move to the inbox and verify via link the account to activate
Note: Now the payloads are executable saved to the Kunden (Customer) section in the backend
6. The administrator visits in the next step the Kunden (Customer) section to preview
7. The script code payload executes in the customers list
8. As next step the attacker places an order via shop
Note: The order name manipulation via registration is as well able to execute script code the context
9. The administrator visits in the next step the Bestellungen (orders) section to preview
10. The script code payload executes in the orders list
11. Successful reproduce of the both cross site vulnerabilities!
Note: Attackers are able to inject malicious redirects, frames with payloads or other script code tags.
The basic web validation filter of the shopware content management system does not encode the list context.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The xss vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the customer (kunden) and orders (bestellungen) context listings.
Parse or escape the context and disallow special chars during the registration or add to prevent further script code injection attacks.
The vulnerability can be resolved by an update to version 5.3.4 that is delivered by the manufacturer. The issue risk is marked as moderate.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the stored cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the shopware cms are estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.4)
