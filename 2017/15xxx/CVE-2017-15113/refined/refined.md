Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the inclusion of unmasked passwords in the debug logs of ovirt-engine. When the log level is set to "DEBUG", sensitive password information is written to the log files without any masking or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive password data in log files. This includes passwords used by the application.
*   **Inadequate Logging Practices:** The logging mechanism does not properly handle or mask sensitive data, especially when debug-level logging is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Compromise:** An attacker who gains access to the debug logs could obtain sensitive passwords.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The compromised passwords can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the affected system or related services.
*   **Lateral Movement:** With access to the system, an attacker can potentially move laterally within the network and gain further access to other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log File Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining access to the debug log files. This could be through various means, including:
    *   Compromising a system with access to the log files.
    *   Internal access through a malicious insider.
    *   Exploiting another vulnerability to gain access to the file system
    *   Social engineering to obtain the logs from an administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Log Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the log files where the unmasked passwords are being written.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to access and read log files.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Optional):** If an attacker has limited access, they may need to escalate privileges to access the log files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is specific to ovirt-engine when the log level is set to DEBUG.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in `ovirt-engine-4.1.7.6-0.1` and later, as documented in [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2017:3138](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2017:3138)
*   The bug report for this issue is located at [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512365](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512365).
*   The fix involves masking passwords in the debug logs.

In summary, CVE-2017-15113 is a security vulnerability where ovirt-engine exposes unmasked passwords in its debug logs. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access if they obtain these log files. The vulnerability was resolved with a patch that masks these passwords in the debug logs.
