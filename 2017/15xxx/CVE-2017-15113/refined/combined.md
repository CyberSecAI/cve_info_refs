## Synopsis

Red Hat Virtualization Manager (ovirt-engine) 4.1.7

## Type/Severity

Product Enhancement Advisory

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHEA-2017%3A3138)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Virtualization Manager.

## Description

The Red Hat Virtualization Manager is a centralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.

The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several interfaces for accessing and interacting with the virtual environment, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).

Changes to the ovirt-engine component:

* This update fixes a Manager issue that allowed duplicate MAC addresses even when duplicates are disallowed. (BZ#1485688)
* The precision of rx\_rate, tx\_rate, rx\_drop, and tx\_drop of virtual and host network interfaces have been increased. Network traffic 100 times smaller can now be detected on network interface statistics.

If traffic on the network interface is below the precision of the network interface statistics, it is not reflected in the statistics. (BZ#1502510)

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1512365#c0)  Doran Moppert    2017-11-13 02:33:05 UTC  ``` It was discovered that with log level set to "DEBUG", ovirt-engine includes passwords in the log file without masking.  Note that only administrators can change the log level, and only administrators can access logs. This presents a risk when debug-level logs are shared with vendors etc to troubleshoot issues.  Upstream patch:  <https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-engine.git;a=commitdiff;h=f4a5d0cc772127dbfe40789e26c4633ceea07d14;hp=e6e8704ac9eb115624ff66e2965877d8e63a45f4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1512365#c1)  Doran Moppert    2017-11-13 02:33:16 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jiri Belka (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1512365#c2)  Doran Moppert    2017-11-13 02:50:12 UTC  ``` This was addressed in ovirt-engine-4.1.7.6-0.1:  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2017:3138](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2017%3A3138)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1512365#c4)  Doran Moppert    2017-11-15 08:34:33 UTC  ``` Created ovirt-engine tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1513331](show_bug.cgi?id=1513331 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-15113 ovirt-engine: DEBUG logging includes unmasked passwords [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
