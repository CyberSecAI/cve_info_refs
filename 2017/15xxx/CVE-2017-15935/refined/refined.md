The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Pandora FMS Enterprise version 7.0, including a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability which is associated with CVE-2017-15935.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application allows the inclusion of remote files due to vulnerable inclusion procedures. Specifically, the "manager files" function, intended for administrators, allows uploading files which can then be included through a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution on the web server.
- The attacker can gain a reverse shell on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a malicious PHP file containing code for system command execution through the "manager files" function.
- Triggering the inclusion of the uploaded file through a vulnerable part of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an administrator user to access the "manager files" function.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the server and trigger the inclusion of a malicious file.
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a reverse connection with the server to get a shell.
