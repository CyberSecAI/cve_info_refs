- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of parameter validation in the baseband modules of some Huawei smart phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform a denial of service attack or achieve remote code execution within the baseband module.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker within radio range can send specially crafted malicious packets to the vulnerable smartphone via a wireless device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within radio range of the targeted smartphone and possess a special wireless device to send malicious packets.
