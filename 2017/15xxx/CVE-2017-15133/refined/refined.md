{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the TCP serving code of miekg-dns.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way miekg-dns handles TCP connections. A small number of open TCP connections can completely block the DNS server from accepting new connections and answering TCP queries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending carefully timed TCP packets, which blocks the DNS server from processing new connections.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, using TCP packets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the vulnerable DNS server."
