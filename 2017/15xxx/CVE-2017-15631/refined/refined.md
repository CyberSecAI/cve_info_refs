Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-15631:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the `new-workmode` variable within the `pptp_client.lua` file. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`new-workmode` variable) in a system command without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the affected TP-Link router. This could lead to complete compromise of the device, including data theft, modification of configurations, and potentially using the router as a launchpad for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access (LAN/WAN):** The attack can be performed from the local network (LAN) or remotely via the WAN if the "remote management" feature is enabled on the router.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the web management interface of the router, specifically targeting the `pptp_client.lua` file and the vulnerable `new-workmode` variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials (username and password) for the router's web interface. This implies that an attacker must either guess, brute-force, or otherwise obtain legitimate credentials before exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content includes a list of other CVEs (CVE-2017-15613 to CVE-2017-15637) affecting various TP-Link router models, all related to similar command injection vulnerabilities in different lua files.
*   The provided PoC code targets CVE-2017-15616, but provides a good idea how the command injection occurs using a POST request. The same principle would apply for CVE-2017-15631, but with the different `new-workmode` variable and the `pptp_client.lua` file.
*   The affected TP-Link models are listed in the document.
*   The vendor confirmed and fixed the issues in all affected products.
