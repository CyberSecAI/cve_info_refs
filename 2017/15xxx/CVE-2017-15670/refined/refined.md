  "CVE-2017-15670": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability caused by an off-by-one error was found in glibc. It is possible that an attacker might use this to escalate his privileges or execute code.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one error in glibc's glob function when handling user names with the `~` operator with the GLOB_TILDE flag.  A one-byte overflow occurs.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "buffer overflow",
      "off-by-one error"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially escalate privileges or execute code by exploiting the buffer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by using an input string which uses the tilde operator and expands to a longer string than the allocated buffer during the glob function call."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the glob function and needs to use the GLOB_TILDE flag."
