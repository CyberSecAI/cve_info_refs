- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts in the `/principals` endpoint of Synology CardDAV Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of rate limiting or other measures to prevent brute-force attacks on user credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can obtain user credentials by repeatedly trying different usernames and passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system and potentially sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access to the vulnerable CardDAV Server endpoint (`/principals`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server over the network and requires no prior authentication.
