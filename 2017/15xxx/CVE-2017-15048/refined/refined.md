Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/opt/zoom/ZoomLauncher` binary in the Zoom Linux client is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs because the program concatenates user-supplied input to a stack variable without proper bounds checking. If the input is too long, it overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The core vulnerability is the lack of bounds checking when concatenating user input to a stack buffer using `strcat`.
*   **Missing security features:** The binary lacks important security mitigations such as stack canaries, which would help detect and prevent buffer overflows. This is confirmed by the `checksec` output which shows "Canary: No".
*   The binary is not compiled with PIE (Position Independent Executable), which would make exploitation harder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates a crash by overwriting the return address.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow, an attacker could overwrite the return address to redirect program execution to an attacker controlled location, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through the `zoommtg://` scheme handler registered by the client. This handler can be triggered by a malicious link in a web page or email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send or cause the user to process a specially crafted URL that leverages the `zoommtg://` handler. This can be achieved by tricking the user into visiting a webpage or clicking a malicious link in an email that contains the malicious `zoommtg://` URI.
*   The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the machine to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit example shows that a payload of 1048 bytes of 'A' followed by 8 bytes of 'B' will overwrite the return address on the stack.
*   The advisory includes a timeline of communication between the researchers and the vendor.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.115900.1201.

This analysis is consistent with the CVE description which states it is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The provided information gives specific details about the vulnerable code, how to trigger it, and the impact of successful exploitation.
