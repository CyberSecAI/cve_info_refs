Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15367:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in multiple PHP scripts within the Bacula-Web application. Specifically, user-supplied parameters are directly incorporated into SQL queries without validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application is vulnerable in multiple scripts, including `/jobs.php`, `/backupjob-report.php`, and `/client-report.php`. This occurs because the application uses user-provided parameters to construct SQL queries directly, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access the Bacula database. This database could contain sensitive information such as backup configurations, job details, and potentially other private data.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on database configuration, the attacker might be able to escalate privileges on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET requests:** The attack vectors are through crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts, such as `/jobs.php`, `/backupjob-report.php`, and `/client-report.php`.
*   **Manipulated URL parameters:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through URL parameters such as `status`, `level_id`, `client_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `orderby`, `jobs_per_page`, `pool_id`, and `period`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Bacula-Web instance.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit examples show how to use `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract the database version.
*   The fix involves updating to version 8.0.0-rc2, where input validation is implemented for the `period` parameter in `client-report.php`, as seen in the provided commit diff. This commit shows a fix in client-report.php, to ensure that a provided "period" parameter is a valid integer and a known value.
* The Exploit-DB entry highlights that multiple parameters across different scripts are vulnerable to SQL injection, not only the `period` parameter.

This information is more detailed than the initial CVE description, as it provides specific vulnerable scripts and parameters, as well as example exploit payloads.
