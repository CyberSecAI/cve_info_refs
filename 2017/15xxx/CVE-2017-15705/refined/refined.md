Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-15705 from the provided documents:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how SpamAssassin handles certain unclosed HTML tags within emails. The parser doesn't correctly process these malformed tags, leading to excessive processing time. Specifically, it fails to handle the "text" event and this may cause scan timeouts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper handling of malformed HTML: The HTML parser in SpamAssassin doesn't correctly manage unclosed tags, causing a parsing error. This leads to scan timeouts and resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): By sending specially crafted emails with unclosed tags, an attacker can cause SpamAssassin to consume significant processing resources. This can lead to scan timeouts and slow down or prevent the delivery of emails, thus a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote exploitation: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted emails to a vulnerable email server running SpamAssassin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a server that is running a vulnerable version of SpamAssassin. No special privileges are needed to perform the attack, other than sending an email.

**Additional technical details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how SpamAssassin hooks into the begin and end tag event handlers in `HTML::Parser`.
*   The "open" tag event is immediately followed by a "close" event, even if the tag doesn't close in the HTML being parsed.
*   This issue is possibly a bug or design decision in HTML::Parser, which impacts the way SpamAssassin uses the module with poorly formed HTML.

**Summary of relevant information from the documents:**

*   **Red Hat:** The vulnerability is identified as a denial-of-service issue caused by unclosed tags in crafted emails. The fix is included in security advisory RHSA-2018:2916.
*   **SUSE:**  SUSE also acknowledges the vulnerability and indicates it is resolved. SUSE's assessment of impact is slightly higher for Availability Impact than NVD scoring.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo identifies the issue as a DoS vulnerability stemming from malformed HTML and recommends upgrading to version 3.4.2-r2 or later.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu states that a remote attacker could cause a DoS by sending emails with unclosed tags. This vulnerability is fixed in USN-3811-1. USN-3811-2 addresses the same issue in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.
*   **openSUSE:**  openSUSE releases an update that addresses the issue, along with other security fixes.

All the content points to the vulnerability being triggered by malformed HTML and causing a denial-of-service condition due to resource exhaustion on the mail server. The patch generally involves upgrading to SpamAssassin version 3.4.2 or later.
