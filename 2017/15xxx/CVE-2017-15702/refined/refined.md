Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Qpid Broker-J handles authentication when multiple authentication providers are configured on different ports, including an HTTP port. The HTTP port can be tricked into using an authentication provider intended for a different port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended authentication provider on the HTTP port.
*   **Incorrect Authentication Handling:** The broker fails to correctly isolate authentication providers to their designated ports.
*   **Trust Boundary Violation:** The vulnerability allows for exploiting a potentially weaker authentication mechanism by misdirecting authentication requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the broker by leveraging a less secure authentication mechanism (e.g., anonymous access, default credentials) configured for a different port.
*   **Circumvention of Network Controls:** This can circumvent network-based security measures, as the attack occurs at the authentication level of the application, not at the network level.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With access to the broker, an attacker can potentially access or manipulate sensitive messaging data, depending on the access controls of the broker instance itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is conducted by sending specially crafted requests to the HTTP port of the broker.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need local access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the HTTP port of the Qpid Broker-J instance.
*   **Knowledge of Configured Providers:** The attacker needs to have knowledge (or be able to deduce) of the authentication providers that are in use, in order to take advantage of this vulnerability by targeting the weaker authentication provider.
*   **Valid Credentials (Targeted):** The attacker still needs valid credentials for the targeted (misused) authentication provider.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-15702 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Qpid Broker-J. By exploiting the weakness, an attacker can trick an HTTP port to use a weaker or less secure authentication method from another port. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access using valid credentials for an unintended provider. This is especially an issue where a weaker authentication provider is protected by other methods like firewall rules.

The vulnerability is present in Qpid Broker-J versions 0.18 through 0.32 and fixed in version 6.0.0. The recommendation is to update to the fixed version or remove the weaker authentication provider, or ensure that all the authentication providers offer the same level of protection.
