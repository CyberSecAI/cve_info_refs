- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of data, or complete control over the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `admin_process.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter. Specifically, the `act` parameter can be set to `vdoeditform` or `cateditform`, for example, in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
