Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user input within the SPIP web application. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where the lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts or HTML.
- **PHP Injection:** Additionally, the improper sanitization also leads to PHP injection vulnerabilities, allowing for execution of arbitrary server-side code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious web scripts or HTML, which can lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing other actions in the context of the victim's session.
- **PHP Injection:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to:
   - Data breaches/leaks.
   - Full compromise of the web server.
   - Potential for further attacks within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network without requiring physical access to the server.
- The vulnerability is related to how SPIP handles user input, indicating that the injection likely occurs through a web interface or parameters passed to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted inputs to the vulnerable SPIP application through a web interface or crafted web requests.
- No special privileges are mentioned in order to inject the code (i.e. it can be done by unauthenticated users in certain areas).
- The attacker does not require any specific position within the infrastructure, as the attack is launched remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in SPIP version 3.0.17-2+deb8u4 for Debian oldstable (jessie), and 3.1.4-4~deb9u1 for Debian stable (stretch).
- Ubuntu also patched this vulnerability, among others, in USN-4536-1.
- The fix involves sanitizing user input to prevent the injection of malicious code.
- The commit `a9989466` mentioned in the provided content appears to be related to a fix, which adds a `strict` argument to the `echapper_html_suspect` function, to avoid false positives. This suggests the vulnerability involved `meta+refresh` tags being used within article fields to inject malicious content and this commit is related to adding more robust sanitisation to the code.
