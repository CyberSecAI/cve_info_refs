Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-15049

**Root Cause:**
The Zoom client for Linux, specifically the `ZoomLauncher` binary, is vulnerable to command injection. The vulnerability occurs because the application uses user-controlled input to construct a shell command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into a shell command executed by the `ZoomLauncher` binary.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a system call, allowing for command injection.
- **Scheme Handler Misuse:** The client registers a custom URI scheme handler (`zoommtg://`). This handler can be exploited by an attacker to trigger the vulnerable code remotely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on a vulnerable system. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, data theft, installation of malware, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Custom URI Scheme:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `zoommtg://` URI scheme. An attacker could craft a malicious link or webpage that, when clicked, executes arbitrary commands.
- **Web Browser Exploitation:** A specially crafted HTML page containing the malicious `zoommtg://` link can be used to remotely exploit the vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the local network; they can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires some level of user interaction, as the victim needs to click on a malicious link or visit a webpage with the malicious `zoommtg://` scheme.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable Zoom client and its URI scheme handler.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `startZoom` function of the `ZoomLauncher` binary.
- The vulnerable code concatenates user-provided data with a fixed string to form a shell command.
- The concatenated command is then executed using the `system` function without proper sanitization.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates injecting a command via the `zoommtg://` URI handler, using `$()` to execute a shell command.
- The proof of concept uses  `zoommtg://$(gnome-calculator${IFS}-e${IFS}1337)` which when executed, will run the command `gnome-calculator -e 1337`.

**Affected Components:**

- Zoom client for Linux, version 2.0.106600.0904 (`zoom_amd64.deb`). Other versions may also be vulnerable.

**Solution:**

- Upgrade to the latest version of the Zoom client for Linux. Version 2.0.115900.1201 and later is said to resolve the issue.
