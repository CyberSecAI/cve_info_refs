Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15038:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the 9pfs (Plan 9 File System) implementation of QEMU when accessing extended attributes (xattrs). The vulnerability arises because the size of the extended attribute is queried first, and then memory is allocated using `g_malloc()`, before the value is retrieved. A race condition between these two operations could lead to the allocated memory not being zeroed before the attribute value is read into the buffer, potentially exposing the previous heap memory contents if not already zeroed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of uninitialized heap memory from the host system to the guest.
- Race Condition: The core issue is a race condition where the size and retrieval of xattr data is not atomic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious guest user can potentially read sensitive data that was previously stored in the heap memory on the host system.
- This could include confidential or sensitive information that is not supposed to be accessible by the guest.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a guest operating system using the 9pfs to access extended attributes of files on the host system.
- This means an attacker must have a user account inside a virtual machine to exploit this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have a user account inside a guest operating system running within QEMU.
- Attacker needs the ability to trigger the operations for reading extended attributes through the 9pfs.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix is to use `g_malloc0()` instead of `g_malloc()`. `g_malloc0()` allocates memory and also initializes it to zero, preventing the leak of potentially sensitive data that was previously in that memory.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tuomas Tynkkynen.
- The fix was applied to the `9p-next` branch of QEMU.
- Several sources confirm that this is an information disclosure vulnerability.
