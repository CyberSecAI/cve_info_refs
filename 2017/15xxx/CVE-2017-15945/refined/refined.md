Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure use of the `chown` command within the Gentoo installation scripts of MariaDB and MySQL. Specifically, the scripts were using `chown` on user-writable directory trees during the installation process. This allowed a local user with access to the `mysql` account to manipulate file ownership.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure use of `chown`:** The primary vulnerability lies in the `chown` calls within the installation scripts that operate on the live root filesystem. Specifically, non-recursive calls to `chown` could be subverted by symlinks, while recursive `chown -R` calls were vulnerable to hard links.
*   **Race Condition:** A race condition existed between the execution of the `mysql_install_db` script and the subsequent `chown -R` command. This allowed an attacker to create a hard link within the data directory after the script created initial files, but before the `chown -R` command was executed, thus changing the ownership of the attacker's link target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with access to the `mysql` user account could exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges. By manipulating file ownership using symlinks or hard links, the attacker could take control of arbitrary files, including those required for system operation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system and have some level of access with the `mysql` user.
*   **Symlink/Hard Link Manipulation:** The attacker needs to create a symbolic or hard link within directories targeted by the vulnerable `chown` commands. This requires some understanding of the timing and file system operations during the installation/configuration process.
* **Race Condition Exploitation**: During the `pkg_config` phase, a race condition allowed an attacker to create a hard link in `MY_DATADIR` after the `mysql_install_db` script created files, but before the subsequent `chown -R` command executed, granting the attacker ownership of the linked target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system.
*   **Access to the `mysql` User:** Critically, the attacker must have some form of access to the `mysql` user account or some way of executing commands as that user.
*   **Knowledge of Installation Process:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how the MariaDB/MySQL installation scripts work, particularly where `chown` commands are used and the timing/race condition involved.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability existed in multiple versions of `dev-db/mariadb`, `dev-db/mysql`, `dev-db/percona-server`, `dev-db/mysql-cluster`, and `dev-db/mariadb-galera` packages on Gentoo.
*   The issue was resolved by removing the vulnerable `chown` commands, and using `chgrp` on specific directories after initial file creation during package configuration.
*   The fix required users to upgrade to the latest versions of the affected packages or, if no newer version was available, reinstall the package manually. This ensured that the cached, vulnerable eclasses were replaced with fixed versions.
* The vulnerability was not easily exploitable in a default setup, as it required access to the mysql user. A plausible scenario would involve a pre-existing compromised mysql installation.
