X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2017-006

# Multiple Vulnerabilities in PSFTPd Windows FTP Server

## Overview

**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 10.0.4 Build 729

**Confirmed Patched Versions:** None

**Vendor:** Sergei Pleis Softwareentwicklung

**Vendor URL:** https://www.psftp.de/ftp-server/

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Eric Sesterhenn, Markus Vervier

**Status:** Public

**Advisory-URL:** https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2017-006-psftpd/

## Summary and Impact

Several issues have been identified, which allow attackers to hide information in log files, recover passwords and crash the whole server.

It uses neither ASLR nor DEP to make exploitation harder.

## Product Description

From the vendor page, roughly translated:

PSFTPd is a userfriendly, functional and robust FTP server software with support for FTP, FTPS and SFTP.

# Use after free

**Severity Rating:** High

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-15271

**CWE:** 416

**CVSS Score:** 7.5

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

## Summary and Impact

An invalid memory access issue could be triggered remotely in the SFTP component of PSFTPd. This issue could be triggered prior authentication. The PSFTPd server did not automatically restart, which enabled attackers to perform a very effective DoS attack against this service. By sending the following SSH identification / version string to the server, a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered:

```

$ cat tmp.14
SSH-2.0-BBBBBBBB
CCCCCCCCCCCC

$ cat tmp.14 | socat - TCP:192.168.122.50:22
```

The issue appears to be a race condition in the window message handling, performing the cleanup for invalid connections. Upon further investigation X41 D-Sec GmbH could confirm that the accessed memory was already freed.

X41 D-Sec GmbH enabled the memory debugging functionality page heap for the psftpd\_svc.exe exeutable using the command âgflags.exe /p /disable psftpd\_svc.exe /fullâ. When observing the crash in the WinDBG 19 debugging tool, it could be confirmed that access to an already freed page was taking place.

# Log Injection

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-15270

**CWE:** 117

**CVSS Score:** 5.3

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

## Summary and Impact

The PSFTPd server does not properly escape data before writing it into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. This can be used by attackers to hide data in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) view and create arbitrary entries to a certain extent. Special characters as âââ, â,â and â\râ are not escaped and can be used to add new entries to the log.

## Workarounds

None

# Passwords stored in Plain Text

**Severity Rating:** Low
**Vector:** Local
**CVE:** CVE-2017-15272
**CWE:** 312
**CVSS Score:** 3.3
**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

## Summary and Impact

The PSFTPd server stores its configuration inside the PSFTPd.dat. This file is a Microsoft Access Database and can be extracted by using the command âmdb-export PSFTPd.dat USERSâ from mdbtools (https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools). The application sets the encrypt flag with the password âITsILLEGALâ, but this is not required to extract the data. The users password is shown in clear text, since it is not stored securely.

## Workarounds

Use the Active Directory connector for your users.

# FTP Bounce Scan

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-15269

**CWE:** 441

**CVSS Score:** 5.0

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

## Summary and Impact

The PSFTPd server does not prevent FTP bounce scans by default. These can be performed using ânmap -bâ and allow to perform scans via the FTP server.

## Workarounds

It is possible to prevent FTP bounce scans by setting: Kontrollmanager > Domain > Sicherheit > Register âFTP Bounce and FXPâ

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
