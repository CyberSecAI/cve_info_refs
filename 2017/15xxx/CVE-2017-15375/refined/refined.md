- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `query` and `id` parameters of several modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the `wpjb-email`, `wpjb-job`, `wpjb-application`, and `wpjb-membership` modules.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious script code into the client-side browser. This can lead to session hijacking, phishing attacks, redirection to malicious sites, and manipulation of web module contexts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and uses HTTP GET requests. The vulnerable parameters are `query` and `id`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need a privileged user account, and only requires low user interaction.
