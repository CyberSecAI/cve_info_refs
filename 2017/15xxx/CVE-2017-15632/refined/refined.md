```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in multiple Lua files within the TP-Link router's firmware. Specifically, user-supplied input is passed to shell commands without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection (Authenticated)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router, potentially gaining full control of the device. This can lead to data breaches, denial of service, or the router being used as part of a botnet.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web management interface of the TP-Link router. An attacker with valid credentials can send specially crafted HTTP POST requests to vulnerable Lua files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials for the router's web management interface. The attacker can be on the LAN, or WAN if the 'remote management' feature is enabled."
