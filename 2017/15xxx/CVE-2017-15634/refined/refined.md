{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the 'wportal.lua' file. Specifically, the 'name' variable, which is passed via a POST request, is not properly sanitized before being used in a command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-supplied input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the web management interface of the router.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials for the router's web management panel, meaning they must be an authenticated user. The attack can be launched from either the LAN or WAN side if remote management is enabled."
