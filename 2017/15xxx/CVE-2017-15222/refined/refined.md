Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the Ayukov NFTP FTP client. This occurs when the client receives a response to the `SYST` command with a long string of data exceeding the buffer's capacity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The application does not properly validate the size of the data received in response to the SYST command, allowing an attacker to overwrite the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful overflow will cause the FTP client to crash due to overwriting critical data on the stack.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and redirect execution flow to attacker-controlled shellcode, leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the FTP client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sets up a malicious FTP server that responds to the client's `SYST` command with an overly long string.
- The vulnerable FTP client connects to the malicious server.
- When the client sends the `SYST` command, the malicious server responds with a crafted payload triggering the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a rogue FTP server accessible by the vulnerable client.
- The attacker must be able to intercept the vulnerable client's initial `SYST` command request and reply with the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided exploits include Metasploit module and standalone Python scripts.
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Ayukov NFTP FTP client prior to 2.0.
- Some exploits use a `call esp` instruction to redirect execution to the payload, while others overwrite EIP directly.
- The exploits include a shellcode payload designed to either bind a shell or execute calc.exe, demonstrating code execution capability.
- The exploit from EDB-ID 46070 describes the vulnerability as a local exploit, which seems incorrect based on the context of the vulnerability. All the other documents refer to it as a remote vulnerability.
