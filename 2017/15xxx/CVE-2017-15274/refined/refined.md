Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-15274:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Linux kernel's key management subsystem handles payloads during key creation and updates. Specifically, the `sys_add_key()` system call and the `KEYCTL_UPDATE` operation of `sys_keyctl()` allowed a NULL payload with a non-zero length to be passed to key type methods such as `->preparse()`, `->instantiate()`, or `->update()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is the potential for a NULL pointer dereference. When a NULL payload is provided along with a non-zero length, the kernel attempts to access the data pointed to by the (NULL) payload, resulting in a crash.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The kernel failed to properly validate the relationship between the payload pointer and its specified length. It was checking if `_payload` was non-NULL instead of checking if `plen` was non-zero before accessing memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged user can trigger a kernel oops (crash) by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Potential Code Execution (Unlikely):** Although primarily a DoS, the possibility of code execution could not be completely ruled out in the original reports because the vulnerability involves memory access violations. This was later determined to be unlikely.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users who can use system calls like `add_key` or `keyctl_update`
*   **Crafted Payloads:** Attackers need to craft a specific system call using a NULL payload with a specified non-zero length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system to make the vulnerable system calls.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user on the system.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Key Types:** Key types vulnerable include `asymmetric`, `cifs.idmap`, `cifs.spnego`, and `pkcs7_test` (and possibly others).
*   **Patch Mechanism:** The fix involves checking if the payload length (`plen`) is non-zero, instead of just checking if the payload pointer (`_payload`) is not NULL. This ensures that `copy_from_user()` is only called when a valid buffer is expected, preventing the null pointer dereference.
* The fix ensures that the syscall will fail with EFAULT as expected when an invalid buffer is specified

**Summary**
The CVE-2017-15274 vulnerability in the Linux kernel's key management subsystem allowed unprivileged local users to trigger a kernel crash via a NULL pointer dereference by supplying a NULL payload with non-zero length in a system call. The vulnerability was resolved by implementing proper checks based on the provided length during payload copying.
