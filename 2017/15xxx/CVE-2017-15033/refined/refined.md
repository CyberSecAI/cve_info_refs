The provided content is related to CVE-2017-15033.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of malformed image files within ImageMagick, specifically a memory leak issue in `ReadYUVImage` function, leading to resource exhaustion and potential code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in `ReadYUVImage` when a file fails to open
- Improper cleanup of allocated memory `scanline` in multiple error handling code paths within the function

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by exhausting resources.
- Potential code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker tricks a user or an automated system using ImageMagick into opening a specially crafted malformed image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a malformed image file that triggers the vulnerability.
- Ability to deliver or convince the victim to process the crafted image file with ImageMagick
