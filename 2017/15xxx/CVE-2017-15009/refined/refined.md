The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in PRTG Network Manager, and CVE-2017-15009 is listed as one of the CVEs related to the article.

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `error.htm` page is vulnerable, specifically through the `errormsg` parameter passed via GET. The application does not properly sanitize URL-encoded scripts.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation on the `errormsg` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser when the user accesses a crafted URL. This can lead to session hijacking via cookie theft by sending sessionIDs to a remote server controlled by the attacker
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted URL containing malicious script to a PRTG user.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities**: Requires social engineering to get a user to interact with the crafted URL.

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Sensor Titles:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize HTML-encoded input in sensor titles. The vulnerability is triggered when hovering over a sensor, which renders a tooltip that interprets the malicious payload.
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization on the sensor title field and vulnerable tooltip rendering.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker with write permissions can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browser of any user viewing the sensor.  This can lead to session hijacking.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An authenticated user with write access to sensors can input a malicious payload in the sensor title.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an attacker to be authenticated with write permissions to sensor configurations

*  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Group Names:**
    * **Root Cause:** Similar to the sensor title vulnerability, HTML-encoded payloads in group names are not sanitized. The vulnerability is triggered by hovering over the group name, which renders a tooltip.
    * **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization on the group name field and vulnerable tooltip rendering.
    * **Impact:** An attacker with write permissions to create/modify groups can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browser of any user viewing the group. This could lead to session hijacking.
    * **Attack Vector:** An authenticated user with write access to groups can inject a malicious payload in the group name.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an attacker to be authenticated with write permissions to group configurations

*   **File Upload Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Although the server returns an error message for invalid file types, the uploaded files are still stored on the server.
    *   **Weakness:**  Inadequate server-side validation and file handling.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker who manages to upload a malicious executable file could compromise the server if the admin executes this file.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads a malicious file through the file upload functionality.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to the file upload function. Requires the admin to execute the file after upload.

*   **Access Control Flaw leading to map creation with read-only user:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows a read-only user to create a map by forging a map creation request even though it generates an error message.
    *  **Weakness:** Inadequate access control and server-side validation.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can create maps even without the right permissions, which combined with other vulnerabilities like file upload, could be a bigger issue.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Forging a map creation request as a read-only user.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a read-only user account.
