Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-15960:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the Article Directory Script 3.0. This occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL code into the application's queries.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:**  The provided exploit details that both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques are applicable.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   They can retrieve sensitive information like user credentials, database structure, or even manipulate data within the database.
    *  Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the application and its data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameters `id` in the `category.php` and `author.php` files.
    *   The vulnerable parameters are directly accessible via web browser requests.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is accessible by any user who can access the web application.
    *   The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the vulnerable server, meaning this is a remote attack vector.

**Summary of Exploitation:**
The attacker can inject SQL commands into the `id` parameter of the `category.php` and `author.php` scripts. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to use techniques such as `UNION SELECT`, `CONCAT_WS`, `SLEEP()` to extract information and verify the vulnerability. Both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
