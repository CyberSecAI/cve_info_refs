# QEMU - NBD Server Long Export Name Stack Buffer Overflow

#### EDB-ID:

###### 43194

#### CVE:

###### [2017-15118](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15118)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Eric Blake](/?author=9179)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Linux](/?platform=linux)

#### Date:

###### 2017-11-29

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Introduced in commit f37708f6b8 (2.10).  The NBD spec says a client
can request export names up to 4096 bytes in length, even though
they should not expect success on names longer than 256.  However,
qemu hard-codes the limit of 256, and fails to filter out a client
that probes for a longer name; the result is a stack smash that can
potentially give an attacker arbitrary control over the qemu
process.

The smash can be easily demonstrated with this client:

$ qemu-io f raw nbd://localhost:10809/$(printf %3000d 1 | tr ' ' a)

If the qemu NBD server binary (whether the standalone qemu-nbd, or
the builtin server of QMP nbd-server-start) was compiled with
-fstack-protector-strong, the ability to exploit the stack smash
into arbitrary execution is a lot more difficult (but still
theoretically possible to a determined attacker, perhaps in
combination with other CVEs).  Still, crashing a running qemu (and
losing the VM) is bad enough, even if the attacker did not obtain
full execution control.

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## [Qemu-devel] [PULL 2/2] nbd/server: CVE-2017-15118 Stack smash on large

```
Introduced in commit f37708f6b8 (2.10).  The NBD spec says a client
can request export names up to 4096 bytes in length, even though
they should not expect success on names longer than 256.  However,
qemu hard-codes the limit of 256, and fails to filter out a client
that probes for a longer name; the result is a stack smash that can
potentially give an attacker arbitrary control over the qemu
process.

The smash can be easily demonstrated with this client:
$ qemu-io f raw nbd://localhost:10809/$(printf %3000d 1 | tr ' ' a)

If the qemu NBD server binary (whether the standalone qemu-nbd, or
the builtin server of QMP nbd-server-start) was compiled with
-fstack-protector-strong, the ability to exploit the stack smash
into arbitrary execution is a lot more difficult (but still
theoretically possible to a determined attacker, perhaps in
combination with other CVEs).  Still, crashing a running qemu (and
losing the VM) is bad enough, even if the attacker did not obtain
full execution control.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.10.0). (BZ#1470749)

Security Fix(es):

* Qemu: stack buffer overflow in NBD server triggered via long export name (CVE-2017-15118)
* Qemu: DoS via large option request (CVE-2017-15119)
* Qemu: vga: OOB read access during display update (CVE-2017-13672)
* Qemu: vga: reachable assert failure during display update (CVE-2017-13673)
* Qemu: Slirp: use-after-free when sending response (CVE-2017-13711)
* Qemu: memory exhaustion through framebuffer update request message in VNC server (CVE-2017-15124)
* Qemu: I/O: potential memory exhaustion via websock connection to VNC (CVE-2017-15268)
* Qemu: Out-of-bounds read in vga\_draw\_text routine (CVE-2018-5683)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank David Buchanan for reporting CVE-2017-13672 and CVE-2017-13673; Wjjzhang (Tencent.com) for reporting CVE-2017-13711; and Jiang Xin and Lin ZheCheng for reporting CVE-2018-5683. The CVE-2017-15118 and CVE-2017-15119 issues were discovered by Eric Blake (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-15124 issue was discovered by Daniel Berrange (Red Hat).

Subject: CVE-2017-15118 Qemu: stack buffer overflow in NBD server triggered
 via long export name

   Hello,

A stack based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in NBD server
implementation in Qemu allowing client to request an export name of size up to
4096 bytes, which in fact should be limited to 256 bytes, allowing to cause
out-of-bounds stack write in Qemu process.

If NBD server requires TLS, the attacker cannot trigger the buffer overflow
without first successfully negotiating TLS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-11/msg05045.html>

Reference:

   -><https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1516922>

Thank you.
