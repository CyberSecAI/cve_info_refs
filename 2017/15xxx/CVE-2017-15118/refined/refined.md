  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The NBD server in QEMU allows clients to request an export name up to 4096 bytes, while the code has a hardcoded limit of 256 bytes. This discrepancy leads to a stack buffer overflow when a client sends a name longer than 256 bytes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.",
        "Hardcoded size limit not enforced."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit can result in a crash of the QEMU process, causing a denial of service. It could also lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker is able to carefully craft the overflow data.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted, large option request to the NBD server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the NBD server."
