Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw located in the `pptp_server.lua` file. Specifically, the `new-enable` variable within this file is vulnerable to command injection. The lua script doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the lua scripts. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands via the `new-enable` parameter when a POST request to the web management panel is made.
- **Authenticated Access Required:** The attack requires an attacker to have valid administrator credentials to access the router's web management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected TP-Link router. This can lead to:
    - **Full Control of the Router:** The attacker can take complete control of the device.
    - **Network Compromise:** Compromised devices can be used to pivot into the local network or participate in botnets.
    - **Data Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive data stored on the router.
    - **Denial of Service:** The router could be made inoperable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the router's web management interface by sending a malicious POST request.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router, either through the LAN or WAN if remote management is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must possess valid administrative credentials for the router's web interface. This may be gained through a separate vulnerability, social engineering or brute force attacks.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have access via remote management.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to construct and send a specifically crafted HTTP POST request containing the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided document lists a range of TP-Link models, including WVR, WAR, and ER series that are affected. The detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) provided in the document uses `CVE-2017-15616` as an example, but explains that the other vulnerabilities are similar. The PoC shows how to authenticate and send the malicious request using Python and the requests library. The document specifically states that `CVE-2017-15623` is triggered by the `new-enable` variable in the `pptp_server.lua` file, which is consistent with the general description of the vulnerability in other files. The specific PoC payload in the document opens the telnet service, but any arbitrary command can be executed.
