Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15572:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Redmine handles redirects after a lost password request. Specifically, the /account/lost_password action was not redirecting, potentially leaking password reset tokens in the referer header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the potential exposure of password reset tokens through the HTTP referer header. When a user requests a password reset, the token is included in the URL. If the application does not redirect after password reset token is generated, this token could be exposed to external sites if the user navigates away from the password reset page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain access to a user's account by intercepting the password reset token. This is because the referer header may contain the URL which include password reset token.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Referer Header Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially trick the user into visiting a malicious site that logs referer headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or Malicious Website:** The attacker would need to either intercept network traffic (MITM) to see the referer header, or trick a user into clicking a link on a malicious website, which can then read the referer header containing the password reset token.
