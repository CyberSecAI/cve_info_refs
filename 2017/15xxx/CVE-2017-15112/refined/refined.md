Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `keycloak-httpd-client-install` tool allowing the administrator password to be passed directly as a command-line argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Password Handling:** Passing the password as a command-line argument exposes it in command history and process information, making it visible to other local users.
- **Lack of Secure Input Method:** The tool initially lacked a secure way to input the password, forcing users to use the command line.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Local users with access to the command history or process information could obtain the administrator password, potentially granting them unauthorized access to the Keycloak server and its resources.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If a less privileged user obtains the administrator password, they could escalate their privileges within the Keycloak environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** Attackers need local access to the system where the `keycloak-httpd-client-install` command was executed.
- **Command History:** Attackers can view the command history of the user who executed the command.
- **Process Information:** Attackers can potentially view the command-line arguments of the running process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local user access to the system.
- The attacker must have some basic knowledge of how to access command history or process information.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by updating the tool to version 0.8, which includes:
- **Password File Input:** Introduction of the `--keycloak-admin-password-file` option, which allows reading the password from a file or stdin (using "-").
- **Environment Variable Support:** Added support for the `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- **Deprecation of Command-Line Password:** The direct use of the `-p/--admin-password` option for specifying the password was deprecated (it only allows reading from stdin during a transition period).
- **Clear documentation in man page** to explain the issue and new best practices.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity by Red Hat, despite GitHub categorizing it as "High".
- CVSS v3 score is 7.8 with AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The fix is part of the `keycloak-httpd-client-install-0.8-1.el7` package and was released in RHSA-2019:2137.
