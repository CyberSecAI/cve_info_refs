{
  "CVE-2017-15129": {
    "description": "It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "The function get_net_ns_by_id() does not check for the net::count value after it has found a peer network in netns_ids idr which could lead to double free and memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Double-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code; kernel memory corruption leading to a crash, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "local access"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel since v4.0-rc1 through v4.15-rc5. The affected code exists in the  get_net_ns_by_id() function which has a race condition leading to a use-after-free."
