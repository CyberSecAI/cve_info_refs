- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A malformed RTSP packet can cause a crash in the RTSP dissector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The RTSP dissector in Wireshark versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.1 is vulnerable to a crash due to a malformed packet.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash by injecting a malformed packet or convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file.
- **Attack vectors**: Malformed network packets or malformed packet trace files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can either inject packets onto the network or provide a malformed file to a user.
