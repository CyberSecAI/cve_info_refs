{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-15111",
    "description": "keycloak-httpd-client-install versions before 0.8 insecurely creates temporary file allowing local attackers to overwrite other files via symbolic link.",
    "affected_versions": "< 0.8",
    "patched_versions": "0.8",
    "root_cause": "The keycloak-httpd-client-install tool, specifically the `keycloak_cli.py` script, was creating log files in the `/tmp` directory with predictable names derived from the script's name.  This default log file location and the predictable naming scheme allows for a symlink attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-59"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could create a symbolic link to a sensitive location, possibly causing data corruption or denial of service. The attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on the system by creating a symbolic link with the same name as the predictable log file.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory, which requires low privileges. The attacker must also know or guess the program name.",
    "cvss_v3": {
      "attack_vector": "Local",
      "attack_complexity": "Low",
      "privileges_required": "Low",
      "user_interaction": "None",
      "scope": "Unchanged",
      "confidentiality": "None",
      "integrity": "High",
      "availability": "None",
      "base_score": 5.5
    },
        "remediation": "The vulnerability was fixed by changing the default log file location from `/tmp/{prog_name}.log` to `{prog_name}.log`, so the log file is created in the current directory. The fix was included in version 0.8 of keycloak-httpd-client-install.",
