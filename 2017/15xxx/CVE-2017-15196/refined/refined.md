Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper authorization checks in the Kanboard application. Specifically, the application was not verifying if an authenticated user had the necessary permissions to modify resources associated with a project. This allowed users to manipulate form data to perform actions on projects they did not own or have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application was using the `id` parameter in the forms to directly access and modify resources (projects, tasks, comments, etc.). By altering these IDs in the form data, an attacker could target resources they were not authorized to access.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application was not consistently checking if the currently logged-in user was authorized to perform the requested operation on the targeted resource. This missing check allowed authenticated users to bypass access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities would lead to:

*   **Unauthorized Access and Modification:** Authenticated users could access and modify sensitive information belonging to other users' private projects.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Attackers could add, modify, or delete data within private projects, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not a privilege escalation in the sense of obtaining higher privileges, the ability to manipulate other users' projects is a form of privilege escalation within the application's context.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could at least view the name of tags, and download attachments from private projects of other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Data Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves intercepting and modifying HTTP requests (specifically form data) sent to the server. Attackers could change parameters such as project IDs, task IDs, etc., to point to resources they are not authorized to access.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerabilities were exploited via the web application's forms and HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Kanboard application.
*   **Knowledge of IDs:** The attacker would need to know or guess the IDs of other users' projects and resources in order to target them.
*   **Ability to Intercept HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to modify HTTP requests before they reach the server. This could be done with browser plugins or web proxies.
