{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Command injection vulnerability exists in multiple lua files due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in POST requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers, who have obtained valid administrator credentials, can execute arbitrary commands on the affected TP-Link devices. This allows for complete control over the device and potential compromise of the network.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through HTTP POST requests to the web management interface. Specifically, the attacker needs to send a crafted POST request containing the malicious payload to one of the vulnerable lua files via the web management panel.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to the web management interface of the TP-Link device. This can be achieved by obtaining the valid credentials through phishing or other social engineering attacks."
