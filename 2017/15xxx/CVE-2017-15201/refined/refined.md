Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper authorization checks in Kanboard versions 1.0.46 and earlier. Authenticated users were able to manipulate form data to access and modify resources (projects, tasks, etc.) that they did not have permissions for. This was due to the application not verifying if the user had the rights to modify the specific project ID included in the form data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application was using object IDs directly from user input in form data to perform operations, without sufficient validation against the userâ€™s permissions. This allowed an attacker to modify another user's project by changing the project ID in form data.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application lacked proper checks to ensure that the user performing an action was authorized to do so on the target resource. This was true for actions such as editing project details, adding tasks, modifying columns, etc.
*   **Exposed IDs in Forms:** The application was exposing object IDs directly in forms, which allowed for easier manipulation by an attacker.
*   **CSRF vulnerability**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability descriptions, there was a related CSRF vulnerability. This means that an attacker might be able to get a victim user to perform an unauthorized action on the application without the user's consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could:

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gain unauthorized access to private projects of other users.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Modify project details (name, email, description, etc.), add or edit tasks, columns, categories, swimlanes, tags, and actions within private projects.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Access and download attachments from private projects.
*   **Data Exposure:** View thumbnails of pictures from private projects, and view the names of tags from private projects.
*   **Data Deletion:** Remove columns, categories, automatic actions, and attachments from private projects.
*   **Data Insertion:** Add external and internal links to private projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Data Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves altering the form data submitted to the server. This includes changing project IDs, task IDs, and other resource IDs to perform actions on unauthorized resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Kanboard application.
*   **Knowledge of application workings**: The attacker should know the application's API endpoints and expected form data structure
*   **Ability to manipulate HTTP requests**: The attacker should be capable of intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests.

**Additional details found:**

* The fixes involved adding checks in the BaseController to verify that the project ID from the form data matches the project ID associated with the resource that is being accessed.  This prevents users from accessing private resources of other projects
* The fix also removes IDs from form elements.

The identified issues are fixed in Kanboard version 1.0.47.
