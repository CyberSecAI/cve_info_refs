Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control checks in Kanboard. Specifically, the application relies on user-supplied form data for determining the context of operations (e.g., which project a task belongs to). The application fails to verify if an authenticated user has the required permissions to modify or view resources associated with another user's private projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application directly uses user-provided IDs for accessing project-related data, leading to IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** There's insufficient authorization checks before performing actions on projects, tasks, files and other entities. This enables users to bypass intended access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can perform the following actions on private projects of other users by manipulating form data:

*   Edit project details (name, description, etc.)
*   Add, edit and remove tasks.
*   Add, edit and remove project columns and categories.
*   Edit swimlanes and tags.
*   Add and remove automatic actions.
*   Download attachments and view thumbnails.
*   Add external and internal links to private projects.
*   Remove attachments.
*   See the names of tags of private projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through manipulating HTTP POST form data. An authenticated user can modify the `project_id`, `task_id`, `file_id` and other parameters to target resources associated with another user's private projects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Kanboard application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to modify HTTP POST parameters sent to the application.

**Additional details:**

The provided content lists multiple specific instances of this general vulnerability with actions like adding tasks, modifying columns, categories, etc. The vulnerabilities are fixed by commits: `074f6c104f3e49401ef0065540338fc2d4be79f0`, `3e0f14ae2b0b5a44bd038a472f17eac75f538524` and `7100f6de8a1f566e260b3e65312767e4cde112b1`.  The fix implemented in commit `7100f6de8a1f566e260b3e65312767e4cde112b1` specifically addresses the file access issues, by verifying if the file's project and task ID match what the user requested.
