- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of packets in the H323 protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could cause a memory leak and eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted packets to the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated, remote attacker with network access.
