Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-15971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to SQL injection flaws in the "Same Sex Dating Software Pro 1.0" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `profid` parameter in `viewprofile.php` and the `sender_id` parameter in `viewmessage.php`. Additionally, an SQL injection vulnerability is present in the admin login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database.
- This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive information from the database).
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data in the database).
    - Potential full compromise of the database server depending on the database privileges of the user the application is using.
    - Authentication bypass by injecting `or 1=1` into the login page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vectors are through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP pages:
    - `http://localhost/[PATH]/viewprofile.php?profid=[SQL]`
    - `http://localhost/[PATH]/viewmessage.php?sender_id=[SQL]`
- SQL injection on admin login page by injecting `'or 1=1 or ''='` as email address

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, suggesting that anyone can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to know the application's URL and the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit information demonstrates SQL injection using a `UNION SELECT` query.
- It shows a method to enumerate database information using `information_schema` and `Export_Set` functions.
- The exploit also notes a SQL injection point within the admin login, allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication.
- The application is a PHP-based web application.
