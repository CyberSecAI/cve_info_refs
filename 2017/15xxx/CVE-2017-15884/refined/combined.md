#### EDB-ID:

###### [2017-15884](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15884)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
# After three CVEs and multiple exploits disclosed to Hashicorp they have finally upped their game with this plugin. Now the previously vulnerable non-root-owned
# ruby code that get executed as root by the sudo helper is no more and the sudo helper itself is one static Go binary with tightly-controlled parameters that
# can't (as far as I can tell) be exploited on its own.

# However I have discovered that the update mechanism in 5.0.0 is not completely safe. There is a bug in the update mechanism for 5.0.0 that makes it reinstall
# the plugin when you run:

# $ vagrant plugin update

# even if there is no update pending. The reinstall includes replacing the sudo helper and re-applying root ownership and the suid bit. This is done via
# osascript with a block of shell as an easy way to show a graphical popup authentication dialog to the user.

# After the credentials are entered and the permissions are applied the installer for the plugin immediately checks the hash of the sudo helper binary and if it
# doesn't match it removes it. On the surface this seemed to make a race condition impossible however after some poking around I found a way to exploit it.

# Because the authentication prompt is a guarantee of at least a few seconds pause in the intallation, we can catch this point in time very easily by scanning the
# process list watching for the invocation of osascript. Once we see this we can lay a trap by replacing the sudo helper binary with an exploit payload (remember
# this is always in a non-root-owned directory).

# As soon as the privileges are set vagrant will execute its checksum and remove the payload, however because we've caught execution at the right time and
# because the installer is a different process from the osascript process we can send a STOP signal to the installer to pause its execution. This means osascript
# will set the permissions and then the installer will not immediately remove the binary, giving us time to move our newly suid-root'd payload out of the way, use
# it to obtain root privileges, and then move the real sudo helper back into place and chmod +s it ourselves so that vagrant doesn't realise anything bad has
# happened.

# This all takes place in a second or two so the user is unlikely to notice either. Once this is done we simply send a CONT signal to the installer to allow
# it to continue as normal. The plugin is installed correctly with the right permissions, the user didn't see any errors or warnings, and we have an suid
# root payload that we can execute to spawn a root shell.

# This issue is fixed in version 5.0.1.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
