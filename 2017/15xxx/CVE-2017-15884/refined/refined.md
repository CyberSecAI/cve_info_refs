- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The update mechanism in `vagrant-vmware-fusion 5.0.0` reinstalls the plugin, including replacing the sudo helper binary, even when no update is pending. This reinstall process involves using `osascript` to show a graphical authentication dialog for applying root permissions to the helper. A race condition exists because after authentication, the installer checks the hash of the helper binary, but this check can be bypassed by replacing the binary just after root permissions are set but before the hash check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Race condition: The time between the `osascript` setting permissions and the installer checking the sudo helper's hash is vulnerable to manipulation.
    - Unprotected helper binary: The helper binary, while intended to be protected, is located in a non-root-owned directory, allowing for its replacement during the vulnerability window.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows for local privilege escalation, resulting in a root shell.
- **Attack vectors**: 
   - The attack is triggered by running `vagrant plugin update`, even when no update is needed.
    - The exploit involves monitoring for the `osascript` invocation, replacing the sudo helper binary with a malicious payload, pausing the installer process with `STOP` signal, waiting for the payload to gain suid root permissions, executing the payload to get a root shell, moving the original helper back into place, fixing its permissions, and then resuming the installer process with a `CONT` signal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
   - The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable `vagrant-vmware-fusion` plugin is installed.
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute commands and monitor processes to exploit the race condition.
