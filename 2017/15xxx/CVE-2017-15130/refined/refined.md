    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacker using randomly generated SNI server names."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to establish TLS connections to the Dovecot server and generate random SNI server names. This vulnerability only affects Dovecot configurations that include `local_name { }` or `local { }` configuration blocks."
