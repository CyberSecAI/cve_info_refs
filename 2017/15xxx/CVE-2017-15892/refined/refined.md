- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the Slash Command Creator feature of Synology Chat.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS vulnerabilities in the Slash Command Creator, specifically through the COMMAND, COMMANDS INSTRUCTION, and DESCRIPTION parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML code into the application. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks targeting other users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out remotely over the network by a user who has already been authenticated to the Synology Chat application. The attacker injects malicious script or HTML code through the vulnerable parameters in the Slash Command Creator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a remote authenticated user, and must be able to access the Slash Command Creator feature within the Synology Chat application. The attacker needs to manipulate specific parameters like COMMAND, COMMANDS INSTRUCTION, or DESCRIPTION to inject the malicious code.
