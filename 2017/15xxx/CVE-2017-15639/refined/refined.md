```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application makes an HTTP request based on user-supplied input and passes the response directly to XmlParse().",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "XML External Entity Injection (XXE)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause the application to make arbitrary HTTP requests (SSRF). Additionally, using XXE, an attacker can read files from the server's file system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious XML payload and providing it through the 'rssurl' parameter in the `readRSS.cfm` file, an attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the vulnerable Mura CMS instance. They also need to be able to set up a web server to host a malicious XML file."
