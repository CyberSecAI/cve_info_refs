Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15108:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `spice-vdagent` not properly escaping the save directory before passing it to the shell. Specifically, the `vdagent_file_xfers_data` function in `file-xfers.c` constructs a command using `snprintf` that includes the `save_dir` variable without proper sanitization. This command is then executed via `system()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Because the `save_dir` is not properly escaped before being passed to `system()`, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious directory name.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the contents of the `save_dir` variable before using it in a shell command.
- **Insecure Function Usage:** The usage of `system()` makes the application vulnerable to shell injection.
- **Insufficient Error Handling:** The original code uses `snprintf` which can cause issues if the `save_dir` is too long leading to missing characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker, who has access to the user session where the `spice-vdagent` is running, can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the same privileges as the user running the agent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be local to the virtual machine or user session where `spice-vdagent` is running.
- The attacker must be able to influence or control the `save_dir` variable which is passed to the `vdagent_file_xfers_data` function, typically through a file transfer operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the virtual machine or user session.
- Ability to influence file transfer operations and thereby control the save directory used by `spice-vdagent`.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix was to replace the use of `system()` with `g_spawn_async()`. This function avoids the need to quote the filename.
- The code also includes a check for `g_spawn_async` failure and logs a warning to syslog in case of failure.
- The vulnerability was reported by Seth Arnold <seth.arnold@canonical.com>.
