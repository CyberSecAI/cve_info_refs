## Description

[![@michaelnoonan](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1627582?v=4&size=48)](/michaelnoonan)[michaelnoonan](https://github.com/michaelnoonan)opened [on Oct 18, 2017](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/3869#issue-266350961)
# Issue

See private issue: <https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/issues/1282>

[CVE-2017-15610](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xhvr-qq82-mmqx "CVE-2017-15610")

When the special `Guest` user account is granted the `CertificateExportPrivateKey` permission, and Guest Access is enabled for the Octopus Server, an attacker can sign in as the `Guest` account and export Certificates managed by Octopus, including the private key.

We generally recommend the `Guest` account is not granted these high-level permissions, but want to take the extra step to ensure private keys are never leaked to the `Guest` user account.

# Affected Versions

Octopus `3.11.0` to `3.17.6`. Fixed in Octopus `3.17.7`.

# Implemented Solution

The special `Guest` account is specifically denied access to export certificates including the private key, even if the `Guest` account has been granted the `CertificateExportPrivateKey` permission.

Fixed in <https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/pull/1384>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
