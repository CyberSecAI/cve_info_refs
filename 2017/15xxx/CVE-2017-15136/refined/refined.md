  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When registering a system with Satellite 6, a hostname must be specified. If an additional system is registered with the same hostname, the original system will stop receiving updates from Satellite 6.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "System registration process in Satellite 6 does not prevent duplicate hostnames",
      "Lack of validation or uniqueness check on hostnames during registration"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with administrative privileges to add systems to a Satellite 6 server could exploit this to prevent other hosts from getting security updates. The original system loses access to updates, including security updates.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Attacker registers a new system with the same hostname as an existing registered system on a Satellite 6 server"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Administrative privileges to add systems to a Satellite 6 server"
