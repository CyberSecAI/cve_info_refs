- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Huawei FusionSphere OpenStack uses a low version transmission protocol by default, which is vulnerable to interception.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak due to weak transmission protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could intercept network packets, potentially leading to an information leak.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, requiring the attacker to gain access to the target device's network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs network access to the target device's network.
