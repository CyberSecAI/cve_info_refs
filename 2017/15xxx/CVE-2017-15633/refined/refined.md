{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the Lua files of the TP-Link router firmware. Specifically, the `new-ipgroup` variable in the `session_limits.lua` file is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command, allowing for command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the web management interface of the TP-Link router. A remote attacker, after obtaining valid administrator credentials, can inject malicious commands via the `new-ipgroup` parameter during a POST request to the relevant Lua script.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials to access the web management panel of the TP-Link router. They also need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker can be on the LAN or WAN side if remote management is enabled."

  "additional_details": {
    "affected_products": "Multiple TP-Link router models (WVR-, WAR-, and ER- series). Specific models listed in the document include TL-WVR450L, TL-WVR900G, ER5110G, ER5120G, ER5510G, ER5520G, R4149G, R4239G, R4299G, R473GP-AC, R473G, R473P-AC, R473, R478G+, R478, R478+, R483G, R483, R488, WAR1300L, WAR1750L, WAR2600L, WAR302, WAR450L, WAR450, WAR458L, WAR458, WAR900L, WVR1300G, WVR1300L, WVR1750L, WVR2600L, WVR300, WVR302, WVR4300L, WVR450L, WVR450, WVR458L, WVR900G, WVR900L.",
    "poc": "The provided proof of concept code demonstrates how to exploit a similar vulnerability (CVE-2017-15616) in `phddns.lua` by injecting a command into the 'interface' parameter. This PoC includes authentication, deletion of existing rule, and sending the malicious payload which will open the telnetd service on the router. Similar logic can be used to exploit CVE-2017-15633.",
    "timeline": "Issues found between 2017.08 and 2017.09; Vendor contacted on 2017.09.26; Vendor confirmation on 2017.10.13; CVE requested on 2017.10.14; CVE assigned on 2017.10.19; Vendor confirmed fix for all products by 2018.1."
