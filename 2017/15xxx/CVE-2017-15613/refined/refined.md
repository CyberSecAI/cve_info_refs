Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in various Lua files of TP-Link router firmware. Specifically, the `new-interface` variable within the `cmxddns.lua` file (as indicated by CVE-2017-15613) and similar variables in other Lua files are vulnerable to command injection. When these variables are passed to the system's `fork_exec` function, they allow attackers to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into system commands without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to execute malicious code.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Lua scripts do not adequately validate or sanitize the input received via HTTP POST requests before using it in shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with the privileges of the web server process.
- **Complete Router Compromise:** An attacker can fully compromise the router and potentially perform malicious activities such as:
    -   Modifying router configurations
    -   Monitoring network traffic
    -   Creating backdoors for persistent access
    -   Launching attacks on other devices on the network
    -   Opening the telnet daemon as shown in the PoC

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via specially crafted HTTP POST requests to specific URLs associated with the vulnerable Lua scripts.
- **Web Management Interface:** Attackers exploit the web management interface of the TP-Link routers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers must have valid administrator credentials for the router's web management panel to exploit these vulnerabilities.
- **Network Access:** Attackers can trigger these vulnerabilities from the local network (LAN) or remotely (WAN) if remote management is enabled on the router.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable URLs and parameters:** Attackers need to know the specific URLs and parameter names to send the crafted HTTP POST requests

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects a wide range of TP-Link SOHO/Wi-Fi routers, including models from the WVR, WAR, and ER series. A list of specific affected models is provided in the text.
- **Patch Availability:** TP-Link has confirmed that all affected products have been fixed.
- **Proof-of-Concept (PoC):**  A Python PoC script is provided, which shows how to log in and then exploit the vulnerability by injecting a command into the "interface" parameter within a crafted HTTP POST request, and the telnet daemon is opened.
- **CVE-2017-15616 is explained in detail,** which is similar to CVE-2017-15613, with other CVEs listed with their corresponding vulnerable parameters and files
