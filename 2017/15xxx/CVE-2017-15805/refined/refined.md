Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. The `thispage` parameter in `scgi-bin/platform.cgi` is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input used to construct file paths, allowing attackers to use `../` sequences to navigate outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`, potentially leading to further compromise such as gaining access to user credentials and gaining access to system configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is accessed over the network via HTTP requests to the affected resource.
*   **Specifically, by manipulating the `thispage` parameter** within a request to `/scgi-bin/platform.cgi` using directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is needed.
*   **No special privileges:** No prior privileges are required for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business SA520 and SA540 series security appliances with firmware versions 2.1.71 and 2.2.0.7.
*   The proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to read the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files by injecting the payload `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00index.htm` into the vulnerable parameter.
*   The vulnerability is likely to affect other devices within the SA500 series, although only specific models and firmware were tested.
