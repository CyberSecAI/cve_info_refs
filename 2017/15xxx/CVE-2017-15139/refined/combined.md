## Data retained after deletion of a ScaleIO volume

### Summary

Certain storage volume configurations allow newly created volumes to
contain previous data. This could lead to leakage of sensitive
information between tenants.

### Affected Services / Software

Cinder releases up to and including Queens with ScaleIO volumes
using thin volumes and zero padding.

### Discussion

Using both thin volumes and zero padding does not ensure data contained
in a volume is actually deleted. The default volume provisioning rule is
set to thick so most installations are likely not affected. Operators
can check their configuration in `cinder.conf` or check for zero padding
with this command `scli --query\_all`.

### Recommended Actions

Operators can use the following two workarounds, until the release of
Rocky (planned 30th August 2018) which resolves the issue.

1. Swap to thin volumes

2. Ensure ScaleIO storage pools use zero-padding with:

```
   scli --modify_zero_padding_policy
   (((--protection_domain_id <ID> |
   --protection_domain_name <NAME>)
   --storage_pool_name <NAME>) | --storage_pool_id <ID>)
   (--enable_zero_padding | --disable_zero_padding)`

```

I have updated the package and still not in this version you mentioned:   [root@overcloud-cinder-controller-0 heat-admin]# yum install python-cinder Loaded plugins: product-id, search-disabled-repos, subscription-manager Package 1:python-cinder-12.0.3-2.el7ost.noarch already installed and latest version Nothing to do   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1622535#c2)  Elise Gafford    2018-09-10 16:07:57 UTC  ``` Hi Erlon,  For the sake of completeness: as Alan noted in the 12.0 clone of this bug, this fix will be available after QA, in version openstack-cinder-12.0.3-3.el7ost or above. The bug state is the best indicator of progress; at present it is MODIFIED, meaning that the fix has been backported, committed, reviewed, passed dev CI, and pushed into a testable build. From here it will flow into ON_QA, VERIFIED, and RELEASE_PENDING (which are all pretty self-explanatory) on its way to CLOSED, at which point the fix will be generally available.  Thanks, Elise   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1622535#c3)  Erlon    2018-09-11 15:46:28 UTC  ``` Hi Elise,  Thanks for the detailed description, it was very helpful. Erlon   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1622535#c4)  Alan Bishop    2018-10-10 23:16:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1638127](show_bug.cgi?id=1638127 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - [OSP-13] NetApp: Ontap FC/iSCSI drivers does not support force_detach") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1622535#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-13 22:13:36 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-07-10 21:27:57 UTC  ``` Summary Certain storage volume configurations allow newly created volumes to contain previous data. This could lead to leakage of sensitive information between tenants.  Affected Services / Software Cinder releases up to and including Queens with ScaleIO volumes using thin volumes and zero padding.  External references:  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0084>  Upstream bug:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1699573](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/%2Bbug/1699573)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c2)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-07-20 13:55:10 UTC  ``` upstream fix:  <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/cinder/commit/?id=5492e2206a7736079279f45e9c8b931ca19fb322>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c3)  Summer Long    2018-07-31 00:20:49 UTC  ``` The 2018 upstream fix prevents the creation of thick volumes with disabled zero padding by default (although can be overridden with config option, sio_allow_non_padded_thick_volumes).   <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/cinder/commit/?id=7feb62197d371ab7253dc86a34af6ff8b484b4df>  Note: fix is in 13 dev milestone, to be released with Rocky.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c6)  Summer Long    2018-07-31 04:14:17 UTC  ``` Created openstack-cinder tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1610143](show_bug.cgi?id=1610143 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2017-15139 openstack-cinder: Data retained after deletion of a ScaleIO volume [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c18)  Summer Long    2018-08-20 00:22:20 UTC  ``` Upstream bug for thin volumes: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1784871](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/%2Bbug/1784871) Upstream patch (scaleIO):<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/592001/>  Upstream rocky (not merged yet): <https://review.openstack.org/593188>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c22)  Summer Long    2018-08-21 23:35:15 UTC  ``` Next patch: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/593694/>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c23)  Summer Long    2018-08-28 00:33:07 UTC  ``` Upstream queens: <https://review.openstack.org/596879>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c24)  Summer Long    2018-09-11 23:04:24 UTC  ``` Upstream pike: <https://review.openstack.org/601681>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c25)  Summer Long    2018-09-21 00:35:49 UTC  ``` Upstream ocata: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/604105/>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c26)  Summer Long    2018-10-02 01:30:07 UTC  ``` Upstream newton: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/606130/>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c28)  Summer Long    2018-10-10 02:18:15 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This flaw only affects Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployments which use the third-party EMC ScaleIO driver plugin. To mitigate this flaw, ensure all volumes use zero-padding by updating the ScaleIO storage-pool policy.  Note: Only an empty pool's policy can be changed.  ~~~ scli --modify_zero_padding_policy    (((--protection_domain_id <ID> |    --protection_domain_name <NAME>)    --storage_pool_name <NAME>) | --storage_pool_id <ID>)    (--enable_zero_padding | --disable_zero_padding)  Example: scli --modify_zero_padding_policy --protection_domain_name pd10 --storage_pool_name scale1 --enable_zero_padding ~~~   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c30)  Summer Long    2018-10-16 01:52:08 UTC  ``` Statement:  With this update, disabled zero-padding is no longer the default for new volumes. Users can override this behavior by setting the new configuration item, "sio_allow_non_padded_volumes=True". However, the default should not be overridden if multiple tenants will be using volumes from a shared Storage Pool.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-13 22:13:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)  Via RHSA-2018:3601 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3601](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3601)   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c33)  Sofia Enriquez    2019-01-25 22:46:52 UTC  ``` Tomas, sorry for the wrong update.

What specific Red Hat OpenStack Platform version to validate? From the bug, <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-15139> , the fix is in ‘cinder 10.0.8,  cinder 13.0.0.0rc2, cinder 12.04’, but I’m not sure what version we’re talking about. 2.	What specific ScaleIO/VxFlexOS array version to validate? 3.	What specific ScaleIO/VxFlexOS deployment option to validate, although I think 2-layer should be good for validate the fix. •	2-layer storage? This is when the ScaleIO/VxFlexOS Storage is installed in separate servers outside of Openstack nodes. •	Or Hyperconverged? This is when the Openstack and storage is installed in the same servers.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c0)  Alan Bishop    2018-10-19 16:29:41 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1622453](show_bug.cgi?id=1622453 "CLOSED ERRATA - cinder always check image_volume_cache_max_size_gb and image_volume_cache_max_count when either of them is specified.") +++  Description of problem: cinder always check image_volume_cache_max_size_gb and image_volume_cache_max_count when either of them is specified.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add  image_volume_cache_max_count parameter and set a value greater than 0 2. Try to create a volume and it can't create more than 1. 3.  Actual results: Only 1 image cache is available. And cinder shows following message. ~~~ Reclaiming image-volume cache space; removing cache entry  ~~~  Expected results: Image cache should be created as the number of image_volume_cache_max_count   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c6)  Tzach Shefi    2018-11-04 06:18:44 UTC  ``` Alan,  A bit confused with my results, what am I missing here?   Configured image cache image_volume_cache_max_count = 2  restarted docker  Uploaded 3 different glance images. Created three volumes one from each image, volumes were created fine.   Despite setting max cache count to 2, after creating three volumes from three separate images, shouldn't I only see\have 2 cached images available?  As I noticed three of them:  cinder list --all-tenants | grep image- | 28b45bc5-48ed-40f0-8bf7-e9ce39e35dd0 | a426863856c54f79befc54a7f1bd1f16 | available | image-3d2baba5-977a-4683-898f-4e13c5070fe0 | 1    | -           | false    |                                      | | 594ac77a-4443-4967-8abe-d48b22d750de | a426863856c54f79befc54a7f1bd1f16 | available | image-1c73e4d0-48a0-46de-a3bb-c89af4435bde | 1    | -           | false    |                                      | | 7b0dba2a-acfd-4de6-9b28-266d2829bddd | a426863856c54f79befc54a7f1bd1f16 | available | image-d7e24948-6ec2-4154-9241-b75ea87146d6 | 1    | -           | false    |                                      |  Deleted all volumes and purged the cache, only to reproduce with same results. Again three volumes created plus three cached images.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c8)  Alan Bishop    2018-11-05 16:39:57 UTC  ``` Tzach,  It was good for me to have access to the deployment because the problem is subtle. Basically, you need to enable the image volume cache in the correct location in cinder.conf, and it seems like you are trying to do it in the iscsi backend. That won't work, and you can see there's a cinder-volume.log message that states the image volume cache is disabled.  When the cache is enabled, you can monitor its behavior by looking for additional DEBUG log messages. There's a message that tells you the cache's current size and count, and the configured max size and max count.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c9)  Alan Bishop    2018-11-05 17:00:00 UTC  ``` Sorry, ignore my previous comment. I was looking at an older log file when the cache had not been enabled. I'll post another update once I finish analyzing the latest logs.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c10)  Alan Bishop    2018-11-05 19:28:46 UTC  ``` Tzach,  The issue you describe arose due to confusion about the image volume cache options appearing twice in the cinder.conf. Cinder added support for a separate [backend_defaults] section which is where default values for settings appear when those settings can be overridden by a specific backend. Unfortunately, you modified the image_volume_cache_max_count in the original [DEFAULT] section, which is no longer relevant.  So, what you want to do is set the image_volume_cache_max_count value on L1627 in cinder.conf. That's the one in the [backend_defaults] section (which starts on L1409).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c11)  Tzach Shefi    2018-11-06 01:52:27 UTC  ``` Thanks, learned something new about cinder.conf.   So now I've set cache max count on line L1627, restarted docker Still got 3 cached image volumes.  Scratch that I've even tried setting it directly on lVM backend section,the last two lines on cinder.conf, restarted docker, again three cached images.   Now here is the fun part I just realized, which might explain things or be a bug, I'm not sure.    This command: #cinder create 1 --image cirros & cinder create 1 --image cirros.raw & cinder create 1 --image dsl  Produces 3 volumes + 3 cached images - not good.  Then again maybe it's my use of "&" which complicates things. Well it simplifies testing with a 1 liner but parallel.  Still I mean a user could issue this command, no reason it shouldn't work right?  However these three when serialized: #cinder create 1 --image cirros #cinder create 1 --image cirros.raw #cinder create 1 --image dsl  Produce 3 volumes + 1 cached image, which is better, great. But shouldn't I still see the 2 last cached images, why does only 1 remain? Maybe cause it's cirros qcow2 and raw ?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c12)  Alan Bishop    2018-11-06 02:51:40 UTC  ``` Just lowering a limit does not trigger removing anything in order to be under the new limit. The cache limits are enforced only when a new entry is added to the cache.  The best way to answer your questions about the behavior you saw is to examine the c-vol log. Each time a new entry is added to the cache, there's a DEBUG message that reports on the current cache size and count, plus the cache limits. Then, if the cache is over the limits, you'll see more messages about entries being deleted, and cache size and count after deleting that entry.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1641111#c13)  Tzach Shefi    2018-11-13 18:43:11 UTC  ``` Verified on: openstack-cinder-12.0.4-2.el7ost.noarch  Set max cache count = 2  Created three volumes each from a different image, as expected only two images-xx remain under cinder list, meaning only two cached images.   I noticed one of them being deleted and replaced with "third" cached image.   Looks good to verify.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-07-10 21:27:57 UTC  ``` Summary Certain storage volume configurations allow newly created volumes to contain previous data. This could lead to leakage of sensitive information between tenants.  Affected Services / Software Cinder releases up to and including Queens with ScaleIO volumes using thin volumes and zero padding.

Users can override this behavior by setting the new configuration item, "sio_allow_non_padded_volumes=True". However, the default should not be overridden if multiple tenants will be using volumes from a shared Storage Pool.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-13 22:13:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)  Via RHSA-2018:3601 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3601](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3601)   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1599899#c33)  Sofia Enriquez    2019-01-25 22:46:52 UTC  ``` Tomas, sorry for the wrong update.

What specific Red Hat OpenStack Platform version to validate? From the bug, <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-15139> , the fix is in ‘cinder 10.0.8,  cinder 13.0.0.0rc2, cinder 12.04’, but I’m not sure what version we’re talking about. 2.	What specific ScaleIO/VxFlexOS array version to validate? 3.	What specific ScaleIO/VxFlexOS deployment option to validate, although I think 2-layer should be good for validate the fix. •	2-layer storage? This is when the ScaleIO/VxFlexOS Storage is installed in separate servers outside of Openstack nodes. •	Or Hyperconverged? This is when the Openstack and storage is installed in the same servers.   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2019:0917 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-cinder security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A0917)

## Topic

An update for openstack-cinder is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programmatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-cinder: Data retained after deletion of a ScaleIO volume (CVE-2017-15139)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, image operations in cinder failed due to file I/O issues.

With this update, you can create volumes from an image in cinder without file I/O issues. (BZ#1476213)

* Previously, the cinder logs contained fixed\_key value.

With this update, the fixed\_key value is not logged. (BZ#1655742)

* Previously, it was not possible to attach a volume on the host due to an issue with 3PAR driver and Fibre Channel World Wide Name.

With this update, you can attach Fibre Channel volumes even with a wrong host configuration at the backend. (BZ#1667997)

* Previously, only admin users could set the Volume Type in the glance image using cinder\_img\_vol\_type custom property.

With this update, non-admin users can also set the Volume Type in a glance image. (BZ#1671260)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3601)

## Topic

An update for openstack-cinder is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programmatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-cinder: Data retained after deletion of a ScaleIO volume (CVE-2017-15139)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* This fix enables the NetApp ONTAP FC/iSCSI drivers to succeed in the force\_detach action, which terminates every connection between the specified volume and any host it is mapped to. (BZ#1622535)
* The driver for the Block Storage service's SolidFire backend would crash when attempting to delete a consistency group snapshot. This issue has been fixed so the driver no longer crashes attempting to delete a consistency group snapshot. (BZ#1629049)
* This backport adds the configuration option rbd\_exclusive\_cinder\_pool, which defaults to True. This option improves statistics collection for large numbers of RBD volumes. This option should be set to False if your pool is not used exclusively by Cinder. (BZ#1624482)
* The Block Storage service's NetApp ONTAP driver could not format URLs properly when they contained IPv6 addresses resulting in malformed URLs in the management path and driver malfunction. The driver now properly handles IPv6 addresses so the properly formatted URLs facilitate correct functioning. (BZ#1635620)
* The driver for the Block Storage service's SolidFire backend contained a bug related to the force-detach operation. The driver would crash when attempting to force-detach a volume. This issue has been fixed so attempts to force-detach a volume no longer crash the driver. (BZ#1638406)
* Support was added for volume retype and migration operations to the Block Storage service's HPE Nimble Storage driver. (BZ#1640833)
* The Block Storage service's Nimble backend driver did not support the forced detach functionality using empty connector information. The Nimble driver would fail when a forced detach was issued. The Nimble driver has been updated to support a forced detach with empty connector information. The driver properly supports the Block Storage service's forced detach API. (BZ#1640834)
* The Block Storage service (cinder) uses two volume cache limit settings. When only one cache limit was configured, adding a new entry to the cache would always cause an existing entry to be ejected from the cache. Only a single entry would be cached, regardless of the configured cache limit. The Block Storage service now correctly handles volume cache limits. (BZ#1641111)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c0)  ojanas    2019-01-31 09:17:05 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  We added a custom property to an image: "cinder_img_vol_type". Thus, the block devices sourced from the image are created on the specific cinder backend defined by the property.  But we are hitting a problem that the property works only if one creates a volume in the "admin" project logged in via admin user.  The admin project is the owner of the image. Its a public image and the properties are visible to other projects/users also.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c2)  Abhishek Kekane    2019-02-04 11:15:56 UTC  ``` IMO problem is in glance-protection.conf file, here you need to allow access to read properties to all the users. As of now it has access to admin user only which needs to be changed to all intended users.  As of now <http://collab-shell.usersys.redhat.com/02305543/sosreport-20190130-184654/stagin-controller-01.testdev.env/etc/glance/glance-protection.conf> has below property protection is defined.  [cinder_img_volume_type] create = admin read = admin update = admin delete = admin   Which needs to be changed to,  [cinder_img_volume_type] create = admin read = @ update = admin delete = admin  '@' means all users will able to read this property, if you want to restrict it to specific users then you can specify comma separated list as "read=admin,user1,user2,..."  Also need to enable this option in glance-api.conf file, as of now it is commented. #property_protection_file = /etc/glance/glance-protection.conf  After changing this file, restart the glance api service and check again.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c3)  Cyril Roelandt    2019-02-06 12:55:44 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1671258](show_bug.cgi?id=1671258 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Glance image custom property is not implemented outside the Image's Project (owner)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c4)  Gorka Eguileor    2019-02-07 13:10:35 UTC  ``` This is a context elevation problem.  During the creation process we get the volume type declared in the cinder_img_volume_type on the volume.flows.api.create_volume, and we use the context of the user that made the call.  If this user is not admin, then it is not allowed to see the extra specs, so the DB layer removes the extra specs from the data returned.  Since there are not extra specs in the loaded volume type, when we make the call to the scheduler it doesn't have the backend name to select the right backend.  This doesn't happen with the admin user because the DB will return the extra specs.  Also, this doesn't happen when you create a volume directly with the volume type because in that case we are forcefully loading the specs at cinder.volume.api.  We'll need a custom patch on OSP12, OSP11, and OSP10, as this was inadvertently fixed in OSP13 when fixing a different bug: <https://review.openstack.org/579049>, and we can't backport directly because it's based on a features added in OSP13: <https://review.openstack.org/552243>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c5)  Alan Bishop    2019-02-07 13:21:08 UTC  ``` OSP11 and OSP12 are EOL, so a patch for just OSP10 should be sufficient.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c6)  Gorka Eguileor    2019-02-07 13:53:27 UTC  ``` Turns out this issue is not present in OSP11, and closer inspection showed that it was fixed on <https://review.openstack.org/409030> to resolve a completely different issue ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1648717](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/%2Bbug/1648717)), though they are both caused by the same context check. So we just need to backport that patch.  ps: @abishop: if I had needed a custom patch, which I just realized I don't, I would still have had to fix it in upstream OSP12's counterpart first  ;-)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c16)  Tzach Shefi    2019-04-02 08:11:06 UTC  ``` Gorka,  Think missing some step or did something wrong.

that it's not "cinder_img_vol_type" but "cinder_img_volume_type" like mentioned in Abhishek's [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c2) and my [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1671260#c4). You should first confirm that you can do it with the admin, since the description of the problem says they can do that, and then confirm you can also do it with a non admin user.   ```  [Comment
