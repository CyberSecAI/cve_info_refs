{
  "CVE-2017-15139": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that thin volumes with zero padding disabled in certain configurations of the ScaleIO storage backend within OpenStack Cinder can retain data after deletion. When a new volume is created, it might contain data from previously deleted volumes if zero-padding is not enforced during volume creation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Data leakage due to the lack of zero padding on thin volumes in ScaleIO storage backend.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Sensitive information leakage between tenants. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to data previously stored on a deleted volume when a new volume is allocated in the same storage space.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need the ability to create volumes within the OpenStack environment using a ScaleIO backend with the described misconfiguration.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a tenant within the OpenStack environment and have the ability to create volumes using a misconfigured ScaleIO backend storage pool. No further system privileges or capabilities seem to be required."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is that when using thin volumes with zero-padding disabled in ScaleIO, newly created volumes might contain data from previously deleted volumes.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The weakness lies in the configuration that allows the creation of thin volumes without zero-padding, leading to data remnants.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially access sensitive data from a previous user's volume.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a new volume in a storage pool that had zero-padding disabled, where previous volumes existed.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would require the ability to create volumes within the OpenStack environment and target a ScaleIO storage pool with zero-padding disabled."
