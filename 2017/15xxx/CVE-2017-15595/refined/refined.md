Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by a missing restriction in Xen's handling of linear page tables. x86 PV guests are allowed to set up linear page tables where page tables can reference other page tables at the same or higher level. When these page tables are de-typed, Xen recursively drops typed refcounts. However, there was no limit on the recursion depth for page tables of the same level mapping each other, which can lead to stack overflow and a crash.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unlimited recursion in linear pagetable de-typing
- Missing restriction on recursion depth during page table cleanup.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS) of the hypervisor and entire host due to a crash.
- Potential privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded.

Attack vectors:
- A malicious or buggy PV (Paravirtualized) guest can exploit this vulnerability.
- The guest sets up a chain of page tables that map to each other, causing recursion during cleanup, resulting in a crash.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must have control over a PV guest.
- The ability to manipulate page table structures from within the guest is necessary.
