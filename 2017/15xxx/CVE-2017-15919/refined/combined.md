Found a few features missing:
Deleting Steps – As far as I can see, you can only delete the last step, which isn’t very useful when you have completed the form then want to remove the first step.
Conditional Logic (Pages) – It is not possible to move to a specific step if a condition is met.
I haven’t tried the single step forms, but I am assuming they are working. I wish I had known about these issues before buying as I would have researched more to find something more suitable.

Worth the upgrade to the paid plugin.
I use it on loads of sites, it replaces contact form 7 as my go to & can be used for surveys.
The support is second to none.

This form is very easy to use, and I am so impressed at the quick and helpful responses I have received every time I contact support with questions or issues that arise. It’s great to use a plugin that is actively being developed and improved!
