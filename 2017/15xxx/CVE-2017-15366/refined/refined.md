```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Default database (Cache) users are set up with a single, hardcoded password on both the server and laptop clients. This password is then stored in cleartext within a log file during client installation on laptops.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use of hardcoded default credentials",
    "Storage of credentials in cleartext",
    "Insecure permissions"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full administrative/system access to client devices (if no firewall is present) or the Ndoc server. This allows for full control over the compromised system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. Once the password is known, an attacker does not need local access to the affected system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to obtain the cleartext password found in the log file. This could potentially be obtained through social engineering or if the logs are exposed to unauthorized individuals. Once the password is acquired, they can remotely access vulnerable devices or the server."
