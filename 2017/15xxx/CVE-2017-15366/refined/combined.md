|  | [Description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | Before Thornberry Ndoc version 8.0, laptop clients and the server have default |
|  | database (Cache) users set up with a single password. This password is |
|  | left behind in a cleartext log file during client installation on |
|  | laptops. This password can be used to gain full admin/system access to |
|  | client devices (if no firewall is present) or the Ndoc server itself. |
|  | Once the password is known to an attacker, local access is not |
|  | required. |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Additional Information] |
|  | Version 8.0 of Ndoc has been released to correct this vulnerability. |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |

|  |  |
|  | [Impact Information Disclosure] |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Vectors] |
|  | A local password stored in plaintext can be used to remotely attack |
|  | other devices or the Ndoc server. Once the password is known to an |
|  | attacker, local access is not required. |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
