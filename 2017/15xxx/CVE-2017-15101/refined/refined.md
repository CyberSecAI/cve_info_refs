Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8184 in liblouis. A stack-based buffer overflow was missed in the `findTable()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The core weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `findTable()` function, which could be triggered during the processing of braille translation tables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability has the potential to allow arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is in liblouis, a braille translator library. Therefore, the attack vector would involve supplying crafted input (likely related to braille translation tables) that triggers the buffer overflow when processed by liblouis.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to provide input to an application or service that uses the vulnerable version of liblouis.
*   Specific skills might be needed to craft malicious input that triggers the overflow in the `findTable()` function.

**Additional details:**
*   The bug report indicates that Samuel Thibault proposed a patch for this vulnerability.
*   The issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 via RHSA-2017:3384.
*   The fix was included in liblouis version 2.5.4.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "moderate" severity by Red Hat.
