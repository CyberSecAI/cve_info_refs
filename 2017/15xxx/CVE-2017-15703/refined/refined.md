Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the unsafe deserialization of Java objects within the template upload functionality of Apache NiFi. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the use of `JAXBContext` for processing XML templates without proper measures to prevent the deserialization of malicious code embedded within the XML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The system deserializes Java objects from XML templates without proper validation or sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized Java objects.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any authenticated user, including those who do not have specific administrative privileges (i.e., those without ACL permissions), highlighting a flaw in access control during template uploads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting malicious code through a specially crafted template, an attacker can cause a denial of service. This likely involves exploiting the deserialization process to consume system resources or trigger an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Template Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious XML template containing embedded serialized Java objects.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the NiFi system to upload a template, but does not need to have any special authorization like ACL permissions.
*   **XML Payload:** The crafted XML template is designed to trigger the vulnerable deserialization process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user to access the template upload feature within the NiFi application.
*  **No special authorization:** The attacker does not need specific authorization (e.g., ACL permissions).
*   **Crafted Payload:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a malicious XML payload containing serialized Java objects that will trigger the vulnerability upon deserialization.

**Additional Details:**

*   This CVE is directly linked to the JIRA issue [NIFI-4357](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4357) and the corresponding GitHub pull request [#2134](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2134).
*   The fix involves proper handling of Java deserialization, likely by sanitizing the input or preventing direct deserialization of untrusted objects using JAXBContext in the template loading process.
* The vulnerability was fixed in NiFi version 1.4.0.

This analysis goes into more detail than the basic CVE description, clarifying the attack vector, the vulnerability's impact, and the required attacker capabilities.
