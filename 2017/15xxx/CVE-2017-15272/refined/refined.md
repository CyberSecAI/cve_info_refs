Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15272:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The PSFTPd server stores user passwords in cleartext within its configuration file (PSFTPd.dat), which is a Microsoft Access Database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Password Storage (CWE-312):**  Passwords are not hashed or encrypted, making them easily readable if the configuration file is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who gains access to the PSFTPd.dat file can extract the cleartext passwords of all users. This compromises the confidentiality of user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the server's filesystem where the PSFTPd.dat file is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Privileges:** The attacker needs to have some level of local access (e.g., local user account) to access and read the PSFTPd.dat file. This is described as "Local/Low privileges" in the description.

**Additional Information:**

*   The server uses a hardcoded password "ITsILLEGAL" for the Microsoft Access Database encryption flag. However, this is not effective in securing the database, as the database can be easily accessed without this password using tools such as `mdb-export`.
*   The provided text refers to CVE-2017-15272 specifically, and thus the provided information is relevant.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "Low" severity issue with a CVSS score of 3.3.
* The advisory suggests using Active Directory connector for user management as a workaround.

**Summary of Findings:**

The vulnerability exists due to the storage of user passwords in clear text in a local database file. This allows an attacker with local access to obtain the passwords of all users, leading to a potential compromise of user credentials.
