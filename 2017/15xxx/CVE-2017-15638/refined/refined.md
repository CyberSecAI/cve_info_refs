Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-15638

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing source network restriction for RPC services within the SuSEfirewall2 package. Specifically, the firewall was adding implicit rules for port 111 (used by the portmap service) without considering source network restrictions defined for `_rpc_` services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly restrict access to the portmap service (port 111). The firewall rules implicitly added for port 111 lacked source network restrictions, making the portmap service accessible from any network, even when the administrator intended to restrict it to certain network segments.
- **Implicit Rule Handling Error:** The software failed to handle implicit firewall rules for RPC services correctly and did not take source network restrictions into account when creating implicit firewall rules for port 111.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Intended Access Restrictions:** An attacker could bypass intended access restrictions on the portmap service.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** With access to portmap, an attacker could potentially exploit other RPC services running on the system, leading to further compromise. The vulnerability itself does not describe any direct privilege escalation. However, access to portmap is a crucial stepping stone for other attacks.
- **Confidentiality and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability is rated as having a moderate impact with a potential for partial loss of confidentiality and availability (CVSS v2: C:P/I:N/A:P, CVSS v3: C:L/I:N/A:L)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability does not require authentication to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

- openSUSE Leap 42.2
- openSUSE Leap 42.3
