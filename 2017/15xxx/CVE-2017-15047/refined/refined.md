Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `clusterLoadConfig` function within `cluster.c`. The function uses an integer value parsed from user-controlled input as an array index, specifically the `slot` variable. The `slot` value is derived from user-provided input via `atoi(argv[j]+1)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unvalidated Array Index:** The `slot` variable, which is obtained from user input via `atoi`, is used directly as an index into the arrays `server.cluster->migrating_slots_to` and `server.cluster->importing_slots_from` without any bounds checking or validation.
- **Buffer Overflow:** If the attacker provides an input that results in a `slot` value greater than or equal to the allocated size of these arrays, an out-of-bounds write occurs, potentially leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** An attacker can cause memory corruption by writing to memory outside the bounds of the `migrating_slots_to` and `importing_slots_from` arrays.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** The memory corruption may potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly stated but is suggested in the github issue as a possibility.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Cluster Configuration File:** The attacker can control the input by crafting malicious entries in the cluster configuration file. The `slot` variable is derived from arguments contained within the configuration file, which are parsed by `sdssplitargs`.
- **Limited access to machine**: The github issue states that an attacker with limited access to the machine would be able to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify or provide the cluster configuration file that is loaded by the Redis server.
- The attacker would need to have limited access to the machine to manipulate the cluster configuration.
