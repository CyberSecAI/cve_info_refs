# Potential Buffer Overflow from user-controllable Array Index value¬†#4278

## Description

[![@kirit1193](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624097?v=4&size=48)](/kirit1193)[kirit1193](https://github.com/kirit1193)opened [on Aug 31, 2017](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/4278#issue-254437107)

The *clusterLoadConfig* function within */redis/src/cluster.c* seems to allow for a Buffer Overflow vulnerability leading from an array index being set from user-controllable input. The vulnerable code is:

```
direction = p[1]; /* Either '>' or '<' */
slot = atoi(argv[j]+1);
p += 3;
cn = clusterLookupNode(p);
if (!cn) {
   cn = createClusterNode(p,0);
   clusterAddNode(cn);
   }
if (direction == '>') {
   server.cluster->migrating_slots_to[slot] = cn;
} else {
   server.cluster->importing_slots_from[slot] = cn;
}

```

As we can see, the *slot* variable is receiving the output of atoi being run here: `slot = atoi(argv[j]+1);`

Now, *argv[j]* is basically the arguments of each line (stored in *line[]*) being put into the array using *sdssplitargs* for further processing.

The slot value, after being extracted is then used in the *if-else* block which controls the slot migration, i.e. `server.cluster->migrating_slots_to[slot] = cn;` and `server.cluster->importing_slots_from[slot] = cn;`.

It is safe to assume that a user won't try to put in invalid slot numbers in the cluster configuration file. However, an attacker with limited access to the machine would be able to trigger memory corruption issues or even potentially execute code by forcing an Array Index out of Bounds exception from happening due to invalid values of *slot*. There should be some validation on the value of *slot* and the maximum length of the *migrating\_slots\_to* and *migrating\_slots\_from* arrays.
