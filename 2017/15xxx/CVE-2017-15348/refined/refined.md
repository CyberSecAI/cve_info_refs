- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of parameters within MPLS Echo Request messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of input data, specifically within MPLS Echo Request messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a device reset/reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker sends specially crafted MPLS Echo Request messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected devices and target devices must have MPLS enabled.
