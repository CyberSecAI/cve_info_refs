{
  "CVE-2017-15127": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where an additional implicit page unlock for VM_SHARED hugetlbfs mapping could trigger local denial of service by crashing the kernel.",
    "root_cause": "The `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte` function, used in hugetlbfs mappings with `VM_SHARED` flag set, contained a superfluous page unlock when an error occurred. The error would cause the function to return without removing the page from the page cache which causes a kernel panic when the page is unlocked a second time via `unlock_page(page)` function call. This second unlock was present in the code block before the `put_page(page)` function call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double page unlock"
    ],
    "impact": "Local denial of service by crashing the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Userland process triggers `UFFDIO_COPY` ioctl call on non-hole offset of a `VM_SHARED` hugetlbfs mapping which leads to the improper unlock."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to create hugetlbfs mappings with `VM_SHARED` flags set and call `UFFDIO_COPY` ioctl."
