OpenSSL Security Advisory [07 Dec 2017]
========================================
Read/write after SSL object in error state (CVE-2017-3737)
==========================================================
Severity: Moderate
OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state"
mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then
OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you
attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit
handshake functions (SSL\_do\_handshake(), SSL\_accept() and SSL\_connect()),
however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL\_read() or SSL\_write() is
called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error
will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() is
subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will
succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from
the SSL/TLS record layer.
In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that
resulted in a call to SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() being issued after having already
received a fatal error.
This issue does not affect OpenSSL 1.1.0.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2n
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 10th November 2017 by David Benjamin
(Google). The fix was proposed by David Benjamin and implemented by Matt Caswell
of the OpenSSL development team.
rsaz\_1024\_mul\_avx2 overflow bug on x86\_64 (CVE-2017-3738)
=========================================================
Severity: Low
There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure
used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.
Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect
would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks
against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work
necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline.
The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share
the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option
since CVE-2016-0701.
This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions
like Intel Haswell (4th generation).
Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732
and CVE-2015-3193.
Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of
OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it
becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL
git repository.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2n
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd November 2017 by David Benjamin
(Google). The issue was originally found via the OSS-Fuzz project. The fix was
developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL development team.
Note
====
Support for version 1.0.1 ended on 31st December 2016. Support for versions
0.9.8 and 1.0.0 ended on 31st December 2015. Those versions are no longer
receiving security updates.

Data Confidentiality/Integrity Vulnerability, December 2017
# [*(Update 7-December-2017)* Security releases available](#update-7-december-2017-security-releases-available)

## [Summary](#summary)

Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. These include the fix for the vulnerability identified in the initial announcement.

In addition the updates for 8.X and 9.X include a fix for a low severity buffer vulnerability as describe below.

We recommend that all users upgrade as soon as possible.

## [Downloads](#downloads)

* [Node.js 9 (Current)](/en/blog/release/v9.2.1)
* [Node.js 8 (LTS "Carbon")](/en/blog/release/v8.9.3)
* [Node.js 6 (LTS "Boron")](/en/blog/release/v6.12.2)
* [Node.js 4 (LTS "Argon")](/en/blog/release/v4.8.7)

## [Data Confidentiality/Integrity Vulnerability - CVE-2017-15896](#data-confidentialityintegrity-vulnerability---cve-2017-15896)

Node.js was affected by OpenSSL vulnerability CVE-2017-3737 in regards to the use of SSL\_read() due to TLS handshake failure. The result was that an active network attacker could send application data to Node.js using the TLS or HTTP2 modules in a way that bypassed TLS authentication and encryption.

* The original HTTP module was not affected.
* The vulnerability in the HTTP2 module (which only existing in the 8.X and 9.X lines) was fixed through [nodejs/node@f3686f2](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/f3686f2a4dc017d998a057f7fa6107e36a721641). HTTP2 was previously exploitable through the submission of malicious data by an attacker.
* The vulnerability in the TLS module was fixed by incorporating OpenSSL-1.0.2n into Node.js. We are not currently aware of any exploits but it was previously at a severe security risk of accepting unauthenticated data. See this advisory from OpenSSL for more details on the fixes in OpenSSL-1.0.2n [secadv-20171207.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt).
* The HTTPS module was not affected.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2017-15896.

We would like to thank Matt Caswell (OpenSSL) and David Benjamin (Google) for reporting this.

## [Uninitialized buffer vulnerability - CVE-2017-15897](#uninitialized-buffer-vulnerability---cve-2017-15897)

Node.js had a bug in versions 8.X and 9.X which caused buffers to not be initialized when the encoding for the fill value did not match the encoding specified. For example, 'Buffer.alloc(0x100, "This is not correctly encoded", "hex");' The buffer implementation was updated such that the buffer will be initialized to all zeros in these cases.

Versions 4.X and 6.X were **not** vulnerable.

The severity of this information disclosure vulnerability was low (due to the combination of coding errors that need to have been made in order to make it exploitable) and it has been assigned CVE-2017-15897.

## [Also included in OpenSSL update - CVE 2017-3738](#also-included-in-openssl-update---cve-2017-3738)

Note that CVE 2017-3738 of OpenSSL-1.0.2 affected Node but it was low severity as described in [secadv-20171207.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt).

## [Summary](#summary-1)

The Node.js project will be releasing new versions of 4.x, 6.x, 8.x and 9.x as soon as possible after the OpenSSL release, on or soon after December 8th UTC, to incorporate a security fix.

## [Data Confidentiality/Integrity Vulnerability](#data-confidentialityintegrity-vulnerability)

All versions of 4.x, 6.x, 8.x and 9.x are vulnerable to an issue to be fixed in the forthcoming OpenSSL-1.0.2n released on Dec 7, see <https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2017-December/000108.html> for more details. The severity of this vulnerability of Node.js is HIGH (due to the way Node.js uses the OpenSSL APIs) and users of the affected versions should plan to upgrade when a fix is made available.

## [Impact](#impact)

* Versions 4.0 and later of Node.js are vulnerable
* Versions 6.0 and later of Node.js are vulnerable
* Versions 8.0 and later of Node.js are vulnerable
* Versions 9.0 and later of Node.js are vulnerable

## [Release timing](#release-timing)

Releases will be available as soon as possible after the OpenSSL release, along with disclosure of the details for the vulnerability in order to allow for complete impact assessment by users.
