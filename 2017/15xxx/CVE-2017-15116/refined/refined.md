  "CVE-2017-15116": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2017-15116",
      "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's random number generator API. A null pointer dereference in the rngapi_reset function may result in denial of service, crashing the system."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `rngapi_reset` function within the Linux kernel's random number generator (RNG) API.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Null pointer dereference"
      ],
      "Impact": "A successful exploit would cause a denial of service due to a system crash.",
      "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector isn't detailed, but it involves interaction with the `rngapi_reset` function which implies it's related to setting up/resetting the RNG. This interaction can likely happen through a system call or interface related to the kernel RNG.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker would require the ability to trigger the vulnerable `rngapi_reset` function. This likely involves having access to a system interface to request a reset of the RNG.",
       "Additional Information": "The provided information indicates the vulnerability is related to how the kernel handles a reset with a seed size of zero. The fix involves a check for a zero seed length, and then appropriately setting seed to null, to avoid a dereference of a null pointer. The vulnerability has been fixed in various Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions as identified in the errata (RHSA-2018:0676, RHSA-2018:1062)."
