Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2017-15012:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The OpenText Documentum Content Server does not properly validate input to the `PUT_FILE` RPC command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The server fails to sanitize or validate the file path provided in the `PUT_FILE` command.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to download arbitrary files from the Content Server's filesystem.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Because some files on the Content Server filesystem contain sensitive information, this vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download sensitive files from the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, scripts), an attacker can escalate their privileges on the server, potentially gaining full administrative control.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via RPC commands to the Content Server.
*   **Authentication Required:**  The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the Content Server.
*   **Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited using the `PUT_FILE` RPC-command. By crafting a malicious file path and sending it through the command, an attacker can retrieve arbitrary files from the server.
*   **Path Traversal:** The provided exploit uses path traversal "../" in the remote file path to download files outside of the intended file storage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the OpenText Documentum Content Server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The provided exploit script demonstrates how an authenticated user can download sensitive files, like `dm_set_server_env.sh` and `dfc.keystore` which ultimately leads to privilege escalation.
*   The exploit code uses the path traversal technique to access arbitrary files on the server file system.
* The provided python script shows that after obtaining the `dfc.keystore` file, the attacker can connect to the server as a superuser using the `r_install_owner` account.
