Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-15405:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Symlink traversal in cryptohomed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a symlink traversal issue, which allows an attacker to potentially bypass intended access controls by manipulating symbolic links.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is not explicitly detailed, but symlink traversal vulnerabilities generally allow an attacker to read or write to arbitrary locations on the file system, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data compromise, or denial of service. The provided content labels the severity as "High".

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting a flaw in how the `cryptohomed` component handles symbolic links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The specific attacker capabilities are not detailed in the provided text. However, the ability to create or modify symlinks within the context of the vulnerable `cryptohomed` component is likely required.
