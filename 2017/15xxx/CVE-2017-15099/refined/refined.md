  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient checks in the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` command, where it fails to enforce SELECT privileges and bypasses row-level security policies. This allows an attacker to potentially disclose or modify data they are not authorized to access.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient authorization checks.",
        "Bypass of row-level security policies.",
         "Failure to enforce SELECT privileges in `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` commands."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially disclose or modify database content that they do not have permission to access. This may include sensitive information and can compromise data integrity.",
      "attack_vectors": "`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` command. The attacker needs to have both INSERT and UPDATE privileges on the targeted table.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute SQL queries. Specifically, they need INSERT and UPDATE privileges on the target table, but not necessarily SELECT privileges. They also need to be able to trigger the affected code path.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass row-level security and lack of SELECT privileges by using the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` command. This allows disclosure of certain columns, even if full read access is not available. The fix enforces permission checks on indexes and row-level policies before the update is executed."
