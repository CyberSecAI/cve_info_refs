## Description

[![@NickJosevski](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119096?u=11252e50e6c1f65deb5b9774f880dc4fb65a6d54&v=4&size=48)](/NickJosevski)[NickJosevski](https://github.com/NickJosevski)opened [on Oct 17, 2017](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/3864#issue-265986941)
## Summary

To further reflect the intention of the power of `UserInvite` it will now require additional privileges to be granted.

## Reasoning

By inviting a user to an existing team, the user is editing a team, and causing the creation of a user. This would allow them to invite a user to a team with greater privilege than their own. To make it clear they will now require `TeamEdit` which makes it more obvious the power of this action.

### CVE
