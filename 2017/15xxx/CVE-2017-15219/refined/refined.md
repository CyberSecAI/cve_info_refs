- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in multiple sections, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, which could lead to malicious redirects, crypto-currency mining, or the deployment of exploit kits.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects JavaScript code into various input fields within the application, including the "Title" parameter in vanity URLs, the "Description" parameter in containers, and the "Description" parameter in templates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application with the ability to create or edit "Vanity URLs," "Containers," or "Templates".
