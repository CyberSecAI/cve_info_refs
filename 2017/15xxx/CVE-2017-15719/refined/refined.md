Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the WYSIWYG editor component of the `wicket-jquery-ui` library and `wicket-kendo-ui`. It allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing the execution of malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Other attacks that can be performed via JavaScript code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker submits malicious JavaScript code via the WYSIWYG editor. This payload is then stored by the application and executed when the page is rendered and displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the WYSIWYG editor and inject malicious content.
*   The attacker may not necessarily require any specific privileges in the system; any user who can enter data via the vulnerable component might be able to trigger the XSS attack.

**Affected Components:**
