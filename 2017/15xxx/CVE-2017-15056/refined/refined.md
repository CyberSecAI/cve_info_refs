The content is related to CVE-2017-15056.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An invalid pointer read occurs in the `PackLinuxElf64::unpack()` function while decompressing a crafted binary. This occurs in the `get_le32` function when reading a 32-bit little-endian value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: When decompressing a crafted binary, the code attempts to read memory outside the allocated buffer.
- Segmentation Fault (SEGV): The crafted binary can cause a segmentation fault due to an invalid memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program termination: The vulnerability can cause the UPX executable to crash.
- Denial of service: By providing a crafted binary, an attacker can force the UPX tool to crash, thus denying service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor can provide a crafted binary to the UPX tool for decompression.
- The decompression process will attempt to read beyond allocated memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted binary to the UPX tool.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the system where UPX is being run.
