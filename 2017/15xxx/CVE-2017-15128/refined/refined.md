Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15128:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing size check in the `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte` function within the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs (huge page file system) implementation. Specifically, when copying data using `UFFDIO_COPY` with userfaultfd, there was no verification to ensure that the copy operation did not exceed the allocated size of the huge page file's inode (`i_size`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Access:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write. When `UFFDIO_COPY` is used to populate a hugetlbfs mapping, `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte` could write beyond the intended boundary of the file, leading to memory corruption.
- **Missing Size Check:** The root cause is the lack of a size check in `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte` before copying data, which should have been done against the i_size of the hugetlbfs file.
- **Userfaultfd Abuse:** The vulnerability is triggered by abusing the userfaultfd system call in conjunction with hugetlbfs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic:**  The primary observed impact is a kernel panic due to memory corruption.  Specifically, an out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash during operations like `remove_inode_hugepages`. The provided crash trace shows a kernel BUG at `fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:484` within the `remove_inode_hugepages` function.
- **Denial of Service:** This vulnerability can result in a denial-of-service condition due to the kernel crash.
- **Potential for other issues**: While a panic is the main impact, memory corruption could potentially lead to other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker requires local access to the system, specifically a shell account.
- **Userfaultfd and hugetlbfs:** The vulnerability is triggered by using `UFFDIO_COPY` with a hugetlbfs mapping that is larger than the file backing it. The attacker must be able to trigger userfaultfd to populate the mapping

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local shell account on the target system.
- The attacker must be able to use the userfaultfd syscall.
- The attacker has to have the ability to create or modify hugetlbfs mappings, which might require some elevated privileges or access to existing hugetlbfs files.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding size checks within `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte` to ensure that the copy operation does not extend beyond the file's `i_size`. This is done by comparing the index to the current size.
- The provided commit log from the fix emphasizes that mmap() can succeed beyond i_size after vmtruncate, but faults must not, including UFFDIO_COPY.
- The fix also adds a recheck of i_size after the page table lock is acquired.
