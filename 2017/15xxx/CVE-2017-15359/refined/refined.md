Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-15359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the 3CX Phone System. It exists due to insufficient input validation on the `file` parameter within the `/api/RecordingList/DownloadRecord` and `/api/SupportInfo` endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied file paths, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system. The provided example demonstrates how to access the `3CXPhoneSystem.ini` file, which contains sensitive configuration information like database credentials, API keys, and other critical parameters. This exposed information could be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specifically crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoints, providing a manipulated file path through the `file` parameter.
   - Specifically: `/api/SupportInfo?file=/path/to/file` and `/api/RecordingList/DownloadRecord?file=/path/to/file`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the 3CX Phone System's Management Console.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the 3CX Phone System, typically on port 5001.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable version is 3CX Phone System 15.5.3554.1, running on a Debian based installation.
- The exploit was discovered during a penetration test.
- The vendor was notified and confirmed the vulnerability, with a fix expected in a future release.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.8, categorized as "Medium" severity. The CVSS vector is CVSS3#AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating a network-based attack vector with low attack complexity, requiring high privileges, no user interaction and a changed scope, with high impact on confidentiality.
