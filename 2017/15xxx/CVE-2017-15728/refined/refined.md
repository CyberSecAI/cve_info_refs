Based on the provided commit diff, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-configurable settings within the phpMyFAQ admin panel, specifically the `main.titleFAQ`, `metaDescription` and `metaKeywords` settings. These settings were being inserted into the HTML output without proper escaping, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of output sanitization, which leads to a stored XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the admin settings, which will then execute within the browsers of users accessing the front-end of the application.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The configuration settings in the admin interface allow for arbitrary text including HTML tags and scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the browser of a user visiting the FAQ. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information by injecting scripts that collect and exfiltrate data.
- **Account Compromise:** If an administrator views the injected content, the attacker could potentially gain access to their account through session hijacking or other XSS-based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Panel Compromise:** An attacker with access to the phpMyFAQ admin panel could insert malicious code into the configuration settings (e.g., `main.titleFAQ`, `metaDescription`, `metaKeywords`).
- **Persistent XSS:** The malicious code is stored in the database and will execute every time a user views the affected sections of the FAQ.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the phpMyFAQ instance to modify the configuration settings.

**Technical Details from the Commit:**

- **`phpmyfaq/admin/configuration.php`:** The diff in this file is simply adding the missing configuration options for `main.titleFAQ`, `metaDescription`, and `metaKeywords` to be configurable.
- **`phpmyfaq/index.php`:** The critical change here is the addition of `PMF_String::htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize the values retrieved from the configuration for `header`, `metaDescription`, and `metaKeywords` before outputting them in the HTML of the page. This is what mitigates the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix specifically addresses the lack of sanitization when retrieving the configuration values for `main.titleFAQ`, `metaDescription` and `metaKeywords` in `index.php`. The `htmlspecialchars()` function is used to prevent HTML and JavaScript code from being interpreted by the browser.
- The original code was vulnerable as it did not escape the user-supplied content, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts that would execute in the context of the website.
- The commit message "Fixed possible admin XSS attack vector" confirms the nature of the vulnerability.
