{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of a search filter in `slapi_filter_sprintf` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `slapi_filter_sprintf` function within `slapd/util.c`. This function does not properly handle specific LDAP search filters, leading to memory corruption.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the `ns-slapd` process to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted LDAP request with a malicious search filter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send LDAP requests."
