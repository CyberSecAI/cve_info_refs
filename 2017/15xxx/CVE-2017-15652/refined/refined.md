Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `filenameforall` command within Ghostscript, which can bypass the `-dSAFER` restriction designed to limit file system access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of -dSAFER:** The `filenameforall` command, even when `-dSAFER` is enabled, allows listing of files outside of the allowed directories. This bypass undermines the intended security restriction.
- **Path Traversal:** By providing a specially crafted path such as `/usr/share/fonts/../../../../../../../../etc/*`, an attacker can access files in directories not intended to be accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially list the files in sensitive directories they shouldn't have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a crafted PostScript file that includes a `filenameforall` command with directory traversal paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or have the target process a malicious PostScript file to the Ghostscript interpreter.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the path traversal vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes the specific PostScript code that demonstrates the vulnerability:
    ```
    %!PS
    (/usr/share/fonts/../../../../../../../../etc/*) {print (\n) print} 1024 string filenameforall quit
    ```
- The issue is resolved in the commit `2fc463d0e` of the ghostpdl repository.
