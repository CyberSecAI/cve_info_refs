The provided content is related to the fix for CVE-2017-15731.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism in the admin log deletion functionality of phpMyFAQ.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CSRF protection. Without a CSRF token, an attacker can trick an administrator into unknowingly performing an action, such as deleting the admin logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could force an administrator to delete the admin logs through a CSRF attack.
- Deleting the logs can remove crucial audit trail information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a CSRF attack. This involves tricking an authenticated administrator to send a request to the application to delete the logs without their consent. This could be done by embedding a malicious link or form in a webpage/email that is visited/viewed by the administrator.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking on a malicious link or form that triggers the delete admin log functionality. The attacker needs no prior knowledge about the CSRF token, since the token wasn't checked previously. The attacker needs to be aware of the location of the vulnerable admin log deletion functionality.

**Additional Details:**
The commit `fadb9a70b5f7624a6926b8834d5c6001c210f09c` introduces a fix by:
- Adding a CSRF token check before deleting the logs.
- Generating the CSRF token using `$user->getCsrfTokenFromSession()`
- Passing the CSRF token to the delete admin log link.
- Check whether the CSRF token passed via GET parameter is identical to the CSRF token in the session via `$csrfToken = PMF_Filter::filterInput(INPUT_GET, 'csrf', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);` and `if (!isset($_SESSION['phpmyfaq_csrf_token']) || $_SESSION['phpmyfaq_csrf_token'] !== $csrfToken)`
