Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities in Kanboard <= 1.0.46:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper authorization checks when processing form data. The application was not verifying if an authenticated user had the necessary permissions to modify data related to private projects of other users. By manipulating the form data (specifically the IDs of project resources) in HTTP requests, an attacker could bypass access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

Multiple vulnerabilities were present, all stemming from the same root cause:

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application used predictable IDs to identify project resources such as projects, tasks, categories, columns, etc. This allowed attackers to modify resources they should not have access to.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application failed to verify that a user had permission to perform actions on specific project resources. This included creating, modifying, and deleting resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An authenticated user could perform the following actions on private projects of other users:

*   Edit project details (Name, Email, Identifier, Description, etc.)
*   Add new tasks
*   Edit columns
*   Add/edit/remove categories
*   Edit swimlanes
*   Edit/view/add/remove tags
*   Add/remove automatic actions
*   Edit tasks
*   Add external/internal links to tasks
*   Download/view thumbnails/remove attachments

In essence, an authenticated user could fully compromise the integrity and confidentiality of other users' private projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector for all these vulnerabilities was manipulating form data in HTTP requests. The attacker would need to:

1.  Be an authenticated user of Kanboard.
2.  Identify the IDs of resources belonging to another user's private project.
3.  Craft HTTP requests with manipulated form data, replacing the IDs of their own project resources with the target userâ€™s.
4.  Submit the request to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the Kanboard instance.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the target user's project or the ability to enumerate project resource IDs
*   The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests with modified form data.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content includes two specific commit messages:

*   `074f6c104f3e49401ef0065540338fc2d4be79f0`: "Avoid people to alter other projects by changing form data" - This commit addresses vulnerabilities related to project data manipulation.
*   `3e0f14ae2b0b5a44bd038a472f17eac75f538524`: "Do not expose IDs in forms" - This commit addresses vulnerabilities related to exposing IDs in the forms, which could aid in unauthorized access.

The fixes involve adding proper authorization checks in various controllers of the application, specifically within the `BaseController.php` file using methods such as `getColumn`, `getSwimlane`, `getCategory`, `getProjectTag` and `getAction` to ensure the user has permission to access the specified resource before processing the request.

The identified vulnerabilities were fixed in Kanboard version 1.0.47.
