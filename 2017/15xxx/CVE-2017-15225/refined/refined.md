{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory leak in the `nm` utility of binutils.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `nm` utility fails to free allocated memory for hash tables used in DWARF2 debugging information processing (`funcinfo_hash_table` and `varinfo_hash_table`).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The memory leak can lead to increased memory consumption when analyzing large or multiple ELF files using `nm`. This could cause performance degradation and potentially lead to denial-of-service if memory is exhausted.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by using the `nm` utility with specific options that involve processing DWARF2 debug information.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to execute the `nm` utility on a target system with a specially crafted or large ELF file."
