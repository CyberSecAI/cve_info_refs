Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper authorization checks in Kanboard <= 1.0.46. Specifically, the application was not adequately verifying if an authenticated user had the necessary permissions to perform actions on resources belonging to other users' private projects. This allowed users to bypass intended access controls by manipulating form data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application was relying on user-supplied IDs in form data without proper authorization checks, enabling users to access and modify resources they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Missing Authorization:** The system lacked robust checks to ensure users could only access and modify project data associated with their own projects. The application failed to verify the association between the requested resource and the user's permissions before performing actions.
*   **Form Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify hidden form fields like IDs in order to bypass authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An authenticated user could perform the following actions on another user's private projects:

*   Modify project details (name, email, description, identifier, etc.)
*   Add, edit, and remove tasks
*   Add, edit, and remove columns
*   Add, edit, and remove categories
*   Edit swimlanes
*   Edit tags
*   Add and remove automatic actions
*   View tag names
*   Download and remove attachments
*   View image thumbnails
*   Add external and internal links

This could lead to data breaches, data tampering, and disruption of project management for other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Manipulation:** Attackers intercept and alter HTTP POST requests, changing the IDs of the targeted project, category, column, etc., to those of another user's private project.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Kanboard system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Kanboard instance.
*   **Knowledge of Target IDs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the IDs of resources (projects, tasks, columns, etc.) belonging to other users' private projects. In some cases, the name of tags might be sufficient to exploit some of the issues.
*   **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Requests:** The attacker should be able to intercept and modify the HTTP requests sent by the browser, using tools like a proxy or browser developer tools.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided patches focus on implementing authorization checks within the `BaseController` and various other controllers, ensuring that actions can only be performed on resources belonging to the current user's projects.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by checking if the resource (category, column, etc.) belongs to the current user's project and raising an exception if it does not.
*   The fix also includes removing direct IDs from forms to avoid manipulation.
*   Multiple CVEs could be assigned to each vulnerability, or all of them could be addressed by one CVE.
