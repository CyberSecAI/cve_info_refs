Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `photo` parameter within the Shareet photo-sharing social network application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to the unsanitized `photo` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive information).
    - Data modification or deletion.
    - Privilege escalation (gaining higher levels of access within the application).
    - Denial of service by disrupting the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through the `photo` parameter in a GET request. The application processes this parameter without sufficient sanitization.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker directly manipulates the URL by injecting malicious SQL code into the `photo` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the Application's URL Structure:** The attacker needs to know the URL containing the vulnerable parameter, in this case the `photo` parameter.
- **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit does not require authentication, making it exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as an AND/OR time-based blind SQL injection.
- A sample payload is given: `photo=saSihSiRf1E' AND SLEEP(5) AND 'DUqs'='DUqs` which demonstrates a time-based SQL injection.

**Additional Notes**
- The vendor released a fix for SQL Injection in version 1.0.4 but the provided information does not specify if this vulnerability is patched in that version.
- The application is a PHP based web application.
- The application uses a MySQL database.
