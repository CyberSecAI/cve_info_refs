Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-15635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in various Lua files of TP-Link routers. Specifically for CVE-2017-15635, the vulnerability lies in the `session_limits.lua` file where the `max_conn` variable is not properly validated. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through this variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By injecting malicious commands into the `max_conn` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the router's operating system.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Lua scripts lack proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router. This means they can take full control of the device.
*   **Full Device Compromise:** With command execution, attackers can perform various malicious activities, including:
    *   Modifying router settings
    *   Installing malware
    *   Joining the router to a botnet
    *   Intercepting network traffic
    *   Exfiltrating data
    *   Denial of service
*   **Lateral Movement:** A compromised router can be used as a pivot point to attack other devices within the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Management Interface:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through the web management interface, specifically through HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/luci` endpoint.
*   **Specific Lua File:** The specific vulnerable file for CVE-2017-15635 is `session_limits.lua` and the vulnerable variable is `max_conn`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator on the router's web management panel. This means they need to have the correct username and password.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This could be from the local network (LAN) or remotely (WAN) if the "remote management" feature is enabled.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker needs to craft a specific HTTP POST request containing the malicious payload within the `max_conn` parameter of `session_limits.lua`.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable endpoint `/cgi-bin/luci` and the structure of the requests.

**Summary of CVE-2017-15635 Details:**
The content provides details about CVE-2017-15635, pinpointing the `max_conn` variable within the `session_limits.lua` file as the injection point, and indicates that successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution. This aligns with the nature of command injection vulnerabilities.

The content also provides a proof-of-concept for another related CVE-2017-15616 but explains that other vulnerabilities can be reproduced with the similar method, changing the parameter and affected file. This method could be used to create a PoC for CVE-2017-15635.
