Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in the NQ Contacts Backup & Restore application:

**Vulnerability 1: Lack of HTTPS usage**
   * **Root Cause:** The application transmits data, including login credentials, over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
   * **Weaknesses:**
        *   Plaintext transmission of sensitive data.
        *   Use of SHA-1 hashing for passwords which is considered weak.
   * **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure of usernames transmitted in cleartext.
        *   Potential compromise of user accounts by cracking the SHA-1 password hash.
        *   Unauthorized access to stored contacts by using sniffed hash.
   * **Attack Vectors:** Network sniffing.
   * **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network).

**Vulnerability 2: RC4 encryption with static key**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses the RC4 stream cipher with a static key to encrypt/decrypt passwords stored locally in shared preferences.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
         * Usage of a weak stream cipher (RC4)
         * Use of a static key for encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Easy decryption of locally stored passwords, enabling unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Access to the device's file system.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires access to the device's shared preferences XML file.

**Vulnerability 3: DES encryption with static key**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application encrypts contact data using DES with a static key during sync with the remote server.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
         * Use of DES (a weak symmetric encryption algorithm).
         * Use of static keys for data encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user's contact data, that is transmitted over the network unencrypted.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Network sniffing and access to the application.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker can eavesdrop on the network traffic.

The blog post provides more detail about the vulnerabilities than the typical CVE description. The issues include insecure transport (HTTP), weak hashing (SHA-1), and weak cryptography using static keys (RC4 and DES).
