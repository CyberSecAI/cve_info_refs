- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DBS3900 TDD LTE device supports SSL/TLS protocol negotiation using insecure encryption algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of weak encryption algorithms during SSL/TLS negotiation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crack the encrypted data and cause information leakage.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
