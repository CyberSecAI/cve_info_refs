{
  "CVE-2017-15614": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the `new-outif` variable within the `pptp_client.lua` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through this parameter.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected TP-Link router.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the router's web management interface, specifically to the `pptp_client.lua` file, including the malicious `new-outif` parameter."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials to access the web management interface of the TP-Link router. The attack can be performed from the LAN or WAN (if remote management is enabled)."
