The provided content is related to CVE-2017-15339.

**Summary:**

This document is a security advisory from Huawei regarding multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the SIP module of several Huawei products. The specific vulnerability related to CVE-2017-15339 is one of three buffer overflows identified and addressed in this advisory, alongside CVE-2017-15337 and CVE-2017-15338

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient validation of values within SIP messages. This lack of validation allows an attacker to send specially crafted SIP messages that can cause a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the SIP module.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate the length or content of specific fields within SIP messages before processing them.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities can lead to abnormal service behavior and potential service disruption. The advisory does not specify the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE), only that it can lead to "services abnormal".

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is sending specially crafted SIP messages to affected Huawei products.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to gain access to the network where the affected products are located, so they must be in the network or have network access.
* The attacker must be able to craft and send specific SIP messages to the vulnerable service

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory lists affected products and software versions along with the corresponding fixes.
*   It also provides CVSS v3 base and temporal scores for the vulnerabilities. The vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-15339 is one of three, sharing the identifier group HWPSIRT-2017-04055, HWPSIRT-2017-04056, and HWPSIRT-2017-04057.
*   The document states that the vulnerabilities were discovered by Huawei internal testers.
*   The advisory includes a contact method for customers to request upgrades.
