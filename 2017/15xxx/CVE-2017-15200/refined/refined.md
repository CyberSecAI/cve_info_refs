Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user input and lack of proper authorization checks when processing form data. This allows authenticated users to manipulate form parameters (such as project IDs) to perform actions on resources (projects, tasks, categories, etc.) they do not have permission to access, specifically, private projects of other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the project IDs or other resource identifiers submitted through form data. This allows an attacker to substitute a valid project ID with another one they do not have access to.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The application doesn't properly verify if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action on the specified resource. It relies on the submitted form data without proper access control checks.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The application uses the provided resource IDs directly, without first verifying the user's authorization to operate on those resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can perform the following actions on private projects of other users:

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   View names of project tags.
    *   Download attachments from private projects
    *   See thumbnails of pictures from private projects.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:**
    *   Edit project details (name, email, identifier, description).
    *   Add new tasks to private projects.
    *   Edit project columns, categories, swimlanes and tags.
    *   Add automatic actions to private projects.
    *   Edit tasks within private projects.
    *   Add external and internal links to tasks within private projects
*   **Data Manipulation:**
    *   Remove columns, categories, tags and automatic actions from private projects.
    *   Remove attachments from private projects

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves manipulating form data sent to the application. An authenticated user can intercept and modify HTTP requests, altering parameters such as project IDs, to target resources that belong to other users and for which they do not have permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the Kanboard application.
*   The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests sent to the server.
*   The attacker must be familiar with the application's form structure and parameters.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content includes links to the specific commits that fixed the issues, indicating that the developers addressed the vulnerability by implementing proper validation and authorization checks. The fix was released in Kanboard version 1.0.47.

The attacker could download attachments from private projects and see thumbnails of pictures from private projects, which represents unauthorized access to sensitive data, and they could remove attachments from projects, which represents a denial of service.

The attacker could also edit tasks from private projects, which represents unauthorized modification of sensitive data.

The email also suggests that the reported vulnerabilities can be grouped under a single CVE.

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided information directly relates to the issues described as privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Kanboard versions 1.0.46 and prior, and specifically addresses the issues that were fixed in the referenced commits, making it relevant to CVE-2017-15200.
