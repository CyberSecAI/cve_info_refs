{
  "CVE-2017-15010": {
    "Description": "A regular expression denial of service flaw was found in Tough-Cookie. An attacker able to make an application using Tough-Cookie to parse a sufficiently large HTTP request Cookie header could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a vulnerable regular expression used for parsing cookies. Specifically, a regex with unbounded repetition can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing a large, specially crafted HTTP Cookie header.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)",
      "Catastrophic backtracking"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause an application using the vulnerable library to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a large, malicious Cookie header."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an application using the vulnerable tough-cookie library."
  }
