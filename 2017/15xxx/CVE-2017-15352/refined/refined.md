- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control due to incorrectly restricted access to a resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, allowing unauthorized access to resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker may query information or send specific messages, leading to service abnormalities.
- **Attack vectors:** Local Area Network (LAN) access to the target device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have access to the LAN where the target device resides.
    - The affected device must support the virtual machine (VM) feature (OceanStor 5300 V3 and later with 32 GB memory or higher).
    - The VM feature must be enabled.
    - The attacker needs administrator privileges and access to the DeviceManager.
