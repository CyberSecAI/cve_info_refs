Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15601:

**CVE Description:** The provided content doesn't include an official CVE description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the `stndup` function within `png_extractor.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `stndup` function allocates memory based on a size `n`, then attempts to copy `n` bytes into the newly allocated buffer and adds a null terminator.
- The vulnerability occurs in `stndup` function, where a single byte is written outside the allocated buffer. Specifically, the code writes to `tmp[n]` after allocating `n + 1` bytes for `tmp`. This will write 1 byte before the start of the memory allocated to `tmp` leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The heap-based buffer overflow can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) as observed in the provided AddressSanitizer output. It's also indicated that other unspecified impacts are possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PNG file.
- The `extract` command-line tool is used to process the malicious file, which triggers the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PNG file to a system using the vulnerable `libextractor` library.
- The attacker must be able to execute the `extract` tool on the target system, or trigger the vulnerable library through another application that utilizes it.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided crash information from AddressSanitizer pinpoints the exact line of code within `stndup` at `png_extractor.c` that triggers the overflow, and identifies that a single byte is written outside of the allocated buffer.
- The vulnerable version identified is libextractor v1.4, and the Debian security advisory mentions a fix in version 1:0.6.3-5+deb7u1 for Debian 7.
- The advisory also mentions other CVEs related to libextractor, indicating multiple vulnerabilities in the library at that time.
