## Description

[![@michaelnoonan](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1627582?v=4&size=48)](/michaelnoonan)[michaelnoonan](https://github.com/michaelnoonan)opened [on Oct 18, 2017](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/3868#issue-266349606)
# Issue

See private issue for more details: <https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/issues/1378>

[CVE-2017-15610](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xhvr-qq82-mmqx "CVE-2017-15610")

Sensitive variable value is written to variable file as clear text.

Offline drop deployments generate two variable JSON files: one for normal variables which are written in clear-text, and one for sensitive variables which is encrypted using the Offline Drop Target's encryption password.

If any variable is sensitive, Octopus requires any Offline Drop Target to specify a valid encryption password, and any sensitive values will be encrypted into that file.

If your project uses complex nested bindings, the resulting values can be treated as non-sensitive and written to the clear-text variables file.

If an attacker can gain access to these offline drop files, they can gain the sensitive data without needing to decrypt it.

# Affected versions

This affects Octopus `3.2.5` up to `3.17.6`, and is fixed in Octopus `3.17.7`.

# Implemented solution

We now use the configuration of the Offline Drop Target as the switch. If the user has configured an encryption password, they have opted-in to have all their variables encrypted, regardless of whether there are any sensitive values or not.

Fixed by <https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/pull/1382>
