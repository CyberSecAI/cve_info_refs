The provided content is related to CVE-2017-15610, not CVE-2017-15609, based on the description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
-  When using Offline Drop targets in Octopus Deploy, sensitive variable values could be written in clear text to a variable file. This occurred because complex nested bindings could cause values to be incorrectly treated as non-sensitive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Sensitive data exposure due to the creation of a clear-text variables file.
-  Inconsistent handling of sensitive variables based on the complexity of bindings.
- Failure to encrypt all variables when an encryption password was configured.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker gaining access to the offline drop files could read sensitive information without needing to decrypt it.
- This could lead to the exposure of passwords, API keys, or other sensitive configuration data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who gains access to offline drop files generated by Octopus Deploy. This can happen if the storage location of these files is compromised.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to access offline drop files generated by Octopus Deploy. This could involve compromising the machine or storage location where these files are written.
