- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Telnet service allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of authentication on the Telnet service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, leading to a full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks through the Telnet protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable Telnet service. No user interaction or privileged accounts are needed.
