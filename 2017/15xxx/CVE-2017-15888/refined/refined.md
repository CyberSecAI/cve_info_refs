- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the "Custom Internet Radio List" feature of Synology Audio Station. Specifically, the `NAME` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts or HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to attacker-controlled sites, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the `NAME` parameter in the "Custom Internet Radio List" feature of Audio Station.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable application. User interaction is required, meaning that a victim user has to be viewing the injected content, in order for the payload to be executed.
