Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanity checks in the `parse_die` function within the `dwarf1.c` file of the binutils project. Specifically, there were no checks to ensure that a pointer being dereferenced was within the bounds of the allocated memory for the section. This missing validation led to out-of-bounds memory access when parsing DWARF debugging information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The lack of sanity checks before dereferencing pointers within the DWARF parsing code led to a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs because the code might attempt to access memory outside the allocated buffer based on malformed DWARF data.
- **Missing input sanitization:** The DWARF parsing routines were not properly validating input data, allowing an attacker to craft a specially crafted input file that would trigger the out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** A heap-based buffer overflow can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code by overwriting critical data on the heap.
- **Denial of service:** A less sophisticated attack might just crash the application through the out-of-bounds read/write, leading to a denial of service. This was indicated in the ASan output provided.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious input file:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input file to the `nm` tool or any other binutils utility that parses DWARF information. The `nm` utility was used to reproduce the crash in the provided examples.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply input file:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the specially crafted input file to the vulnerable tool. This could be achieved through social engineering by convincing the user to analyze the attacker's file.
- **No special privileges:** No special privileges are required for the attack.
- **Knowledge of DWARF format:** The attacker needs to understand the DWARF format to craft a malicious input file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected functions**:  The vulnerability affects the `parse_die` and `parse_line_table` functions within `dwarf1.c`.
- **Discovered by**:  Agostino Sarubbo discovered the vulnerability using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- **Fix**: The fix was to add sanity checks to ensure that pointers are within section limits before dereferencing.
- **Affected versions:** binutils versions prior to the fix are vulnerable. The specific version mentioned as vulnerable is 2.29.51.20170924, and likely past releases.
- **Reproducer:** A reproducer for the vulnerability can be found at `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00376-binutils-heapoverflow-parse_die`.
