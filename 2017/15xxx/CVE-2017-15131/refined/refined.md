Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from the `xdg-user-dirs` tool's behavior during the creation of default user directories (like Desktop, Music, etc.) within an X session. Specifically, the `xdg-user-dirs.sh` script, which is responsible for creating these directories, executes before the user's umask policy is set by the login shell. This results in directories being created with permissions that don't adhere to the system-wide umask policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect File Permissions:** User directories are created with default permissions (755), instead of respecting the system's umask which might have been configured to be more restrictive (e.g., 750). This allows potentially unwanted access.
*   **UMask Policy Bypass:** The Xsession process does not honor the system's umask policy during the directory creation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The primary risk is that user files in the XDG directories (e.g. ~/Desktop) could be inadvertently exposed to other local users on the system due to overly permissive directory permissions.
*   **STIG Compliance Violation:** This issue violates Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requirements, which mandate that users should have read and modify permissions to only their own files. This could lead to systems that require STIG compliance to fail the security checks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system can potentially access files in another user's XDG directories if the umask policy isn't honored during directory creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system.
*  **No special privileges needed:** The vulnerability is exposed during the normal X session creation when directories are created.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `xdg-user-dirs` and affects `gnome-session`.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the system umask policy is applied when creating the XDG user directories.
*   This issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 via the RHSA-2018:0842 security advisory, which included an updated `xdg-user-dirs` package.

**CVSS:**
* CVSS base score is not explicitly provided, but it is rated as "Low" severity.
