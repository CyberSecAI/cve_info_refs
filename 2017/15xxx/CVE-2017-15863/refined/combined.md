3. Vulnerability Description
==================================
During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerability in No External Links WordPress plugin.

The Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability can enable the attacker to
construct the URL that contains malicious JavaScript code. If the
administrator of the site makes a request to such an URL, the
attacker's code will be executed, with unrestricted access to the
WordPress site in question. The attacker can entice the administrator
to visit the URL in various ways, including sending the URL by email,
posting it as a part of the comment on the vulnerable site or another
forum.

3.1. Cross-Site Scripting
  Function:     echo
  Variable:     $_REQUEST['date1'], $_REQUEST['date2']
  Sample URL:
<http://vulnerablesite.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-noexternallinks%2Fwp-noexternallinks-options.php&action=stats&date1=>"><script>alert(1)</script>
  Sample URL:
<http://vulnerablesite.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-noexternallinks%2Fwp-noexternallinks-options.php&action=stats&date2=>"><script>alert(1)</script>
  File:         wp-noexternallinks\wp-noexternallinks-options.php
    ---------
    125    $date1 = $_REQUEST['date1'];
    ...
    129    $date2 = $_REQUEST['date2'];
    ...
    134    <input type="text" name="date1" value="<?php echo $date1;
?>"> <?php _e('to', 'wp-noexternallinks'); ?>
    135    <input type="text" name="date2" value="<?php echo $date2;
?>"><input type="submit"
    ---------

В версии 4.2.0 были добавлены нужные опции. Теперь можно указывать домены, ссылки на которые шифровать, не шифруя остальные. Полезный плагин.
