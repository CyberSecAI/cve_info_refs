The provided content relates to CVE-2017-15863.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the "No External Links" WordPress plugin due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin directly outputs user-controlled input from the `$_REQUEST` array, specifically the `date1` and `date2` parameters, into the HTML without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL. If a WordPress administrator clicks this manipulated URL, the attacker's script executes within the administrator's browser session. This allows the attacker to perform any action the administrator is capable of, such as creating new admin accounts, modifying content, or installing malicious plugins.
- The attacker can gain complete control over the WordPress site due to unrestricted access to the site via the admin user session.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker crafts a malicious URL by injecting JavaScript into the `date1` or `date2` parameters.
- Attackers trick a WordPress administrator to visit the malicious URL. This can be done via:
  - Sending the URL through email.
  - Posting it as part of a comment on a vulnerable website or forum.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with injected JavaScript.
- The attacker needs to persuade an authenticated administrator to visit the crafted URL.
