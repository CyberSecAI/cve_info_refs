- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted file upload and stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation in the `Asset Title` field and lack of file type/content validation during file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Unrestricted file upload:** The `Select File` field allows users with limited admin privileges to upload arbitrary files to the web server without proper validation.
  - **Stored XSS:** The `Asset Title` input field allows execution of injected payload strings, which are then stored in the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Session hijacking
  - Phishing attacks (both non-persistent and persistent)
  - External redirects to malicious sources (both non-persistent and persistent)
  - Manipulation of affected or connected application modules (both non-persistent and persistent)
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Remote exploitation through the web interface
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs a privileged web-application user account (specifically a "Limited Admin" role).
  - Medium user interaction is required.
