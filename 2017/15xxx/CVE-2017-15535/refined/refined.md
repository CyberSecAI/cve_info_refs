Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the Snappy compression library within the MongoDB wire protocol. An unspecified flaw in how Snappy is used allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service or modify server memory when wire protocol compression is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness lies in the handling of compressed data within the wire protocol when using Snappy compression. The issue is not within Snappy itself, but in how MongoDB utilizes it. The vulnerability is present when wire protocol compression is enabled using Snappy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
   - Denial of Service (DoS): The server may become unresponsive or crash.
   - Modification of Server Memory: An attacker may be able to alter data in the server's memory, potentially leading to further unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the MongoDB wire protocol. An attacker can send specially crafted, compressed data to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to a MongoDB server and send network traffic.
  - The targeted MongoDB server must have wire protocol compression enabled with the `snappy` compressor. Note that it is disabled by default in version 3.4.

**Affected Versions:**

   - MongoDB 3.2 and older: Not affected.
   - MongoDB 3.4.0 to 3.4.9: Affected if wire protocol compression is enabled. It is disabled by default.
   - MongoDB 3.5 development release: Affected because wire protocol compression is enabled by default.
   - MongoDB 3.6 and newer: Not affected because the vulnerability is patched.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability can be mitigated by:
   - Disabling wire protocol compression by setting the `networkMessageCompressors` parameter to `disabled`.
   - Upgrading to MongoDB 3.4.10 or 3.6 or later.

**Additional Information:**
The issue was initially fixed in the 3.4.10 and 3.6.0-rc0 releases. The description provides commands to check whether the compression is enabled and instructions for disabling the compression to remediate this vulnerability.
