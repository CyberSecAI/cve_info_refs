# Welcome to MongoDB's Issue Tracker

## I am a customer. Where do I create a Support case?

* MongoDB customers should always use the [Support Portal](https://support.mongodb.com) to obtain the fastest response and ensure privacy.
* MongoDB Cloud Manager or MongoDB Atlas customers should follow the Help link in Cloud Manager/ Atlas to create a ticket in the Support Portal.
* Please note: MongoDB Support no longer utilizes JIRA. Tickets opened via JIRA will not alert the Support Team and will not trigger any SLA timers.

##

## I am not a customer. Where should I ask general product or support questions?

MongoDB team members are active in community forums and you can also benefit from the experience of other MongoDB users. You should also consult our excellent [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com).

* For general questions or community support use the [MongoDB Community](https://community.mongodb.com) forums.
* StackExchange also has several sites with MongoDB topics:
  + [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb) (programming questions)
  + [DBA StackExchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/tags/mongodb) (database administration questions)
  + [ServerFault](https://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/mongodb) (server and networking questions)

##

## How do I create a feature request?

All MongoDB users can share your ideas via the [MongoDB Feedback Engine](https://feedback.mongodb.com).

##

## Which JIRA project should I use to report bugs?

* To report potential bugs in the MongoDB database server, use [Core Server (SERVER)](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER).
* For language-specific drivers (Java, C++, etc.), create a ticket for the relevant [language driver](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa?selectedCategory=10001).
* To report a product security vulnerability, please [review this reference.](https://www.mongodb.com/.well-known/security.txt)
* Unless otherwise specified, comments and attachments in public projects will be visible to the public.

##

## How can I follow or upvote an existing issue in JIRA?

If an issue already exists:

* Vote for that issue to show your support. Voting provides a helpful signal to help prioritize issues in the product/development roadmap.
* Watch an issue to subscribe to any future updates such as comments or changes in status.

## Tips for creating issues

The more information you can provide, the easier it is for us to diagnose problems and provide support:

* Search to find if the issue you are reporting has been reported previously
* Include any statement or command that reproduces the issue you are experiencing
* Mention the specific version of the database, client, and driver you are using
* Include details about your environment, e.g. O/S, software platform, hardware, etc.

### Description

**Issue Status as of Sep 27, 2017**

**ISSUE DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT**

When wire protocol compression is enabled, a malicious attacker may exploit an existing vulnerability to deny service or modify server memory. This vulnerability has been assigned *CVE-2017-15535*.

**AFFECTED VERSIONS**

* MongoDB 3.2 and older: are *not affected* by this vulnerability
* MongoDB 3.4: wire protocol compression was introduced in [~~SERVER-3018~~](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-3018 "Compression of wire protocol") and it first became available in MongoDB 3.4, but it is **disabled by default**. If wire protocol compression is enabled, *MongoDB 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 may be affected by this vulnerability*.
* MongoDB 3.5 development release: 3.5 has wire protocol compression enabled by default and is *affected* by this vulnerability.
* MongoDB 3.6 and newer: *not affected*.

**DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIATION**

MongoDB 3.4 users may use the [getCmdLineOpts](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/getCmdLineOpts/#getcmdlineopts) command to determine wire protocol compression is enabled. If the networkMessageCompressors parameter is set to snappy, a mongod node is vulnerable.

To disable wire protocol compression, users may specify disabled as the compression engine, either in the command line:

```
--networkMessageCompressors disabled

```

or, alternatively, in the mongod configuration file as:

```
 net:
 	compression:
 		compressors: disabled

```

**FIX VERSIONS**

This vulnerability is corrected in MongoDB 3.4.10 and MongoDB 3.6.
