Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15600:

**Root Cause:**
- A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `EXTRACTOR_nsf_extract_method` function within `nsf_extractor.c` of libextractor.

**Vulnerability:**
- The code attempts to access `head->magicid` without properly checking if `head` is a valid pointer. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when `memcmp` is called on the potentially null `head->magicid` pointer.

**Impact:**
- Exploitation results in a crash of the application using the library, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted NSF (Nintendo Sound Format) file can trigger the vulnerability when parsed by `libextractor`.
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious input file that causes the `head` pointer to be NULL during the extraction process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide an input NSF file to the application using libextractor. This might involve the attacker having control over files processed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by Zhao Liang of Huawei Weiran Labs.
- Patches for this vulnerability were released in libextractor version 1.6 and were backported to several Fedora releases.
- The vulnerability was also addressed in a Debian LTS security update.
- The provided crash information shows a segmentation fault within the `memcmp` function, confirming a NULL pointer dereference.
