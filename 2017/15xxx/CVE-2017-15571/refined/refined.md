Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15571:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization when rendering inline columns in the issue list, potentially allowing for the inclusion of malicious HTML tags which leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization. The `column_content` method does not adequately sanitize the data, especially when `query.inline_columns` is involved, which renders the column data.
*  **Impact:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the issue list which could then be executed in the browsers of users who view that list.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could inject malicious script through a crafted issue, a custom field, or other user controllable data, that becomes part of the `query.inline_columns` output.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to have sufficient privileges to add or modify content which then becomes part of the rendered issue list.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided GitHub commit (`273dd9cb3bcfb1e0a0b90570b3b34eafa07d67aa`) shows a fix for this vulnerability by removing the raw output. The change in `app/views/issues/_list.html.erb` suggests the vulnerability was related to how `query.inline_columns` output was being rendered. Specifically, `raw` was being used which could allow HTML and Javascript injection and was replaced with `content_tag` which is rendered in a safer way.
*   The Redmine Security Advisories page on the official Redmine website confirms that CVE-2017-15571 is one of multiple XSS vulnerabilities fixed in Redmine versions 3.2.8, 3.3.5, and 3.4.3.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4191-1 also lists CVE-2017-15571 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the update for the `redmine` package.

In summary, CVE-2017-15571 is a XSS vulnerability in Redmine caused by improper sanitization of data displayed in issue lists, specifically data from inline columns. An attacker can inject malicious scripts, which could lead to various malicious actions when a user views the issue list. The vulnerability was resolved by removing raw output and implementing proper escaping.
