{
  "CVE-2017-15265": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the ALSA sequencer subsystem while creating and deleting ports via ioctl. The `snd_seq_create_port` function creates a port object without taking a reference count, leading to a potential use-after-free if another thread deletes the port object immediately. The function `snd_seq_ioctl_create_port` attempts to use the created port object which might already be deleted by another thread.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race Condition"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with access to an ALSA sequencer device can cause a denial of service (system crash or data loss) and possibly achieve privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to ALSA sequencer device",
      "Crafted ioctl calls"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the ALSA sequencer device with the ability to make crafted ioctl calls. Requires the ability to trigger a race condition between port creation and deletion."
