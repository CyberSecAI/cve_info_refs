The content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Pandora FMS Enterprise, including one related to CVE-2017-15937.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the application's file manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows for the inclusion of remote files by exploiting vulnerable inclusion procedures within the application.
*   **File Upload Functionality:** The file manager function allows administrator users to upload files to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code execution on the web server:** By uploading and including a malicious file, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Reverse Shell:** In this case, the attacker was able to achieve a reverse shell on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a PHP file containing a system command execution vulnerability, specifically using `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`.
*   **Remote File Inclusion:** The uploaded file is then included by the server, triggering the execution of the injected PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the file manager functionality to upload malicious files.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a remote connection to the server to establish a reverse shell.
