The provided content details multiple command injection vulnerabilities in TP-Link routers, including CVE-2017-15636.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation in various Lua files used by the router's web management interface. Specifically, user-supplied values are directly used in system commands without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** Several Lua files, such as `webfilter.lua` (for CVE-2017-15636), process POST requests from the web management interface. They directly use parameters from these requests in system commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker who has already authenticated to the router's web management interface as an administrator can execute arbitrary system commands on the router's operating system.
- **Full System Compromise:** By injecting commands, an attacker could potentially achieve a variety of malicious outcomes, including gaining a remote shell, creating a backdoor, or disrupting the router's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Management Interface:** The attack vector is the router's web management interface, specifically the POST requests to the Lua files.
- **Authentication Required:** Exploitation requires prior authentication to the router's web management panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web management interface, which could be on the LAN or WAN if remote management is enabled.
- **Administrator Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid administrator credentials for the router's web management interface.

**CVE-2017-15636 Specifics:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `webfilter.lua` file, specifically related to the `new-time` variable.
- Like the other vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject commands via the `new-time` parameter of a POST request to the web interface.
