Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15286:

**Root cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference in the `tableColumnList` function within `sqlite3/shell.c`. The code initializes `azCol` to `NULL` and allocates memory for it only if the `sqlite3_step(pStmt) == SQLITE_ROW` condition is met. However, if the `PRAGMA table_info` query returns no results, the while loop is skipped, and `azCol` remains NULL. Consequently, subsequent code tries to access `azCol[0]` which results in a null pointer dereference, causing a crash.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is the dereference of a null pointer (`azCol`) when no columns are returned by the `PRAGMA table_info` query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the sqlite3 shell due to a segmentation fault. This can lead to a denial of service for applications using the vulnerable code.
- **Potential for more serious exploitation on macOS:** The description mentions that while Windows and Linux may not be as vulnerable due to protection against null pointer dereferences, macOS might be more susceptible to exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Database:** An attacker can create a malformed database (`PoC.db`) that, when queried with the `.dump` command using the affected sqlite3 shell, triggers the vulnerability by causing the `PRAGMA table_info` to return no rows, and thereby causing the null pointer dereference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to supply a malicious database:** The attacker needs the capability to provide or influence the database file opened by the `sqlite3` shell.
- **Command Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute the `sqlite3` command with the crafted database using the `.dump` command.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `sqlite3/shell.c` specifically within the `tableColumnList` function at line 3804 (in the ASAN output)
- The ASAN output clearly shows the crash location:
  `==11908==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x00000000 (pc 0x0808fb69 bp 0x00000004 sp 0xffc64550 T0)`
  `#0 0x808fb68 in tableColumnList /home/user/Desktop/fuzz/sqlite/ta/src/shell.c:3804`
- The value of `sqlite3_step(pStmt)` is 0x65 which is not equal to `SQLITE_ROW`, indicating no rows were returned.
- The problematic code is the following (simplified from provided code snippet):
```c
static char **tableColumnList(ShellState *p, const char *zTab) {
  char **azCol = 0; // Initialized to NULL
  sqlite3_stmt *pStmt;
  ...
  zSql = sqlite3_mprintf("PRAGMA table_info=%Q", zTab);
  sqlite3_prepare_v2(p->db, zSql, -1, &pStmt, 0);
  ...
  while(sqlite3_step(pStmt) == SQLITE_ROW) { // if no rows, this loop is skipped
     ... // azCol is allocated and populated here
  }
  ...
  azCol[0] = 0; // Null pointer dereference here, if while loop was skipped.
}
```

In summary, the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference due to a missing check for an empty result from `PRAGMA table_info`, leading to a crash. The vulnerability is present in the `tableColumnList` function in `sqlite3/shell.c`. An attacker can exploit this by providing a crafted database that causes the `PRAGMA` query to return no results, thus triggering the null pointer dereference.
