Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability exists due to unsanitized user-supplied input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete compromise of the database and application.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `searchCommercial.php` and `searchResidential.php` files. Specifically, the `property_type`, `city`, and `posted_by` parameters in `searchCommercial.php` and `property_type`, `city`, and `bedroom` parameters in `searchResidential.php` are vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required.
