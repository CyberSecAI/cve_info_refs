Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user-supplied values during CSV export. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user input, allowing for formula injection into the CSV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Injection (also known as Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection): The application does not sanitize input when exporting data to CSV format, allowing malicious formulas to be embedded in the CSV file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user opens the generated CSV file in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, the injected formulas are executed.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, potentially allowing an attacker to gain access to the system or perform other malicious actions like data exfiltration. In the given example, it shows that the calculator application is opened.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Inputting the malicious formula into a field (like the Name field in the Contact Us form), which is later exported to a CSV file.
- Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the admin/server/api/download.js and lib/list/getCSVData.js files in KeystoneJS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to insert data into a field that will be exported to a CSV file by an administrator.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement for the initial injection. The attacker does need to know how to trigger the export as an administrator.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific payload used for the proof of concept is: `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0`
- The vulnerability was present in KeystoneJS versions before 4.0.0-beta.7.
- A fix was implemented and released by the vendor in commit `1b791d55839ebf434e104cc9936ccb8c29019231`
- The exploit was reported by Ishaq Mohammed.
