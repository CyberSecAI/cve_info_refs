The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Pandora FMS Enterprise, and it lists CVE-2017-15936 as one of them.  The content describes a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability, which is likely what CVE-2017-15936 refers to. Here's a breakdown of the RFI vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The application allows the inclusion of remote files due to vulnerable inclusion procedures. Specifically, the manager files functionality permits administrators to upload files, and a malicious PHP file can be uploaded and then included remotely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application does not properly validate or sanitize file paths, allowing for the inclusion of externally hosted files or files uploaded by an attacker via a file manager feature.
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows for uploading of files with potentially malicious content, such as PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the web server.
- The attacker can achieve a reverse shell on the server.
- Other potential impacts mentioned are code execution on the client-side (XSS), denial of service, and sensitive information leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file via the manager files functionality.
- The attacker then triggers the inclusion of the uploaded malicious file by making a remote request that invokes the uploaded file.
- The attacker then makes a remote connection to their server, where they host a netcat listener for a reverse shell connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Administrator privileges within the Pandora FMS Enterprise application to access the manager files feature.
- Ability to upload files to the server via the web interface.
- Ability to make a remote connection to a listening server on the attackers controlled machine.
