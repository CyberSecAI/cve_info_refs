[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0654)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: kernel-alt (4.14.0). (BZ#1492717)

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.

Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715, Important, ARM)

Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5753, Important, ARM)

Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5754, Important, ARM)

* kernel: memory leak when merging buffers in SCSI IO vectors (CVE-2017-12190, Moderate)
* kernel: net: double-free and memory corruption in get\_net\_ns\_by\_id() (CVE-2017-15129, Moderate)
* kernel: Incorrect updates of uninstantiated keys crash the kernel (CVE-2017-15299, Moderate)
* kernel: Missing capabilities check in net/netfilter/nfnetlink\_cthelper.c allows for unprivileged access to systemwide nfnl\_cthelper\_list structure (CVE-2017-17448, Moderate)
* kernel: Missing namespace check in net/netlink/af\_netlink.c allows for network monitors to observe systemwide activity (CVE-2017-17449, Moderate)
* kernel: Arbitrary stack overwrite causing oops via crafted signal frame (CVE-2017-1000255, Moderate)
* kernel: Stack information leak in the EFS element (CVE-2017-1000410, Moderate)
* kernel: Race condition in sound system can lead to denial of service (CVE-2018-1000004, Moderate)
* kernel: Buffer overflow in mp\_override\_legacy\_irq() (CVE-2017-11473, Low)
* kernel: Integer overflow in futex.c:futux\_requeue can lead to denial of service or unspecified impact (CVE-2018-6927, Low)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5754; Vitaly Mayatskih for reporting CVE-2017-12190; Kirill Tkhai for reporting CVE-2017-15129; Michael Ellerman, Gustavo Romero, Breno Leitao, Paul Mackerras, and Cyril Bur for reporting CVE-2017-1000255; and Armis Labs for reporting CVE-2017-1000410.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1498067#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-03 12:35:18 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels handling of signal frame processing where any user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written.  This flaw only affects PowerPC systems running on Power8 or later processors.

# USN-3798-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

23 October 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3798-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 LTS.

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

negatively instantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-8539](/security/CVE-2015-8539))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the device

driver for XCeive xc2028/xc3028 tuners in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7913](/security/CVE-2016-7913))

Pengfei Ding (丁鹏飞), Chenfu Bao (包沉浮), and Lenx Wei (韦韬)

discovered a race condition in the generic SCSI driver (sg) of the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0794](/security/CVE-2017-0794))

Eric Biggers discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

uninstantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15299](/security/CVE-2017-15299))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the

OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18216](/security/CVE-2017-18216))

Luo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when

handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system deadlock). ([CVE-2018-1000004](/security/CVE-2018-1000004))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux

Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to

a use- after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with

access to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7566](/security/CVE-2018-7566))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the NFC Logical Link

Control Protocol (llcp) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9518](/security/CVE-2018-9518))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.161.151](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-161-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-161.211~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.161.151](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-161-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-161.211~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

negatively instantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-8539](/security/CVE-2015-8539))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the device

driver for XCeive xc2028/xc3028 tuners in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7913](/security/CVE-2016-7913))

Pengfei Ding (丁鹏飞), Chenfu Bao (包沉浮), and Lenx Wei (韦韬)

discovered a race condition in the generic SCSI driver (sg) of the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0794](/security/CVE-2017-0794))

Eric Biggers discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

uninstantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15299](/security/CVE-2017-15299))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the

OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18216](/security/CVE-2017-18216))

Luo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when

handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system deadlock). ([CVE-2018-1000004](/security/CVE-2018-1000004))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux

Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to

a use- after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with

access to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7566](/security/CVE-2018-7566))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the NFC Logical Link

Control Protocol (llcp) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9518](/security/CVE-2018-9518))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

Debian Bug     : 865303 865416

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10208

    Sergej Schumilo and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that a crafted ext4
    filesystem could trigger memory corruption when it is mounted.  A
    user that can provide a device or filesystem image to be mounted
    could use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-8824

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

CVE-2017-8831

    Pengfei Wang discovered that the saa7164 video capture driver
    re-reads data from a PCI device after validating it.  A physically
    present user able to attach a specially designed PCI device could
    use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12190

    Vitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the block layer did not
    correctly count page references for raw I/O from user-space.  This
    can be exploited by a guest VM with access to a host SCSI device
    for denial of service (memory exhaustion) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-13080

    A vulnerability was found in the WPA2 protocol that could lead to
    reinstallation of the same Group Temporal Key (GTK), which
    substantially reduces the security of wifi encryption.  This is
    one of the issues collectively known as "KRACK".

    Updates to GTKs are usually handled by the wpa package, where this
    issue was already fixed (DLA-1150-1).  However, some wifi devices
    can remain active and update GTKs autonomously while the system is
    suspended.  The kernel must also check for and ignore key
    reinstallation.

CVE-2017-14051

    "shqking" reported that the qla2xxx SCSI host driver did not
    correctly validate I/O to the "optrom" sysfs attribute of the
    devices it creates.  This is unlikely to have any security
    impact.

CVE-2017-15115

    Vladis Dronov reported that the SCTP implementation did not
    correctly handle "peel-off" of an association to another net
    namespace.  This leads to a use-after-free, which a local user can
    exploit for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that do not already
    have the sctp module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling
    it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false

CVE-2017-15265

    Michael23 Yu reported a race condition in the ALSA sequencer
    subsystem involving creation and deletion of ports, which could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with access to an ALSA
    sequencer device can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    loss) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15299

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem did not correctly
    handle update of an uninstantiated key, leading to a null
    dereference.  A local user can use this for denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-15649

    "nixioaming" reported a race condition in the packet socket
    (AF_PACKET) implementation involving rebinding to a fanout group,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with the
    CAP_NET_RAW capability can use this for denial of service (crash
    or data corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15868

    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol
    (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of the second
    socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to
    memory corruption.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16525

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB serial console
    implementation did not correctly handle disconnection of unusual
    serial devices, leading to a use-after-free.  A similar issue was
    found in the case where setup of a serial console fails.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or data corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16527

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound mixer driver did not
    correctly cancel I/O in case it failed to probe a device, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-16529

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound driver did not fully
    validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16531

CVE-2017-16535

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB core did not validate BOS
    descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device may
    be able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16536

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the cx231xx video capture driver
    did not fully validate the device endpoint configuration, which
    could lead to a null dereference.  A physically present user with
    a specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2017-16537

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the imon RC driver did not fully
    validate the device interface configuration, which could lead to a
    null dereference.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16643

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the gtco tablet driver did not
    fully validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16649

    Bjørn Mork found that the cdc_ether network driver did not
    validate the device's maximum segment size, potentially leading to
    a division by zero.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16939

    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam
    Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec (xfrm) implementation
    did not correctly handle some failure cases when dumping policy
    information through netlink.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-1000407

    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.96-2.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions
up to and including 3.2.96.  It also fixes some regressions caused by
the fix for CVE-2017-1000364, which was included in DLA-993-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# [[PATCH v3 1/7] KEYS: don't let add\_key() update an uninstantiated key](/search?l=linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org&q=subject:%22%5C%5BPATCH+v3+1%5C%2F7%5C%5D+KEYS%5C%3A+don%27t+let+add_key%5C%28%5C%29+update+an+uninstantiated+key%22&o=newest)

[Eric Biggers](/search?l=linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org&q=from:%22Eric+Biggers%22)
[Wed, 27 Sep 2017 12:52:12 -0700](/search?l=linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org&q=date:20170927)

```
From: Eric Biggers <ebigg...@google.com>

Currently, add_key() will, when passed a key that already exists, call
the key's ->update() method.  But this is heavily broken in the case
where the key is uninstantiated because it doesn't call
__key_instantiate_and_link().  Consequently, it doesn't do most of the
things that are supposed to happen when the key is instantiated, such as
setting KEY_FLAG_INSTANTIATED, clearing KEY_FLAG_USER_CONSTRUCT and
awakening tasks waiting on it, and incrementing key->user->nikeys.
```
```

It also never takes key_construction_mutex, which means that
->instantiate() can run concurrently with ->update() on the same key.
In the case of the "user" and "logon" key types this causes a memory
leak, at best.  Maybe even worse, the ->update() methods of the
"encrypted" and "trusted" key types actually just dereference a NULL
pointer when passed an uninstantiated key.

Therefore, change find_key_to_update() to return NULL if the found key
is uninstantiated, so that add_key() replaces the key rather than
instantiating it.  This seems to be better than fixing __key_update() to
call __key_instantiate_and_link(), since given all the bugs noted above
as well as that the existing behavior was undocumented and
keyctl_instantiate() is supposed to be used instead, I doubt anyone was
relying on the existing behavior.

This patch only affects *uninstantiated* keys.  For now we still allow a
negatively instantiated key to be updated (thereby positively
instantiating it), although that's broken too (the next patch fixes it)
and I'm not sure that anyone actually uses that functionality either.

Here is a simple reproducer for the bug using the "encrypted" key type
(requires CONFIG_ENCRYPTED_KEYS=y), though as noted above the bug
pertained to more than just the "encrypted" key type:

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <keyutils.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        int ringid = keyctl_join_session_keyring(NULL);

        if (fork()) {
            for (;;) {
                const char payload[] = "update user:foo 32";

                usleep(rand() % 10000);
                add_key("encrypted", "desc", payload, sizeof(payload), ringid);
                keyctl_clear(ringid);
            }
        } else {
            for (;;)
                request_key("encrypted", "desc", "callout_info", ringid);
        }
    }

It causes:
