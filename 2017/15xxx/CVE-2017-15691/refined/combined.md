Severity: Important      Vendor:   The Apache Software Foundation      Versions Affected:     - Apache UIMA DUCC releases including and prior to 2.2.2      Description.   The details of this vulnerability were reported to the Apache UIMA Private mailing list.      This  vulnerability relates to the user's browser processing of DUCC web page input data.      The javascript comprising Apache UIMA DUCC which runs in the user's browser does not sufficiently filter user supplied inputs, which may result in unintended execution of user supplied javascript code.      Mitigation:   Users are advised to upgrade these UIMA components to the following levels:     - Apache UIMA DUCC: upgrade to 3.0.0 or later      Credit: Marshall Schor       ```  * ```   CVE-2017-15691: Apache UIMA XML external entity expansion (XXE) attack exposure       Severity: Important        Vendor:   The Apache Software Foundation      Versions Affected:     - uimaj 2.x.x releases prior to 2.10.2     - uimaj 3.0.0 releases prior to 3.0.0-beta     - uima-as releases prior to 2.10.2     - uimaFIT releases prior to 2.4.0     - uimaDUCC releases prior to 2.2.2      Description.   The details of this vulnerability were reported to the Apache UIMA Private   mailing list.      This  vulnerability relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) capability   of various XML parsers. See      https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing   for more details.      UIMA as part of its configuration and operation may read XML from various   sources, which could be tainted in ways to cause inadvertent disclosure of local   files or other internal content.      Mitigation:   Users are advised to upgrade these UIMA components to the following levels or later:     - uimaj: 2.x.x upgrade to 2.10.2 or later     - uimaj: 3.x.x upgrade to 3.0.0 or later     - uima-as: upgrade to 2.10.2 or later     - uimaFIT: upgrade to 2.4.0 or later     - uimaDUCC: upgrade to 2.2.2 or later      Credit: Joern Kottmann      ``` |  | Reporting New Security Problems with Apache UIMA | | --- | | We strongly encourage people to report new security problems to the private security mailing list of the ASF Security Team, before disclosing them in a public forum.
