{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2017-15691",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the XML external entity expansion (XXE) capability of various XML parsers within Apache UIMA. The software may read XML from various sources, and if these sources are tainted with malicious content, it could lead to the inadvertent disclosure of local files or other internal content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) Processing"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of local files or other internal content, potentially leading to further attacks such as arbitrary code execution if the disclosed files contain sensitive information or executables.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves exploiting the XML parsing functionality within UIMA by providing specially crafted XML payloads that trigger the XXE vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide tainted XML to the UIMA application during its configuration or operation. This could be achieved through various means depending on how UIMA is used in the environment. In some scenarios, network access may be required to deliver the malicious payload via network-based configurations.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects uimaj 2.x.x releases prior to 2.10.2, uimaj 3.0.0 releases prior to 3.0.0-beta, uima-as releases prior to 2.10.2, uimaFIT releases prior to 2.4.0, and uimaDUCC releases prior to 2.2.2. This vulnerability was reported to the Apache UIMA private mailing list and assigned CVE-2017-15691. Red Hat has also tracked this issue under bugzilla ID 1572463. This vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Fuse 7.3.1, RHSA-2019:1545. The upstream fix for this issue is in uimaj version 2.10.2."
