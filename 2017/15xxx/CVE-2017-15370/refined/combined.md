Debian Bug     : 878808, 878810, 882144, 881121

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SoX (Sound eXchange),
a sound processing program:

CVE-2017-15370

    The ImaAdpcmReadBlock function (src/wav.c) is affected by a heap buffer
    overflow. This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers
    using a crafted WAV file to cause denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-15372

    The lsx_ms_adpcm_block_expand_i function (adpcm.c) is affected by a
    stack based buffer overflow. This vulnerability might be leveraged by
    remote attackers using a crafted audio file to cause denial of service
    (application crash).

CVE-2017-15642

    The lsx_aiffstartread function (aiff.c) is affected by a use-after-free
    vulnerability. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a
    crafted AIFF file to cause denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-18189

    The startread function (xa.c) is affected by a null pointer dereference
    vulnerability. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a
    crafted Maxis XA audio file to cause denial of service (application
    crash).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
14.4.1-5+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.
