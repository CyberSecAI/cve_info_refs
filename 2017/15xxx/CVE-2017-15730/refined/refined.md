Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism in the `admin/stat.ratings.php` file of phpMyFAQ version 2.9.8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user. Specifically, the "clear statistics" functionality in `admin/stat.ratings.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to delete all statistics (ratings data) from the phpMyFAQ application, leading to data loss for the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated admin user, will send a forged request to the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The exploit provided uses a simple HTML `<a>` tag pointing to the vulnerable URL, making it an easy attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Target User Must Be Logged In:** The attacker needs a valid admin user to be logged into phpMyFAQ while they click the malicious link.
*   **Attacker-Controlled Website:** The attacker needs a place (e.g. a website, or social media post) to host the malicious HTML file or link to it.
*   **No Direct Access to Server:** The attacker does not need direct access to the server or the application files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to create an HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in admin, would trigger the deletion of all rating statistics.
*   The fix involves adding CSRF token verification to the `clear-statistics` action, as seen in the diff provided from the commit.
*   The vulnerability is specific to phpMyFAQ 2.9.8 and is fixed in version 2.9.9.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed and documented on Exploit-DB.
