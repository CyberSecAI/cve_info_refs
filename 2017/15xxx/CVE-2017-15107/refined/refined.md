```
Root cause of vulnerability: Improper validation of wildcard synthesized NSEC records in the DNSSEC implementation of Dnsmasq.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The synthesized owner names of NSEC records are improperly used during NSEC processing, which can lead to incorrect verification of non-existence of hostnames.
- This is a flaw in the DNSSEC implementation of Dnsmasq

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can potentially prove the non-existence of a hostname when it actually exists.
- This could lead to an integrity impact, as the DNS resolution could be manipulated.
- The vulnerability can lead to denial of service by providing crafted DNS responses to a vulnerable dnsmasq server.

Attack vectors: Network-based attacks exploiting the DNS protocol.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can send crafted DNS packets to a vulnerable dnsmasq server.
