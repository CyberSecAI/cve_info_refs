Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15968:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `phpsqlsearch_genxml.php` file of the MyBuilder Clone 1.0 application. Specifically, the `subcategory` parameter within the GET request is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries through the `subcategory` parameter.
- Boolean-based blind SQL injection
- Error-based SQL injection
- Time-based blind SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, or other private information.
- They can modify or delete data within the database.
- Depending on the database configuration and privileges, attackers could potentially gain control of the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `phpsqlsearch_genxml.php` file.
- The `subcategory` parameter within the GET request acts as the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication or user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, as it can be exploited without prior authentication.
