Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15355:

**Summary:**

This document describes three buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-15354, CVE-2017-15355, and CVE-2017-15356) affecting multiple Huawei products. This analysis will focus on the details relevant to CVE-2017-15355.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient input validation of three different parameters within HTTP messages sent to the affected Huawei products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a buffer overflow, meaning that the lack of input validation allows attackers to write data beyond the allocated buffer space.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the failure to properly validate the size or content of certain parameters within HTTP messages before using them, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Abnormalities:** A successful exploit may lead to some service abnormalities. The document does not specify exactly what these might be, but it suggests that core functions of the affected products will be impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the network where the vulnerable Huawei product is located.
*   **Specially Crafted HTTP Messages:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted HTTP messages to the vulnerable device. These messages contain parameters that are crafted to cause a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the affected Huawei product.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters within the HTTP messages and how to craft messages to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions three vulnerabilities: HWPSIRT-2017-08063, HWPSIRT-2017-08064 and HWPSIRT-2017-08065, corresponding to CVE-2017-15354, CVE-2017-15355 and CVE-2017-15356, respectively.
*   The affected products include DP300, RP200, TE30, TE40, TE50, TE60 and TX50, and their specific versions are listed.
*   Huawei has released software updates to fix these vulnerabilities, and customers are advised to contact Huawei TAC to request the upgrades.

**CVSS v3 Score:**

*   Base Score: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
*   Temporal Score: 4.9 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)

This indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited over the network, requires no special user privileges, user interaction is not needed for exploitation, does not affect confidentiality or integrity, and has a low impact on availability.
