Debian Bug     : 902724 882258 879732 818497 818499 803097 802702

Busybox, utility programs for small and embedded systems, was affected
by several security vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues.

CVE-2011-5325

    A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation
    of tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the
    current working directory and then follow that symlink when
    extracting other files. This allows for a directory traversal
    attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.

CVE-2013-1813

    When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
    2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the intermediate
    directories are created with incorrect permissions.

CVE-2014-4607

    An integer overflow may occur when processing any variant of a
   "literal run" in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function. Each of these
    three locations is subject to an integer overflow when processing
    zero bytes. This exposes the code that copies literals to memory
    corruption.

CVE-2014-9645

    The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows
    local users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel
    modules via a / (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated
    by an "ifconfig /usbserial up" command or a "mount -t /snd_pcm none
    /" command.

CVE-2016-2147

    Integer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
    malformed RFC1035-encoded domain name, which triggers an
    out-of-bounds heap write.

CVE-2016-2148

    Heap-based buffer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox
    allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors
    involving OPTION_6RD parsing.

CVE-2017-15873

    The get_next_block function in archival/libarchive
    /decompress_bunzip2.c in BusyBox has an Integer Overflow that may
    lead to a write access violation.

CVE-2017-16544

    In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox, the tab
    autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames
    in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing
    any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result
    in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.

CVE-2018-1000517

    BusyBox contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in
    Busybox wget that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow.
    This attack appears to be exploitable via network connectivity.

CVE-2015-9621

    Unziping a specially crafted zip file results in a computation of an
    invalid pointer and a crash reading an invalid address.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.22.0-9+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your busybox packages.

This is likely a write access violation, I did not try to exploit this so I don't know how bad it is. Leads to a crash at least.  Attached are two crash files and the fuzzer info.

Debian Bug     : 902724 882258 879732 818497 818499 803097 802702

Busybox, utility programs for small and embedded systems, was affected
by several security vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues.

CVE-2011-5325

    A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation
    of tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the
    current working directory and then follow that symlink when
    extracting other files. This allows for a directory traversal
    attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.

CVE-2013-1813

    When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
    2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the intermediate
    directories are created with incorrect permissions.

CVE-2014-4607

    An integer overflow may occur when processing any variant of a
   "literal run" in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function. Each of these
    three locations is subject to an integer overflow when processing
    zero bytes. This exposes the code that copies literals to memory
    corruption.

CVE-2014-9645

    The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows
    local users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel
    modules via a / (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated
    by an "ifconfig /usbserial up" command or a "mount -t /snd_pcm none
    /" command.

CVE-2016-2147

    Integer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
    malformed RFC1035-encoded domain name, which triggers an
    out-of-bounds heap write.

CVE-2016-2148

    Heap-based buffer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox
    allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors
    involving OPTION_6RD parsing.

CVE-2017-15873

    The get_next_block function in archival/libarchive
    /decompress_bunzip2.c in BusyBox has an Integer Overflow that may
    lead to a write access violation.

CVE-2017-16544

    In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox, the tab
    autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames
    in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing
    any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result
    in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.

CVE-2018-1000517

    BusyBox contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in
    Busybox wget that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow.
    This attack appears to be exploitable via network connectivity.

CVE-2015-9621

    Unziping a specially crafted zip file results in a computation of an
    invalid pointer and a crash reading an invalid address.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.22.0-19+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your busybox packages.

## Details

Tyler Hicks discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled symlinks inside tar

archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted tar archive, a remote attacker could overwrite arbitrary

files outside of the current directory. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-5325](/security/CVE-2011-5325))

Mathias Krause discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled kernel module

loading restrictions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

bypass intended restrictions. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-9645](/security/CVE-2014-9645))

It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain ZIP archives. If

a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted

ZIP archive, a remote attacker could cause BusyBox to crash, leading to a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-9261](/security/CVE-2015-9261))

Nico Golde discovered that the BusyBox DHCP client incorrectly handled

certain malformed domain names. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause the DHCP client to crash, leading to a denial of service.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-2147](/security/CVE-2016-2147))

Nico Golde discovered that the BusyBox DHCP client incorrectly handled

certain 6RD options. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the

DHCP client to crash, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. ([CVE-2016-2148](/security/CVE-2016-2148))

It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain bzip2 archives.

If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially

crafted bzip2 archive, a remote attacker could cause BusyBox to crash,

leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-15873](/security/CVE-2017-15873))

It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled tab completion. A local

attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-16544](/security/CVE-2017-16544))

It was discovered that the BusyBox wget utility incorrectly handled certain

responses. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause BusyBox to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-1000517](/security/CVE-2018-1000517))

It was discovered that the BusyBox DHCP utilities incorrectly handled

certain memory operations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue

to access sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-20679](/security/CVE-2018-20679), [CVE-2019-5747](/security/CVE-2019-5747))
