Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-15873:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `get_next_block` function located in `archival/libarchive/decompress_bunzip2.c`. Specifically, a variable `runCnt` is calculated which can overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `runCnt` variable is subject to an integer overflow during the processing of a specially crafted bzip2 archive. The calculation `runCnt += (runPos << nextSym)` can result in `runCnt` exceeding its maximum value, especially when dealing with runs of 0 length.
*   **Write Access Violation:** The integer overflow in `runCnt` leads to a write access violation due to out-of-bounds access when copying data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the `bunzip2` decompression process, causing a denial of service.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources suggest the possibility of arbitrary code execution, although this is not the primary outcome mentioned. The integer overflow and subsequent write access violation could potentially be leveraged for more serious exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted bzip2 Archive:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted bzip2 archive for decompression by BusyBox. This archive contains data patterns that result in the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Crafted Input:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious bzip2 file to a system running a vulnerable version of BusyBox, and cause the system to attempt decompression using the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found through fuzzing with AFL.
*   The fix involves using an `unsigned` type for `runCnt` and adding a check if `runCnt` is greater than `dbufSize` which results in an error if true.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions 1.16.0, 1.17.2 and the git master branch at the time of reporting.
*   The issue is fixed by commit `0402cb32df015d9372578e3db27db47b33d5c7b0`.
