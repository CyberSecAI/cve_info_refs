IRSSI-SA-2017-10 Irssi Security Advisory [1]
============================================
CVE-2017-15228, CVE-2017-15227, CVE-2017-15721, CVE-2017-15723, CVE-2017-15722
Description
-----------
Multiple vulnerabilities have been located in Irssi.
(a) When installing themes with unterminated colour formatting
sequences, Irssi may access data beyond the end of the string.
(CWE-126) Found by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
CVE-2017-15228 [2] was assigned to this issue.
(b) While waiting for the channel synchronisation, Irssi may
incorrectly fail to remove destroyed channels from the query list,
resulting in use after free conditions when updating the state later
on. Found by Joseph Bisch. (CWE-416 caused by CWE-672)
CVE-2017-15227 [3] was assigned to this issue.
(c) Certain incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages could cause NULL
pointer dereference. Found by Joseph Bisch. This is a separate, but
similar issue to CVE-2017-9468. (CWE-690)
CVE-2017-15721 [4] was assigned to this issue.
(d) Overlong nicks or targets may result in a NULL pointer dereference
while splitting the message found by Joseph Bisch.
CVE-2017-15723 [5] was assigned to this issue.
(e) In certain cases Irssi may fail to verify that a Safe channel ID is
long enough, causing reads beyond the end of the string. Found by
Joseph Bisch. (CWE-126)
CVE-2017-15722 [6] was assigned to this issue.
Impact
------
(a) May result in denial of service (remote crash).
(b) May result in denial of service (remote crash).
(c) May result in denial of service (remote crash).
(d) May result in denial of service (remote crash).
(e) May affect the stability of Irssi.
Affected versions
-----------------
(a) All Irssi versions that we observed
(b) All Irssi versions that we observed
(c) All Irssi versions that we observed
(d) Irssi 0.8.17 and later
(e) All Irssi versions that we observed
Fixed in
--------
Irssi 1.0.5
Recommended action
------------------
Upgrade to Irssi 1.0.5. Irssi 1.0.5 is a maintenance release in the 1.0
series, without any new features.
After installing the updated packages, one can issue the /upgrade
command to load the new binary. TLS connections will require /reconnect.
Mitigating facts
----------------
(a) requires user to install malicious or broken theme file
(b) requires a broken ircd or control over the ircd
(c) requires a broken ircd or control over the ircd
(d) irc servers typically have length limits in place
(e) requires a broken ircd or control over the ircd

Package        : irssi

Debian Bug     : 867598 879521

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Irssi, a terminal based
IRC client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2017-10965

    Brian 'geeknik' Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi does
    not properly handle receiving messages with invalid time stamps. A
    malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi
    to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-10966

    Brian 'geeknik' Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi is
    susceptible to a use-after-free flaw triggered while updating the
    internal nick list. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-15227

    Joseph Bisch discovered that while waiting for the channel
    synchronisation, Irssi may incorrectly fail to remove destroyed
    channels from the query list, resulting in use after free conditions
    when updating the state later on. A malicious IRC server can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2017-15228

    Hanno Boeck reported that Irssi does not properly handle installing
    themes with unterminated colour formatting sequences, leading to a
    denial of service if a user is tricked into installing a specially
    crafted theme.

CVE-2017-15721

    Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly handle
    incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages. A malicious IRC server can
    take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2017-15722

    Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly verify Safe
    channel IDs. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-15723

    Joseph Bisch reported that Irssi does not properly handle overlong
    nicks or targets resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when
    splitting the message and leading to a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.17-1+deb8u5.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+deb9u3. CVE-2017-10965 and CVE-2017-10966 were already
fixed in an earlier point release.

We recommend that you upgrade your irssi packages.
