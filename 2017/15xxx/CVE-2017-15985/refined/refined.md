- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `pid` and `id` parameters within the `product_view1.php` and `productcompanyinfo.php` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database, which may allow them to access sensitive data, modify database records, or even take full control of the server. The provided exploit examples demonstrate how an attacker can potentially extract data by injecting a `UNION SELECT` statement and perform time-based blind SQL injection by using `SLEEP()`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `pid` and `id` parameters in the vulnerable PHP scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and inject malicious SQL payloads into the vulnerable parameters.
