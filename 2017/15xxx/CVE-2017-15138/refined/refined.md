```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An improper authorization flaw in the atomic-openshift component allows a user with cluster-reader project viewer permissions to trigger an application build due to having access to the webhook secret key.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper authorization",
    "Confidential information (webhook tokens) lives in a non-confidential resource."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with cluster-reader or project viewer permissions can trigger a build of an application that should be restricted.",
  "Attack vectors": "By exploiting the ability to view webhook tokens (confidential information) by users with project viewer or cluster-reader roles, unauthorized builds can be triggered.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have either 'cluster-reader' permissions or project viewer permissions within the affected OpenShift Container Platform environment."
