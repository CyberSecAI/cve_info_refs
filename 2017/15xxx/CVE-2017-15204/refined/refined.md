Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper authorization checks in Kanboard. Authenticated users were able to manipulate form data to perform actions on resources (projects, tasks, etc.) that belonged to other users, specifically private projects. The application was not validating if the user submitting the form had the necessary permissions to perform the requested action on the target resource.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application was directly using the provided IDs in the forms without proper validation of the user's permission to access the resources associated with those IDs.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application did not verify if an authenticated user had the necessary permissions to modify or access the resources (projects, tasks, categories, etc.) before performing the action requested via the altered form data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker, with a valid user account, could perform the following actions on other users' private projects without authorization:

*   Edit project details (name, description, etc.)
*   Add new tasks, categories, columns, swimlanes, tags, and automatic actions.
*   Edit existing tasks, categories, columns, swimlanes, and tags.
*   Remove columns, categories, and automatic actions.
*   See the names of tags on other user's projects.
*   Download attachments from private projects.
*   See thumbnails of pictures from private projects.
*   Remove attachments from private projects.
*   Add external and internal links to private projects.

This could lead to:

*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access and modification of sensitive project information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could disrupt a victim's workflow by altering project configurations, tasks, etc.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The vulnerability can undermine the confidentiality and integrity of user's data and, consequently, the application's trustworthiness.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user was able to perform actions that would normally require higher privileges

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Data Manipulation:** The primary attack vector was altering form data sent to the server. By changing the IDs and other parameters in the form, an attacker could trick the application into performing actions on resources they were not supposed to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed a valid user account on the Kanboard instance.
*   **Knowledge of Form Structure:** The attacker needed to have a basic understanding of the HTML form structure and how to modify its hidden parameters in order to target resources belonging to other users.
*   **Network Access:** Ability to intercept and modify the HTTP requests sent from the client-side application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes links to the commits that address the vulnerability, providing further insight into the specific code changes made to implement the necessary authorization checks.
*   The fixes involved adding checks to ensure that the user has access to the project associated with the resource being modified. This was primarily done in the BaseController class, which now contains methods like `getColumn`, `getSwimlane`, `getCategory`, `getProjectTag`, `getAction`, `getCustomFilter` that are called before processing the requested operations.
*   The commit message for commit `074f6c1` explicitly states "Avoid people to alter other project resources by changing form data".
*   The commit message for commit `3e0f14a` explicitly states "Do not expose IDs in forms".

In summary, this is a serious vulnerability allowing unauthorized access and manipulation of project data. The fixes implemented in version 1.0.47 are crucial for protecting Kanboard instances.
