{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the PyroBatchFTP client when connecting to an FTP server with an excessively long current directory string.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow",
    "Lack of proper input validation",
     "Overwrite of the Structured Exception Handler (SEH)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially hijack the execution flow of the application by overwriting the SEH, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious FTP server can send an overly long current directory string to the PyroBatchFTP client upon connection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or have access to an FTP server that the PyroBatchFTP client connects to."
