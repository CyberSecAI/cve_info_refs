# SoX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in SoX, the worst of which
may lead to a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/sox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **14.4.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **14.4.2-r1** |

### Background

SoX is a command line utility that can convert various formats of
computer audio files in to other formats.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SoX. Please review the

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/sox-14.4.2-r1"

```

Debian Bug     : 870328 878810 878809 878808 882236 882144

Various security vulnerabilities were discovered in sox, a command
line utility to convert audio formats, that may lead to a
denial-of-service (application crash / infinite loop) or memory
corruptions by processing a malformed input file.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
14.4.0-3+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.

Debian Bug     : 878809 870328

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SoX (Sound eXchange),
a sound processing program:

CVE-2017-11332

    The startread function (wav.c) is affected by a divide-by-zero
    vulnerability when processing WAV file with zero channel count. This
    flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a crafted WAV file
    to perform denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-11358

    The read_samples function (hcom.c) is affected by an invalid memory read
    vulnerability when processing HCOM files with invalid dictionnaries. This
    flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a crafted HCOM file to
    perform denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-11359

    The wavwritehdr function (wav.c) is affected by a divide-by-zero
    vulnerability when processing WAV files with invalid channel count over
    16 bits. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a crafted
    WAV file to perform denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2017-15371

    The sox_append_comment() function (formats.c) is vulnerable to a reachable
    assertion when processing FLAC files with metadata declaring more comments
    than provided. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using
    crafted FLAC data to perform denial of service (application crash).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
14.4.1-5+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.
