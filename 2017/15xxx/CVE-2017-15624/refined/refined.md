The provided content details multiple command injection vulnerabilities in TP-Link routers, specifically CVE-2017-15624 is mentioned.

**CVE-2017-15624:**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection via the `new-authtype` variable in the `pptp_server.lua` file.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `pptp_server.lua` file processes a POST request from the web management interface. The `new-authtype` argument, passed via the POST request, is not properly sanitized before being used in a command. This lack of sanitization allows for command injection.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker with administrative access to the router can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the web management interface of the router.
    *   The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the router's web interface with a malicious payload in the `new-authtype` parameter in the `pptp_server.lua` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have network connectivity to the router (either LAN or WAN if remote management is enabled).
    *   The attacker must possess valid administrator credentials for the router.
