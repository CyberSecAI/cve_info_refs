{
  "CVE-2017-15102": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the Linux kernel's `legousbtower` driver due to the device file interface not being removed upon error during the probe function call.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Race condition",
      "Write-what-where condition"
     ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to privilege escalation by remapping `dev->interrupt_out_buffer` in the `tower_write()` function, enabling arbitrary code execution or a denial of service (system crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)",
      "Physically proximate attacker"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires a forged USB device and local program execution. The malicious USB device would delay control messages in `tower_probe` and accept the control urb in `tower_open`, while user-mode code initiates a write to the device file before `tower_delete` is called due to the error in `tower_probe`."
