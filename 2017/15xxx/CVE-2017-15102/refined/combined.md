# CVE-2017-15102: Linux kernel: usb: NULL-deref due to a race condition in [legousbtower] driver

```
Heololo,

A race condition exists in Linux kernel since year 2003 through version 4.9-rc1
in [legousbtower] driver which allows a null pointer dereference caused by
not removing a device file interface on an error when the probe function is called.
This can cause a write-what-where condition by remapping dev->interrupt_out_buffer
in tower_write(), leading to privilege escalation.

usb: misc: legousbtower: Fix NULL pointer deferenceThis patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race codition in
the probe function of the legousbtower driver. It re-structures the
probe function to only register the interface after successfully reading
the board's firmware ID.
The probe function does not deregister the usb interface after an error
receiving the devices firmware ID. The device file registered
(/dev/usb/legousbtower%d) may be read/written globally before the probe
function returns. When tower\_delete is called in the probe function
(after an r/w has been initiated), core dev structures are deleted while
the file operation functions are still running. If the 0 address is
mappable on the machine, this vulnerability can be used to create a
Local Priviege Escalation exploit via a write-what-where condition by
remapping dev->interrupt\_out\_buffer in tower\_write. A forged USB device
and local program execution would be required for LPE. The USB device
would have to delay the control message in tower\_probe and accept
the control urb in tower\_open whilst guest code initiated a write to the
device file as tower\_delete is called from the error in tower\_probe.
This bug has existed since 2003. Patch tested by emulated device.

usb: misc: legousbtower: Fix NULL pointer deference

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/2fae9e5a7babada041e2e161699ade2447a01989)

```
This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race codition in
the probe function of the legousbtower driver. It re-structures the
probe function to only register the interface after successfully reading
the board's firmware ID.

The probe function does not deregister the usb interface after an error
receiving the devices firmware ID. The device file registered
(/dev/usb/legousbtower%d) may be read/written globally before the probe
function returns. When tower_delete is called in the probe function
(after an r/w has been initiated), core dev structures are deleted while
the file operation functions are still running. If the 0 address is
mappable on the machine, this vulnerability can be used to create a
Local Priviege Escalation exploit via a write-what-where condition by
remapping dev->interrupt_out_buffer in tower_write. A forged USB device
and local program execution would be required for LPE. The USB device
would have to delay the control message in tower_probe and accept
the control urb in tower_open whilst guest code initiated a write to the
device file as tower_delete is called from the error in tower_probe.

This bug has existed since 2003. Patch tested by emulated device.

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existing in the

IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2017-7542](/security/CVE-2017-7542))

Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler discovered that the memory manager in the

Linux kernel did not properly enforce the CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM protection

mechanism. A local attacker with access to /dev/mem could use this to

expose sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-7889](/security/CVE-2017-7889))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-8824](/security/CVE-2017-8824))

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

USN-3524-1 mitigated [CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754) (Meltdown) for the amd64

architecture in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the

corresponding mitigations for the ppc64el architecture. Original

advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
