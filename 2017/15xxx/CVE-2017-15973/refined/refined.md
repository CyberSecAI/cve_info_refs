Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-15973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the Sokial Social Network Script version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands through the `id` parameter in the `members_view.php` file.
*   The exploit information also specifies different types of SQL injection:
    *   boolean-based blind SQL injection
    *   error-based SQL injection
    *   stacked queries injection
    *   time-based blind SQL injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially bypass authentication or access sensitive data from the database.
*   The exploitation can lead to complete database compromise if the application is not properly secured.
*  The attacker can perform operations such as reading sensitive data, modifying database content, and potentially executing arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `members_view.php` file.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No specific position is specified, suggesting that the attacker can be remote.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides proof of concept (PoC) examples with specific SQL injection payloads.
*   The provided payloads cover various SQL injection techniques (boolean-based, error-based, time-based, and stacked queries), indicating a significant vulnerability.
*   The exploit-db entry provides an example vulnerable URL: `http://localhost/[PATH]/admin/members_view.php?id=[SQL]`
*   The vulnerability is in the `admin/members_view.php` file.
