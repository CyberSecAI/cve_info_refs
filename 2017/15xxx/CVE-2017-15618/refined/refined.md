The provided content details multiple command injection vulnerabilities affecting various TP-Link router models, including CVE-2017-15618.

**CVE-2017-15618 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `pptp_client.lua` file, specifically within the processing of the `new-enable` variable. The script fails to adequately sanitize this input, allowing for command injection.
*   **Vulnerability:** A command injection vulnerability is present in the `pptp_client.lua` file through the `new-enable` variable.
*   **Impact:** A remote, authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary commands on the router. This could lead to complete compromise of the device, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on traffic, modify router settings, or use the router as part of a botnet.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the web management interface. The attacker must first authenticate to the web management panel with valid admin credentials.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the router's web management panel as an administrator. This can be done over LAN or WAN if remote management is enabled.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-15613 to CVE-2017-15637) affecting TP-Link routers, all stemming from similar command injection issues within different Lua files.
    * The PoC provided for CVE-2017-15616 illustrates how the command injection can be triggered by modifying a variable passed in a POST request. The vulnerable parameters for other CVEs are mentioned, so the PoC can be adapted to trigger the other vulnerabilities.
    *   The issue was confirmed by the vendor and subsequently fixed.
