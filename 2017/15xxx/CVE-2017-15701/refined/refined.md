Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Qpid Broker-J not properly enforcing a maximum frame size for AMQP 1.0 frames. This lack of enforcement allows an attacker to send extremely large frames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The broker fails to check the size of incoming AMQP 1.0 frames against defined limits.
- Resource exhaustion: The vulnerability allows unbounded memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition and eventual termination of the broker service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a network connection to the Qpid Broker-J over AMQP 1.0. The attacker sends specifically crafted, oversized AMQP 1.0 frames to the broker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Qpid Broker-J instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to send AMQP 1.0 frames to the broker. No authentication is required, making it possible for unauthenticated users to exploit this.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was addressed in Qpid Broker-J version 6.1.5.
- The vulnerability only affects the AMQP 1.0 protocol, older AMQP protocols are not affected.
- Mitigation steps include disabling AMQP 1.0 support, upgrading to a fixed version of Broker-J, or excluding it from the supported protocols.
- The vulnerability is tracked in Jira as QPID-7947.
