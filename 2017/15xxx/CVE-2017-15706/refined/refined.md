Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-15706:

**CVE-2017-15706**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect documentation within Tomcat regarding the search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet. Specifically, the documentation did not accurately describe how the CGI Servlet identifies the script to execute.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a documentation error that could lead to misconfigurations or unexpected behavior. While this isn't a direct code vulnerability, it can indirectly lead to security issues if users rely on incorrect documentation for configuration purposes.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The direct impact of exploiting this flaw is not severe. Incorrect documentation can lead to misconfigurations or unexpected results. The lack of clarity in the documentation could potentially lead to an attacker being able to execute the wrong script, though the document does not elaborate further on this point.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a misconfiguration of a Tomcat server due to reliance on incorrect documentation.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have knowledge of Tomcat's configuration, the ability to exploit the discrepancy between the documentation and the actual behavior.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3665-1) indicates that this issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10.
*   The provided content does not contain information about an exploit for this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability appears to be a documentation issue, rather than a direct coding flaw.
