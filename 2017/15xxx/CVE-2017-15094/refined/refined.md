Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the DNSSEC parsing code of PowerDNS Recursor when handling specially crafted DNSSEC ECDSA keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak vulnerability in the DNSSEC parsing code.
- Specifically affects the parsing of ECDSA DNSSEC keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion from the leak.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an authoritative server sending crafted ECDSA DNSSEC keys to the PowerDNS Recursor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to be in a position to control or influence the authoritative server that sends DNSSEC responses to the vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious DNSSEC ECDSA keys.
- DNSSEC validation must be enabled on the PowerDNS Recursor (i.e., `dnssec` parameter must not be set to `off` or `process-no-validate`).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found during a code audit by Nixu.
- Affected versions are PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.6.
- PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.7 is not affected.
- A patch is available for those who cannot upgrade to a new version.
- A workaround is to disable DNSSEC validation.
