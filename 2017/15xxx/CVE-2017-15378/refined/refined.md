{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the password reset functionality where the `cpfcnpj` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability in the `cpfcnpj` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can interact directly with the database by sending SQL parameters. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification or potentially complete takeover of the system. The specific impact depends on the database privileges and the attacker's ability to construct advanced queries.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the password reset functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/esic/reset/` URL with a crafted `cpfcnpj` parameter."
