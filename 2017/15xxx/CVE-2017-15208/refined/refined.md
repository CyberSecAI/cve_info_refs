Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks and input validation in Kanboard <= 1.0.46. This allows authenticated users to manipulate form data to perform actions on resources (like projects, tasks, categories, etc.) that they don't have permissions for, specifically resources belonging to other users' private projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The application fails to verify if the logged-in user has the right to modify specific project resources before performing the requested actions. It relies solely on the presence of IDs passed in the form data.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate if the project IDs or other resource IDs passed via form data belong to the user making the request, or if the action is allowed for the specific user.
*   **Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application exposes internal IDs of resources (projects, tasks, categories, etc.) and uses these IDs directly in forms without proper authorization checks, allowing attackers to manipulate these IDs and access or modify other users' data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can:

*   Modify the name, email, identifier, and description of a private project belonging to another user.
*   Add new tasks to another user's private project.
*   Edit columns in another user's private project.
*   Add or edit categories in another user's private project.
*   Edit swimlanes in another user's private project.
*   Edit or see tags in another user's private project.
*   Add or remove automatic actions in another user's private project.
*   Remove columns or categories from another user's private project.
*   Edit tasks in another user's private project.
*    Add external or internal links to a private project of another user.
*    Download attachments, view thumbnails, or remove attachments from a private project of another user.

In short, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to, and modify or delete, data from private projects belonging to other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is manipulating form data in HTTP requests. An attacker would:

1.  Log in as a valid user.
2.  Inspect the form data for legitimate actions within the application (e.g. editing their own project or task).
3.  Modify the form data by altering the IDs of the target project or resource, replacing them with the ID of a private project they do not own/have access to or the resources within said project, belonging to another user.
4.  Submit the modified form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a registered user on the Kanboard instance (authenticated user).
*   The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of how to modify HTTP requests, specifically form data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit links show the fixes for these issues. The fixes primarily involve adding checks in the controller to verify if the user has access to the targeted resource based on the user's permissions.
* The issues are fixed in Kanboard 1.0.47.
* The attacker does not require elevated privileges but simply needs to be a registered user on the platform.
* There are multiple instances of the same vulnerability across different modules.
