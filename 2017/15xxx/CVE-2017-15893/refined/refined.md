- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Directory traversal vulnerability in the `SYNO.FileStation.Extract` component of Synology File Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the `dest_folder_path` parameter of the `SYNO.FileStation.Extract` function, which is susceptible to directory traversal attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote authenticated users can write arbitrary files to the system via the vulnerable parameter. This can lead to arbitrary file modification and potentially further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out remotely, and the attacker must be authenticated to the File Station application. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `dest_folder_path` parameter during a file extraction operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a valid user authenticated to the Synology File Station application.
