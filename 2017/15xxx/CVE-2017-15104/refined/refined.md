  "CVE-2017-15104": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "CVE_ID": "CVE-2017-15104",
      "Description": "An access flaw was found in heketi, where the heketi.json configuration file was world readable. An attacker having local access to the Heketi server could read plain-text passwords from the heketi.json file."
    },
    "Technical_Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The heketi.json configuration file was world-readable, exposing sensitive information.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Information Disclosure"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker with local access to the Heketi server could read plaintext passwords from the heketi.json configuration file.",
      "Attack Vector": "Local access to the Heketi server.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "Local access to the Heketi server as any user.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability was present because the heketi.json configuration file had insecure permissions, making it world-readable. This allowed any local user to access the file and view its contents, including sensitive information such as passwords stored in plain text. There was no need for special privileges to exploit this issue."

   "CVE-2017-15103": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "CVE_ID": "CVE-2017-15103",
      "Description": "A security-check flaw was found in the way the Heketi server API handled user requests. An authenticated Heketi user could send specially crafted requests to the Heketi server, resulting in remote command execution as the user running Heketi server and possibly privilege escalation."
    },
     "Technical_Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Improper handling of user requests by the Heketi server API.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "OS Command Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "An authenticated Heketi user could execute arbitrary commands on the Heketi server with the privileges of the user running the Heketi server. This could also lead to privilege escalation.",
        "Attack Vector":"Specially crafted requests to the Heketi server API by an authenticated user.",
        "Attacker Capabilities": "An authenticated Heketi user."
        , "Additional Details": "The vulnerability was caused by insufficient input validation in the Heketi server API. This allowed authenticated users to inject malicious code into their requests, which would then be executed by the server, essentially allowing command execution. This command injection vulnerability could potentially lead to privilege escalation if the Heketi server was running with higher privileges."
