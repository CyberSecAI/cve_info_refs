Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability in SoftDatepro Dating Social Network 1.3

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `profid` parameter in `viewprofile.php` and the `sender_id` parameter in `viewmessage.php`.
- The admin login is vulnerable through email input using `'or 1=1 or ''='`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database.
- This could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially gaining complete control over the application and its database.
- The attacker can also bypass the admin login.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `viewprofile.php` and `viewmessage.php` by manipulating the `profid` and `sender_id` parameters respectively.
- Additionally, the admin login is vulnerable to SQL injection through the email field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in `viewprofile.php` and `viewmessage.php`. The admin login bypass does require the attacker to be able to access the admin login page.
