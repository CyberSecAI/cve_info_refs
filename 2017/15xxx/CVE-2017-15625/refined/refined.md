{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the lua files. Specifically, the 'new-olmode' variable in the pptp_client.lua file is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected TP-Link router. This could lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to control the device, steal sensitive information, or use it as part of a botnet. The provided PoC shows how to enable telnetd on the router.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP POST requests to the web management panel. An attacker can manipulate the 'new-olmode' parameter within the POST request data to inject commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated administrator to exploit the vulnerability. This means the attacker needs to have valid credentials for the web management panel of the TP-Link router. The attack can be launched from the LAN or WAN if remote management is enabled."
