The provided content details multiple command injection vulnerabilities in TP-Link routers, specifically CVE-2017-15630, which is one of them.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2017-15630, and the other listed vulnerabilities, is insufficient input validation in the Lua scripts used by the TP-Link routers' web management interface. Specifically, user-supplied input is directly inserted into system commands without sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:**  The `new-remotesubnet` variable within the `pptp_client.lua` file is vulnerable to command injection. This variable is passed to a system command without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
- **Full Router Control:** This can lead to complete control of the router, including the ability to modify configurations, intercept traffic, establish backdoors, and potentially use the compromised device as a foothold for further attacks on the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Management Interface:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through HTTP POST requests to the router's web management interface (e.g., `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/admin/phddns?form=phddns`).
- **Specific Parameters:** The attack uses specific parameters in the POST request that are not properly sanitized, such as `new-remotesubnet`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials for the router's web interface.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router, either from the local network (LAN) or potentially from the internet if remote management is enabled on the router.
