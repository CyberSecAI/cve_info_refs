Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15656:

**1. Verification:**

The provided text directly mentions "CVE: CVE-2017-15656" and describes a vulnerability related to "Password stored in plain text" in ASUS routers. This aligns with the description of CVE-2017-15656 which involves storing passwords in plaintext within NVRAM memory.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - Passwords for the router's administrator account are stored in plaintext in the NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory) of the device.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Plaintext storage of sensitive data (passwords).

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the router's shell (e.g., via telnet) can execute `nvram show` and read the administrator's password in plaintext.
   - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download a backup file of the router's configuration, decode it, and extract the administrator's password.
   - **Full Router Control:** With the plaintext password, an attacker gains full administrative access to the router, potentially leading to further malicious activities.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Local Access:** Direct access to the router's shell (e.g., via telnet or SSH) allows an attacker to execute the `nvram show` command.
   - **Remote Access (Indirect):** If the attacker can gain access to the router’s backup file (e.g., through other vulnerabilities, or if the backup file is exposed), they can then obtain the plaintext password.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the router's shell (e.g., through a vulnerability that provides telnet access).
   - Alternatively, the attacker needs access to the backup file of the router’s configuration.
   - The attacker also needs the ability to decode the backup file if they are obtaining it through that vector.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 17.09.2017.
*   The vendor stated on 03.01.2018 that NVRAM would be encrypted in February of that year.
