Subject: Several Privilege Escalation issues in Kanboard <= 1.0.46

Hi,

I've discovered several security issues in Kanboard <= 1.0.46
(<https://kanboard.net>)

1)
By altering form data an authenticated user can edit Name, Email,
Identifier, Description,... of a private project of another user.

2)
By altering form data an authenticated user can add a new task to a
private project of another user.

3)
By altering form data an authenticated user can edit columns of a
private project of another user.

4)
By altering form data an authenticated user can add a new category to a
private project of another user.

5)
By altering form data an authenticated user can edit a category of a
private project of another user.

6)
By altering form data an authenticated user can edit swimlanes of a
private project of another user.

7)
By altering form data an authenticated user can edit tags of a private
project of another user.

8)
By altering form data an authenticated user can add automatic actions to
a private project of another user.

9)
By altering form data an authenticated user can remove columns from a
private project of another user.

10)
By altering form data an authenticated user can remove categories from a
private project of another user.

11)
By altering form data an authenticated user can at least see the name of
tags of a private project of another user.

12)
By altering form data an authenticated user can remove automatic actions
from a private project of another user.

13)
By altering form data an authenticated user can edit tasks of a private
project of another user.

14)
By altering form data an authenticated user can add a external link to a
private project of another user.

15)
By altering form data an authenticated user can add a internal link to a
private project of another user.

16)
By altering form data an authenticated user can download attachments
from a private project of another user.

17)
By altering form data an authenticated user can see thumbnails of
pictures from a private project of another user.

18)
By altering form data an authenticated user can remove attachments from

Fix:
<https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/7100f6de8a1f566e260b3e65312767e4cde112b1>

The issues are fixed in Kanboard 1.0.47.
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control checks when processing form data. The application did not properly validate if the authenticated user had the right privileges to perform an action on the specified project.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Privilege Escalation**: Authenticated users could perform actions on private projects of other users by manipulating form data.
    - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: The application used direct object references (project/task/category IDs) in form data without proper authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker could modify or delete data belonging to other users' private projects. This could range from simple edits to complete data loss or manipulation, including adding tasks, modifying project parameters, etc.
    - An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to private project data.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - By altering form data submitted by an authenticated user, an attacker can inject project, task, or other IDs of private projects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Kanboard application.
    - The attacker must be able to manipulate form data submitted to the application.
```
The provided content describes multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Kanboard <= 1.0.46. By altering form data, an authenticated user can perform unauthorized actions on private projects of other users. This includes editing project details, adding tasks, modifying columns, categories, swimlanes, tags, actions, and also viewing/downloading/removing attachments. The issues are resolved in version 1.0.47 through specific commits on GitHub.
