The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in PRTG Network Manager, and it explicitly mentions CVE-2017-15360.

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when storing sensor titles.
  - **Weaknesses:** The `<title>` parameter is not directly vulnerable, but the tooltip which displays sensor information interprets the stored payload leading to execution of malicious javascript.
  - **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session when the user hovers over a sensor with a crafted title. This can lead to session hijacking via cookie theft.
  - **Attack Vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated and have write permissions within the PRTG application to modify sensor titles.
    - The attacker injects HTML encoded IMG tag with a null byte as the source which forces an error. The error handler then executes the attacker's javascript.
  - **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Authenticated user with write permissions to modify sensor titles.

**Additional Details:**
*   The article provides more detail than a standard CVE description by describing the exact parameters, injection method and payload used to trigger the vulnerability, including the use of  `&#x3C;img/src=&#x60;%00&#x60; onerror=this.onerror=alert(document.cookie)`.

The article also mentions other vulnerabilities, including reflected XSS (CVE-2017-15009), another stored XSS in groups, arbitrary file upload (CVE-2017-15651, CVE-2017-15917), and an access control flaw (CVE-2017-15008).
