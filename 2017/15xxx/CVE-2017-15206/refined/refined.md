Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Kanboard <= 1.0.46:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks in the application's controllers. Authenticated users were able to modify form data to target resources belonging to other users' private projects. The application failed to verify that the user performing the action had the appropriate permissions to access and modify the targeted resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application was using predictable IDs (e.g., project IDs, task IDs, subtask IDs) in form data without proper authorization checks. An attacker could modify these IDs to access and manipulate resources they should not have access to.
*   **Missing Authorization:**  The application lacked sufficient checks to confirm whether a user had the necessary permissions to perform actions on specific resources, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **CSRF protection bypass:** While CSRF protection exists, it is not mentioned as a problem in the vulnerability description. However the fixes include adding checks for task/project ownership in some controller methods, indicating a lack of proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could:

*   **Modify Project Settings:** Change the name, description, or other settings of private projects belonging to other users.
*   **Manipulate Tasks:** Add, edit, or delete tasks within other users' private projects.
*   **Modify Project Structure:** Add, edit, or remove columns, categories, swimlanes, and tags of other users' private projects.
*   **Manipulate Automatic Actions:** Add or remove automatic actions associated with other users' private projects.
*   **View Sensitive Information:** At least view the names of tags of a private project of another user.
*   **Access Attachments:** Download and view attachments from other users' private projects.
*   **Manipulate Links:** Add external or internal links to a private project of another user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Altering Form Data:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating HTTP POST requests. An attacker can intercept form data, modify resource IDs (e.g., `project_id`, `task_id`, `subtask_id`, etc.), and submit the modified data to the server. The server-side application, lacking proper authorization checks, processes the request, leading to unauthorized access or modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Kanboard instance.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker must have some knowledge of the application's internal structure and how form data is used, to identify the IDs to change.
*   **Ability to Intercept/Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP POST requests, often through the browser's developer tools or using a proxy.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was resolved in Kanboard version 1.0.47
*   The fix involved adding proper authorization checks in several controllers, specifically checking if the user has the required permissions to perform actions on the targeted resources, and ensuring correct project ownership.
*   The commit logs show fixes in BaseController and several other controllers, such as `ActionController`, `CategoryController`, `ColumnController`, `CustomFilterController`, `ProjectEditController`, `ProjectTagController`, `SwimlaneController`, `TaskCreationController`, `CommentController`, `SubtaskController`, `SubtaskConverterController`, `SubtaskRestrictionController`, `SubtaskStatusController`, and `TaskExternalLinkController`, confirming the broad scope of the vulnerability.
