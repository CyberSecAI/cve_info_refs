{
  "CVE-2017-15804": {
    "Description": "The glob function in glob.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.27 contains a buffer overflow during unescaping of user names with the ~ operator.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow occurs during the unescaping of usernames with the ~ operator in the glob function. The function improperly handles the expansion of tilde (~) characters in user names, which leads to a buffer overflow when the unescaped username exceeds the allocated buffer's capacity.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the `glob()` function when processing user names containing tilde (~) characters.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to provide crafted input that includes a tilde (~) followed by a sequence of characters that, upon unescaping, would exceed the buffer's limit."
