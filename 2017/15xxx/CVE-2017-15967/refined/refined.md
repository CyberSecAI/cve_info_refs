Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15967:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in Mailing List Manager Pro 3.0. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected through the `edit` parameter in URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The impact of successful exploitation is significant, allowing an attacker to:
    - Gain access to the database.
    - Potentially modify or delete sensitive data,
    - Access user credentials,
    - Potentially gain control of the application server,
    - Execute arbitrary code on the server, if database access is not properly secured.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through HTTP requests. Specifically, the vulnerable parameters are within the query string.
  - `http://localhost/[PATH]/admin/users/?sort=login&edit=[SQL]`
  - `http://localhost/[PATH]/admin/template/?edit=[SQL]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They must have knowledge of vulnerable URL parameters and the format of the SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability. No authentication to the application may be required initially to trigger this vulnerability, or it may be exploitable with low-privileged access, although the description does not specify.

**Summary of Exploit:**

The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code via the `edit` parameter. The example payload uses `UNION SELECT` to extract database information such as `USER()`, `DATABASE()`, and `VERSION()`. The attacker can potentially use this injection point to carry out further attacks.

**Additional Information:**

* The exploit was tested on Windows 7 x64 and Kali Linux x64.
