```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a design flaw where the OpenText Documentum Content Server does not properly restrict the creation of dmr_content objects, which allows any authenticated user to create dmr_content objects pointing to arbitrary content files already present on the Content Server filesystem.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure object creation",
    "Lack of access control"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user can download arbitrary content files from the Content Server filesystem, regardless of their repository permissions. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based and involves exploiting the START_PUSH, file upload, and END_PUSH_V2 RPC commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenText Documentum Content Server."
