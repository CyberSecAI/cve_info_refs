{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The PostgreSQL initialization scripts had privilege escalation flaws. The scripts used file names that the database superuser could replace with symbolic links. As root, the scripts would then open(), chmod(), and/or chown() these files, allowing a database superuser to escalate to root privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition vulnerabilities in Red Hat initialization and setup scripts for postgresql.",
       "Insecure file handling in init scripts"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the postgres user account could use these flaws to obtain root access on the server machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system with 'postgres' user privileges is required to create symbolic links to root owned files",
       "Exploiting a race condition during the initialization of the database."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Access to the 'postgres' user account.  Ability to create symbolic links."
