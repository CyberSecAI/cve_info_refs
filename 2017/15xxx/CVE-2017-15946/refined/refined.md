- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `com_tag` component in Joomla is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `tag` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability in the `tag` parameter of the `com_tag` Joomla component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to web application or database management system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file with a crafted `tag` parameter. The attack is client-side and requires no user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request to a vulnerable Joomla installation and does not need any privileged user account or user interaction.
