  "CVE-2017-15649": {
    "description": "It was found that fanout_add() in 'net/packet/af_packet.c' in the Linux kernel, before version 4.13.6, allows local users to gain privileges via crafted system calls that trigger mishandling of packet_fanout data structures, because of a race condition (involving fanout_add and packet_do_bind) that leads to a use-after-free bug.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition in the packet fanout implementation within the Linux kernel allows for inconsistent data between the test of the fanout flag and taking the lock, which could lead to type or device inconsistencies within the fanout group.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race Condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Crafted system calls triggering the race condition"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability.",
