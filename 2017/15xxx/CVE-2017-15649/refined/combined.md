packet: in packet\_do\_bind, test fanout with bind\_lock held

```
Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
across sockets in the group.

If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
with that of the fanout group.

Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.

I had to introduce artificial delay (local_bh_enable) to actually
observe the race.

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Daniel Jiang discovered that a race condition existed in the ipv4 ping

socket implementation in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-2671](/security/CVE-2017-2671))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

base: arch\_topology: fix section mismatch build warnings
commit 452562abb5b76c14449dead2a7113f641893e8bc upstream.
Commit 2ef7a2953c81 ("arm, arm64: factorize common cpu capacity default code")
introduced init\_cpu\_capacity\_callback and init\_cpu\_capacity\_notifier
which are referenced from initcall and are missing \_\_init{,data}
annotations resulting the below section mismatch build warnings.
"WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0xbab790): Section mismatch in reference from
the function init\_cpu\_capacity\_callback() to the variable .init.text:$x
The function init\_cpu\_capacity\_callback() references the variable
\_\_init $x. This is often because init\_cpu\_capacity\_callback lacks a
\_\_init annotation or the annotation of $x is wrong."
This patch fixes the above build warnings by adding the required annotations.

udp: fix bcast packet reception
commit 996b44fcef8f216ea0b6b6e74468c5a77b5e341f upstream.
The commit bc044e8db796 ("udp: perform source validation for
mcast early demux") does not take into account that broadcast packets
lands in the same code path and they need different checks for the
source address - notably, zero source address are valid for bcast
and invalid for mcast.
As a result, 2nd and later broadcast packets with 0 source address
landing to the same socket are dropped. This breaks dhcp servers.
Since we don't have stringent performance requirements for ingress
broadcast traffic, fix it by disabling UDP early demux such traffic.

udp: perform source validation for mcast early demux
[ Upstream commit bc044e8db7962e727a75b591b9851ff2ac5cf846 ]
The UDP early demux can leverate the rx dst cache even for
multicast unconnected sockets.
In such scenario the ipv4 source address is validated only on
the first packet in the given flow. After that, when we fetch
the dst entry from the socket rx cache, we stop enforcing
the rp\_filter and we even start accepting any kind of martian
addresses.
Disabling the dst cache for unconnected multicast socket will
cause large performace regression, nearly reducing by half the
max ingress tput.
Instead we factor out a route helper to completely validate an
skb source address for multicast packets and we call it from
the UDP early demux for mcast packets landing on unconnected
sockets, after successful fetching the related cached dst entry.
This still gives a measurable, but limited performance
regression:
rp\_filter = 0 rp\_filter = 1
edmux disabled: 1182 Kpps 1127 Kpps
edmux before: 2238 Kpps 2238 Kpps
edmux after: 2037 Kpps 2019 Kpps
The above figures are on top of current net tree.
Applying the net-next commit 6e617de84e87 ("net: avoid a full
fib lookup when rp\_filter is disabled.") the delta with
rp\_filter == 0 will decrease even more.

clk: samsung: exynos4: Enable VPLL and EPLL clocks for suspend/resume cycle
commit 5dcbeca615ef12047a5f4097b91030cbf995b1d2 upstream.
Commit 6edfa11cb396 ("clk: samsung: Add enable/disable operation for
PLL36XX clocks") added enable/disable operations to PLL clocks. Prior that
VPLL and EPPL clocks were always enabled because the enable bit was never
touched. Those clocks have to be enabled during suspend/resume cycle,
because otherwise board fails to enter sleep mode. This patch enables them
unconditionally before entering system suspend state. System restore
function will set them to the previous state saved in the register cache
done before that unconditional enable.

commit ad670233c9e1d5feb365d870e30083ef1b889177 upstream.
Define a policy for packet pattern attributes in order to fix a
potential read over the end of the buffer during nla\_get\_u32()
of the NL80211\_PKTPAT\_OFFSET attribute.
Note that the data there can always be read due to SKB allocation
(with alignment and struct skb\_shared\_info at the end), but the
data might be uninitialized. This could be used to leak some data
from uninitialized vmalloc() memory, but most drivers don't allow
an offset (so you'd just get -EINVAL if the data is non-zero) or
just allow it with a fixed value - 100 or 128 bytes, so anything
above that would get -EINVAL. With brcmfmac the limit is 1500 so
(at least) one byte could be obtained.

nvme-pci: Use PCI bus address for data/queues in CMB
commit 8969f1f8291762c13147c1ba89d46238af01675b upstream.
Currently, NVMe PCI host driver is programming CMB dma address as
I/O SQs addresses. This results in failures on systems where 1:1
outbound mapping is not used (example Broadcom iProc SOCs) because
CMB BAR will be progammed with PCI bus address but NVMe PCI EP will
try to access CMB using dma address.
To have CMB working on systems without 1:1 outbound mapping, we
program PCI bus address for I/O SQs instead of dma address. This
approach will work on systems with/without 1:1 outbound mapping.
Based on a report and previous patch from Abhishek Shah.

bsg-lib: fix use-after-free under memory-pressure
commit eab40cf336065e8d765e006b81ff48c5c114b365 upstream.
When under memory-pressure it is possible that the mempool which backs
the 'struct request\_queue' will make use of up to BLKDEV\_MIN\_RQ count
emergency buffers - in case it can't get a regular allocation. These
buffers are preallocated and once they are also used, they are
re-supplied with old finished requests from the same request\_queue (see
mempool\_free()).
The bug is, when re-supplying the emergency pool, the old requests are
not again ran through the callback mempool\_t->alloc(), and thus also not
through the callback bsg\_init\_rq(). Thus we skip initialization, and
while the sense-buffer still should be good, scsi\_request->cmd might
have become to be an invalid pointer in the meantime. When the request
is initialized in bsg.c, and the user's CDB is larger than BLK\_MAX\_CDB,
bsg will replace it with a custom allocated buffer, which is freed when
the user's command is finished, thus it dangles afterwards. When next a
command is sent by the user that has a smaller/similar CDB as
BLK\_MAX\_CDB, bsg will assume that scsi\_request->cmd is backed by
scsi\_request->\_\_cmd, will not make a custom allocation, and write into
undefined memory.
Fix this by splitting bsg\_init\_rq() into two functions:
- bsg\_init\_rq() is changed to only do the allocation of the
sense-buffer, which is used to back the bsg job's reply buffer. This
pointer should never change during the lifetime of a scsi\_request, so
it doesn't need re-initialization.
- bsg\_initialize\_rq() is a new function that makes use of
'struct request\_queue's initialize\_rq\_fn callback (which was
introduced in v4.12). This is always called before the request is
given out via blk\_get\_request(). This function does the remaining
initialization that was previously done in bsg\_init\_rq(), and will
also do it when the request is taken from the emergency-pool of the
backing mempool.

drm/i915: always update ELD connector type after get modes
commit 2d8f63297b9f0b430c96329893667c0bfdcbd47e upstream.
drm\_edid\_to\_eld() initializes the connector ELD to zero, overwriting the
ELD connector type initialized in intel\_audio\_codec\_enable(). If
userspace does getconnector and thus get\_modes after modeset, a
subsequent audio component i915\_audio\_component\_get\_eld() call will
receive an ELD without the connector type properly set. It's fine for
HDMI, but screws up audio for DP.
Always set the ELD connector type at intel\_connector\_update\_modes()
based on the connector type. We can drop the connector type update from
intel\_audio\_codec\_enable().

"A MAXIMUM WRITE SAME LENGTH field set to a non-zero value indicates

kvm/x86: Avoid async PF preempting the kernel incorrectly
commit a2b7861bb33b2538420bb5d8554153484d3f961f upstream.
Currently, in PREEMPT\_COUNT=n kernel, kvm\_async\_pf\_task\_wait() could call
schedule() to reschedule in some cases. This could result in
accidentally ending the current RCU read-side critical section early,
causing random memory corruption in the guest, or otherwise preempting
the currently running task inside between preempt\_disable and
preempt\_enable.
The difficulty to handle this well is because we don't know whether an
async PF delivered in a preemptible section or RCU read-side critical section
for PREEMPT\_COUNT=n, since preempt\_disable()/enable() and rcu\_read\_lock/unlock()
are both no-ops in that case.
To cure this, we treat any async PF interrupting a kernel context as one
that cannot be preempted, preventing kvm\_async\_pf\_task\_wait() from choosing
the schedule() path in that case.
To do so, a second parameter for kvm\_async\_pf\_task\_wait() is introduced,
so that we know whether it's called from a context interrupting the
kernel, and the parameter is set properly in all the callsites.

KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix server always zero from kvmppc\_xive\_get\_xive()
commit 2fb1e946450a4fef74bb72f360555f7760d816f0 upstream.
In KVM's XICS-on-XIVE emulation, kvmppc\_xive\_get\_xive() returns the
value of state->guest\_server as "server". However, this value is not
set by it's counterpart kvmppc\_xive\_set\_xive(). When the guest uses
this interface to migrate interrupts away from a CPU that is going
offline, it sees all interrupts as belonging to CPU 0, so they are
left assigned to (now) offline CPUs.
This patch removes the guest\_server field from the state, and returns
act\_server in it's place (that is, the CPU actually handling the
interrupt, which may differ from the one requested).

dm ioctl: fix alignment of event number in the device list
commit 62e082430ea4bb5b28909ca4375bb683931e22aa upstream.
The size of struct dm\_name\_list is different on 32-bit and 64-bit
kernels (so "(nl + 1)" differs between 32-bit and 64-bit kernels).
This mismatch caused some harmless difference in padding when using 32-bit
or 64-bit kernel. Commit 23d70c5e52dd ("dm ioctl: report event number in
DM\_LIST\_DEVICES") added reporting event number in the output of
DM\_LIST\_DEVICES\_CMD. This difference in padding makes it impossible for
userspace to determine the location of the event number (the location
would be different when running on 32-bit and 64-bit kernels).
Fix the padding by using offsetof(struct dm\_name\_list, name) instead of
sizeof(struct dm\_name\_list) to determine the location of entries.
Also, the ioctl version number is incremented to 37 so that userspace
can use the version number to determine that the event number is present
and correctly located.
In addition, a global event is now raised when a DM device is created,
removed, renamed or when table is swapped, so that the user can monitor
for device changes.

netlink: fix nla\_put\_{u8,u16,u32} for KASAN
commit b4391db42308c9940944b5d7be5ca4b78fb88dd0 upstream.
When CONFIG\_KASAN is enabled, the "--param asan-stack=1" causes rather large
stack frames in some functions. This goes unnoticed normally because
CONFIG\_FRAME\_WARN is disabled with CONFIG\_KASAN by default as of commit
3f181b4d8652 ("lib/Kconfig.debug: disable -Wframe-larger-than warnings with
KASAN=y").
The kernelci.org build bot however has the warning enabled and that led
me to investigate it a little further, as every build produces these warnings:
net/wireless/nl80211.c:4389:1: warning: the frame size of 2240 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

net/bridge/br\_netlink.c:1282:1: warning: the frame size of 2544 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
Most of this problem is now solved in gcc-8, which can consolidate
the stack slots for the inline function arguments. On older compilers
we can add a workaround by declaring a local variable in each function
to pass the inline function argument.

HID: wacom: Always increment hdev refcount within wacom\_get\_hdev\_data
commit 2a5e597c6bb1b873e473e5f57147e9e5d2755430 upstream.
The wacom\_get\_hdev\_data function is used to find and return a reference to
the "other half" of a Wacom device (i.e., the touch device associated with
a pen, or vice-versa). To ensure these references are properly accounted
for, the function is supposed to automatically increment the refcount before
returning. This was not done, however, for devices which have pen & touch
on different interfaces of the same USB device. This can lead to a WARNING
("refcount\_t: underflow; use-after-free") when removing the module or device
as we call kref\_put() more times than kref\_get(). Triggering an "actual" use-
after-free would be difficult since both devices will disappear nearly-
simultaneously. To silence this warning and prevent the potential error, we
need to increment the refcount for all cases within wacom\_get\_hdev\_data.

HID: wacom: generic: Clear ABS\_MISC when tool leaves proximity
commit 92380b572d95caf48f8424746aeee63c5a2b1922 upstream.
The tool ID information sent in ABS\_MISC is expected to be reset to 0
when a tool leaves proximity. Not doing this can cause problems if a
tool is removed and then re-introduced. Kernel event filtering will
prevent the (identical) ABS\_MISC event from being sent when the tool
re-enters proxmity. This can cause userspace to not properly set the
tool ID.

HID: wacom: generic: Send MSC\_SERIAL and ABS\_MISC when leaving prox
commit 993f0d93f8538c15bd5c12a1a9fd74c777efea1b upstream.
The latest generation of pro devices (MobileStudio Pro, 2nd-gen Intuos
Pro, Cintiq Pro) send a serial number of '0' whenever the pen is too far
away for reliable communication. Userspace defines that a serial number
of '0' is invalid, so we need to be careful not to actually forward
this value. Additionally, since EMR ISDv4 devices do not support serial
numbers or tool IDs, we'd like to not send these events if they aren't
necessary.
The existing code achieves these goals by adding a check for a non-zero
serial number within the wacom\_wac\_pen\_report function. The MSC\_SERIAL
and ABS\_MISC events are only sent if the serial number is non-zero. This
code fails, however when the pen for a pro device leaves proximity. When
the pen leaves prox and the tablet sends a serial of 0, wacom\_wac\_pen\_event
dutifully clears the serial number. When wacom\_wac\_pen\_report is called,
it does not send either the MSC\_SERIAL of the exiting tool nor an ABS\_MISC
event.
This patch prevents the wacom\_wac\_pen\_event function from clearing an
already-set serial number. This ensures that we have the serial number
handy when exiting proximity, but requires us to manually clear it
afterwards to ensure the driver does not send stale data (e.g. when
switching between AES pens that report a serial nubmer of 0 for the
first few fully in-proximity packets).

HID: wacom: Correct coordinate system of touchring and pen twist
commit d252f4a10fb9c8f7187c6c936ff530039f8cb799 upstream.
The MobileStudio Pro, Cintiq Pro, and 2nd-gen Intuos Pro devices use a
different coordinate system for their touchring and pen twist than prior
devices. Prior devices had zero aligned to the tablet's left and would
increase clockwise. Userspace expects data from the kernel to be in this
old coordinate space, so adjustments are necessary.
While the coordinate system for pen twist is formally defined by the HID
standard, no such definition existed for the touchring at the time these
tablets were introduced. Future tablets are expected to report touchring
data using the same "zero-up clockwise-increasing" coordinate system
defined for twist.

The wacom driver's IRQ handler for Bluetooth reports from the 2nd-gen

tilt and rotation (which can go negative) are instead interpreted as
unsigned and so jump to very large values when the data should be
negative. This commit properly casts the data to ensure we report

HID: rmi: Make sure the HID device is opened on resume
commit cac72b990d34f4c70208998a86f910ba38253c94 upstream.
So it looks like that suspend/resume has actually always been broken on
hid-rmi. The fact it worked was a rather silly coincidence that was
relying on the HID device to already be opened upon resume. This means
that so long as anything was reading the /dev/input/eventX node for for
an RMI device, it would suspend and resume correctly. As well, if
nothing happened to be keeping the HID device away it would shut off,
then the RMI driver would get confused on resume when it stopped
responding and explode.
So, call hid\_hw\_open() in rmi\_post\_resume() so we make sure that the
device is alive before we try talking to it.
This fixes RMI device suspend/resume over HID.

ovl: fix regression caused by exclusive upper/work dir protection
commit 85fdee1eef1a9e48ad5716916677e0c5fbc781e3 upstream.
Enforcing exclusive ownership on upper/work dirs caused a docker
regression: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34672.
Euan spotted the regression and pointed to the offending commit.
Vivek has brought the regression to my attention and provided this
reproducer:
Terminal 1:
mount -t overlay -o workdir=work,lowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper none
merged/
Terminal 2:
unshare -m
Terminal 1:
umount merged
mount -t overlay -o workdir=work,lowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper none
merged/
mount: /root/overlay-testing/merged: none already mounted or mount point
busy
To fix the regression, I replaced the error with an alarming warning.
With index feature enabled, mount does fail, but logs a suggestion to
override exclusive dir protection by disabling index.
Note that index=off mount does take the inuse locks, so a concurrent
index=off will issue the warning and a concurrent index=on mount will fail.
Documentation was updated to reflect this change.

The trampoline allocated by function tracer was overwriten by function\_graph
tracer, and caused a memory leak. The save\_global\_trampoline should have
saved the previous trampoline in register\_ftrace\_graph() and restored it in
unregister\_ftrace\_graph(). But as it is implemented, save\_global\_trampoline was
only used in unregister\_ftrace\_graph as default value 0, and it overwrote the
previous trampoline's value. Causing the previous allocated trampoline to be
lost.

stm class: Fix a use-after-free
commit fd085bb1766d6a598f53af2308374a546a49775a upstream.
For reasons unknown, the stm\_source removal path uses device\_destroy()
to kill the underlying device object. Because device\_destroy() uses
devt to look for the device to destroy and the fact that stm\_source
devices don't have one (or all have the same one), it just picks the
first device in the class, which may well be the wrong one.
That is, loading stm\_console and stm\_heartbeat and then removing both
will die in dereferencing a freed object.
Since this should have been device\_unregister() in the first place,
use it instead of device\_destroy().

Drivers: hv: fcopy: restore correct transfer length
commit 549e658a0919e355a2b2144dc380b3729bef7f3e upstream.
Till recently the expected length of bytes read by the
daemon did depend on the context. It was either hv\_start\_fcopy or
hv\_do\_fcopy. The daemon had a buffer size of two pages, which was much
larger than needed.
Now the expected length of bytes read by the
daemon changed slightly. For START\_FILE\_COPY it is still the size of
hv\_start\_fcopy. But for WRITE\_TO\_FILE and the other operations it is as
large as the buffer that arrived via vmbus. In case of WRITE\_TO\_FILE
that is slightly larger than a struct hv\_do\_fcopy. Since the buffer in
the daemon was still larger everything was fine.
Currently, the daemon reads only what is actually needed.
The new buffer layout is as large as a struct hv\_do\_fcopy, for the
WRITE\_TO\_FILE operation. Since the kernel expects a slightly larger
size, hvt\_op\_read will return -EINVAL because the daemon will read
slightly less than expected. Address this by restoring the expected
buffer size in case of WRITE\_TO\_FILE.

cgroup: Reinit cgroup\_taskset structure before cgroup\_migrate\_execute() returns
commit c4fa6c43ce4b427350cfbb659436bfe3d9e09a1d upstream.
The cgroup\_taskset structure within the larger cgroup\_mgctx structure
is supposed to be used once and then discarded. That is not really the
case in the hotplug code path:
cpuset\_hotplug\_workfn()
- cgroup\_transfer\_tasks()
- cgroup\_migrate()
- cgroup\_migrate\_add\_task()
- cgroup\_migrate\_execute()
In this case, the cgroup\_migrate() function is called multiple time
with the same cgroup\_mgctx structure to transfer the tasks from
one cgroup to another one-by-one. The second time cgroup\_migrate()
is called, the cgroup\_taskset will be in an incorrect state and so
may cause the system to panic. For example,

To allow reuse of the cgroup\_mgctx structure, some fields in that
structure are now re-initialized at the end of cgroup\_migrate\_execute()
function call so that the structure can be reused again in a later

This bug was introduced in the commit e595cd706982 ("group: track

cgroup\_taskset initialization out of cgroup\_migrate(). The commit

driver core: platform: Don't read past the end of "driver\_override" buffer
commit bf563b01c2895a4bfd1a29cc5abc67fe706ecffd upstream.
When printing the driver\_override parameter when it is 4095 and 4094 bytes
long, the printing code would access invalid memory because we need count+1
bytes for printing.
Reject driver\_override values of these lengths in driver\_override\_store().
This is in close analogy to commit 4efe874aace5 ("PCI: Don't read past the
end of sysfs "driver\_override" buffer") from Sasha Levin.

percpu: make this\_cpu\_generic\_read() atomic w.r.t. interrupts
commit e88d62cd4b2f0b1ae55e9008e79c2794b1fc914d upstream.
As raw\_cpu\_generic\_read() is a plain read from a raw\_cpu\_ptr() address,
it's possible (albeit unlikely) that the compiler will split the access
across multiple instructions.
In this\_cpu\_generic\_read() we disable preemption but not interrupts
before calling raw\_cpu\_generic\_read(). Thus, an interrupt could be taken
in the middle of the split load instructions. If a this\_cpu\_write() or
RMW this\_cpu\_\*() op is made to the same variable in the interrupt
handling path, this\_cpu\_read() will return a torn value.
For native word types, we can avoid tearing using READ\_ONCE(), but this
won't work in all cases (e.g. 64-bit types on most 32-bit platforms).
This patch reworks this\_cpu\_generic\_read() to use READ\_ONCE() where
possible, otherwise falling back to disabling interrupts.

powerpc/tm: Fix illegal TM state in signal handler
commit 044215d145a7a8a60ffa8fdc859d110a795fa6ea upstream.
Currently it's possible that on returning from the signal handler
through the restore\_tm\_sigcontexts() code path (e.g. from a signal
caught due to a `trap` instruction executed in the middle of an HTM
block, or a deliberately constructed sigframe) an illegal TM state
(like TS=10 TM=0, i.e. "T0") is set in SRR1 and when `rfid` sets
implicitly the MSR register from SRR1 register on return to userspace
it causes a TM Bad Thing exception.
That illegal state can be set (a) by a malicious user that disables
the TM bit by tweaking the bits in uc\_mcontext before returning from
the signal handler or (b) by a sufficient number of context switches
occurring such that the load\_tm counter overflows and TM is disabled
whilst in the signal handler.
This commit fixes the illegal TM state by ensuring that TM bit is
always enabled before we return from restore\_tm\_sigcontexts(). A small
comment correction is made as well.

powerpc/64s: Use emergency stack for kernel TM Bad Thing program checks
commit 265e60a170d0a0ecfc2d20490134ed2c48dd45ab upstream.
When using transactional memory (TM), the CPU can be in one of six
states as far as TM is concerned, encoded in the Machine State
Register (MSR). Certain state transitions are illegal and if attempted
trigger a "TM Bad Thing" type program check exception.
If we ever hit one of these exceptions it's treated as a bug, ie. we
oops, and kill the process and/or panic, depending on configuration.
One case where we can trigger a TM Bad Thing, is when returning to
userspace after a system call or interrupt, using RFID. When this
happens the CPU first restores the user register state, in particular
r1 (the stack pointer) and then attempts to update the MSR. However
the MSR update is not allowed and so we take the program check with
the user register state, but the kernel MSR.
This tricks the exception entry code into thinking we have a bad
kernel stack pointer, because the MSR says we're coming from the
kernel, but r1 is pointing to userspace.
To avoid this we instead always switch to the emergency stack if we
take a TM Bad Thing from the kernel. That way none of the user
register values are used, other than for printing in the oops message.
This is the fix for CVE-2017-1000255.

Commit 41d0c2ecde19 ("powerpc/powernv: Fix local TLB flush for boot

cpufeatures code, specifying the number of sets to flush.
However, these functions take an action argument, not a number of

Memory hot unplug on PowerNV radix hosts is broken. Our memory block

pages, each pte we tear down maps 1GB.
A hot unplug of one 256MB memory block results in 768MB of memory

ALSA: usx2y: Suppress kernel warning at page allocation failures
commit 7682e399485fe19622b6fd82510b1f4551e48a25 upstream.
The usx2y driver allocates the stream read/write buffers in continuous
pages depending on the stream setup, and this may spew the kernel
warning messages with a stack trace like:
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1846 at mm/page\_alloc.c:3883
\_\_alloc\_pages\_slowpath+0x1ef2/0x2d70
Modules linked in:
CPU: 1 PID: 1846 Comm: kworker/1:2 Not tainted
....
It may confuse user as if it were any serious error, although this is
no fatal error and the driver handles the error case gracefully.
Since the driver has already some sanity check of the given size (128
and 256 pages), it can't pass any crazy value. So it's merely page
fragmentation.
This patch adds \_\_GFP\_NOWARN to each caller for suppressing such
kernel warnings. The original issue was spotted by syzkaller.

Revert "ALSA: echoaudio: purge contradictions between dimension matrix members and total number of members"
commit 51db452df07bb4c5754b73789253ba21681d9dc2 upstream.
This reverts commit 275353bb684e to fix a regression which can abort
'alsactl' program in alsa-utils due to assertion in alsa-lib.
alsactl: control.c:2513: snd\_ctl\_elem\_value\_get\_integer: Assertion `idx < sizeof(obj->value.integer.value) / sizeof(obj->value.integer.value[0])' failed.
alsactl: control.c:2976: snd\_ctl\_elem\_value\_get\_integer: Assertion `idx < ARRAY\_SIZE(obj->value.integer.value)' failed.
This commit is a band-aid. In a point of usage of ALSA control interface,
the drivers still bring an issue that they prevent userspace applications
to have a consistent way to parse each levels of the dimension information
via ALSA control interface.
Let me investigate this issue. Current implementation of the drivers
have three control element sets with dimension information:
\* 'Monitor Mixer Volume' (type: integer)
\* 'VMixer Volume' (type: integer)
\* 'VU-meters' (type: boolean)
Although the number of elements named as 'Monitor Mixer Volume' differs
depending on drivers in this group, it can be calculated by macros
defined by each driver (= (BX\_NUM - BX\_ANALOG\_IN) \* BX\_ANALOG\_IN). Each
of the elements has one member for value and has dimension information
with 2 levels (= BX\_ANALOG\_IN \* (BX\_NUM - BX\_ANALOG\_IN)). For these
elements, userspace applications are expected to handle the dimension
information so that all of the elements construct a matrix where the
number of rows and columns are represented by the dimension information.
The same way is applied to elements named as 'VMixer Volume'. The number
of these elements can also be calculated by macros defined by each
drivers (= PX\_ANALOG\_IN \* BX\_ANALOG\_IN). Each of the element has one
member for value and has dimension information with 2 levels
(= BX\_ANALOG\_IN \* PX\_ANALOG\_IN). All of the elements construct a matrix
with the dimension information.
An element named as 'VU-meters' gets a different way in a point of
dimension information. The element includes 96 members for value. The
element has dimension information with 3 levels (= 3 or 2 \* 16 \* 2). For
this element, userspace applications are expected to handle the dimension
information so that all of the members for value construct a matrix
where the number of rows and columns are represented by the dimension
information. This is different from the way for the former.
As a summary, the drivers were not designed to produce a consistent way to
parse the dimension information. This makes it hard for general userspace
applications such as amixer to parse the information by a consistent way,
and actually no userspace applications except for 'echomixer' utilize the
dimension information. Additionally, no drivers excluding this group use
the information.
The reverted commit was written based on the latter way. A commit
860c1994a70a ('ALSA: control: add dimension validator for userspace
elements') is written based on the latter way, too. The patch should be
reconsider too in the same time to re-define a consistent way to parse the
dimension information.

lsm: fix smack\_inode\_removexattr and xattr\_getsecurity memleak
commit 57e7ba04d422c3d41c8426380303ec9b7533ded9 upstream.
security\_inode\_getsecurity() provides the text string value
of a security attribute. It does not provide a "secctx".
The code in xattr\_getsecurity() that calls security\_inode\_getsecurity()
and then calls security\_release\_secctx() happened to work because
SElinux and Smack treat the attribute and the secctx the same way.
It fails for cap\_inode\_getsecurity(), because that module has no
secctx that ever needs releasing. It turns out that Smack is the
one that's doing things wrong by not allocating memory when instructed
to do so by the "alloc" parameter.
The fix is simple enough. Change the security\_release\_secctx() to
kfree() because it isn't a secctx being returned by
security\_inode\_getsecurity(). Change Smack to allocate the string when
told to do so.
Note: this also fixes memory leaks for LSMs which implement
inode\_getsecurity but not release\_secctx, such as capabilities.

lib/ratelimit.c: use deferred printk() version
commit 656d61ce9666209c4c4a13c71902d3ee70d1ff6f upstream.
printk\_ratelimit() invokes \_\_\_ratelimit() which may invoke a normal
printk() (pr\_warn() in this particular case) to warn about suppressed

pr\_warn() is dangerous - it may end up deadlocking the system. Fix
\_\_\_ratelimit() by using deferred printk().

userfaultfd: non-cooperative: fix fork use after free
commit 384632e67e0829deb8015ee6ad916b180049d252 upstream.
When reading the event from the uffd, we put it on a temporary
fork\_event list to detect if we can still access it after releasing and
retaking the event\_wqh.lock.
If fork aborts and removes the event from the fork\_event all is fine as
long as we're still in the userfault read context and fork\_event head is
still alive.
We've to put the event allocated in the fork kernel stack, back from
fork\_event list-head to the event\_wqh head, before returning from
userfaultfd\_ctx\_read, because the fork\_event head lifetime is limited to
the userfaultfd\_ctx\_read stack lifetime.
Forgetting to move the event back to its event\_wqh place then results in
\_\_remove\_wait\_queue(&ctx->event\_wqh, &ewq->wq); in
userfaultfd\_event\_wait\_completion to remove it from a head that has been
already freed from the reader stack.
This could only happen if resolve\_userfault\_fork failed (for example if
there are no file descriptors available to allocate the fork uffd). If
it succeeded it was put back correctly.
Furthermore, after find\_userfault\_evt receives a fork event, the forked
userfault context in fork\_nctx and uwq->msg.arg.reserved.reserved1 can
be released by the fork thread as soon as the event\_wqh.lock is
released. Taking a reference on the fork\_nctx before dropping the lock
prevents an use after free in resolve\_userfault\_fork().
If the fork side aborted and it already released everything, we still
try to succeed resolve\_userfault\_fork(), if possible.

commit 9625456cc76391b7f3f2809579126542a8ed4d39 upstream.
MADV\_FREE clears pte dirty bit and then marks the page lazyfree (clear
SwapBacked). There is no lock to prevent the page is added to swap
cache between these two steps by page reclaim. If page reclaim finds
such page, it will simply add the page to swap cache without pageout the
page to swap because the page is marked as clean. Next time, page fault
will read data from the swap slot which doesn't have the original data,
so we have a data corruption. To fix issue, we mark the page dirty and
pageout the page.
However, we shouldn't dirty all pages which is clean and in swap cache.
swapin page is swap cache and clean too. So we only dirty page which is
added into swap cache in page reclaim, which shouldn't be swapin page.
As Minchan suggested, simply dirty the page in add\_to\_swap can do the
job.

mm: avoid marking swap cached page as lazyfree
commit 24c92eb7dce0a299b8e1a8c5fa585844a53bf7f0 upstream.
MADV\_FREE clears pte dirty bit and then marks the page lazyfree (clear
SwapBacked). There is no lock to prevent the page is added to swap
cache between these two steps by page reclaim. Page reclaim could add
the page to swap cache and unmap the page. After page reclaim, the page
is added back to lru. At that time, we probably start draining per-cpu
pagevec and mark the page lazyfree. So the page could be in a state
with SwapBacked cleared and PG\_swapcache set. Next time there is a
refault in the virtual address, do\_swap\_page can find the page from swap
cache but the page has PageSwapCache false because SwapBacked isn't set,
so do\_swap\_page will bail out and do nothing. The task will keep
running into fault handler.

mm: fix RODATA\_TEST failure "rodata\_test: test data was not read only"
commit a872eb2131e91ce7c89a8888974a5e22a272b12f upstream.
On powerpc, RODATA\_TEST fails with message the following messages:
Freeing unused kernel memory: 528K
rodata\_test: test data was not read only
This is because GCC allocates it to .data section:
c0695034 g O .data 00000004 rodata\_test\_data
Since commit 056b9d8a7692 ("mm: remove rodata\_test\_data export, add
pr\_fmt"), rodata\_test\_data is used only inside rodata\_test.c By
declaring it static, it gets properly allocated into .rodata section
instead of .data:
c04df710 l O .rodata 00000004 rodata\_test\_data

mm, oom\_reaper: skip mm structs with mmu notifiers
commit 4d4bbd8526a8fbeb2c090ea360211fceff952383 upstream.
Andrea has noticed that the oom\_reaper doesn't invalidate the range via
mmu notifiers (mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range\_start/end) and that can
corrupt the memory of the kvm guest for example.
tlb\_flush\_mmu\_tlbonly already invokes mmu notifiers but that is not
sufficient as per Andrea:
"mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range cannot be used in replacement of
mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range\_start/end. For KVM
mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range is a noop and rightfully so. A MMU
notifier implementation has to implement either ->invalidate\_range
method or the invalidate\_range\_start/end methods, not both. And if you
implement invalidate\_range\_start/end like KVM is forced to do, calling
mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range in common code is a noop for KVM.
For those MMU notifiers that can get away only implementing
->invalidate\_range, the ->invalidate\_range is implicitly called by
mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range\_end(). And only those secondary MMUs
that share the same pagetable with the primary MMU (like AMD iommuv2)
can get away only implementing ->invalidate\_range"
As the callback is allowed to sleep and the implementation is out of
hand of the MM it is safer to simply bail out if there is an mmu
notifier registered. In order to not fail too early make the
mm\_has\_notifiers check under the oom\_lock and have a little nap before
failing to give the current oom victim some more time to exit.

mm, hugetlb, soft\_offline: save compound page order before page migration
commit 19bfbe22f59a207417b2679e7e83c180419c9ec5 upstream.
This fixes a bug in madvise() where if you'd try to soft offline a
hugepage via madvise(), while walking the address range you'd end up,
using the wrong page offset due to attempting to get the compound order
of a former but presently not compound page, due to dissolving the huge
page (since commit c3114a84f7f9: "mm: hugetlb: soft-offline: dissolve
source hugepage after successful migration").
As a result I ended up with all my free pages except one being offlined.

IIO: BME280: Updates to Humidity readings need ctrl\_reg write!
commit 4b1f0c31f96c45e8521dd84aae50f2aa4aecfb7b upstream.
The ctrl\_reg register needs to be written after any write to
the humidity registers. The value written to the ctrl\_reg register
does not necessarily need to change, but a write operation must
occur.
The regmap\_update\_bits functions will not write to a register
if the register value matches the value to be written. This saves
unnecessary bus operations. The change in this patch forces a bus
write during the chip\_config operation by switching to
regmap\_write\_bits.
This will fix issues where the Humidity Sensor Oversampling bits
are not updated after initialization.

iio: core: Return error for failed read\_reg
commit 3d62c78a6eb9a7d67bace9622b66ad51e81c5f9b upstream.
If an IIO device returns an error code for a read access via debugfs, it
is currently ignored by the IIO core (other than emitting an error
message). Instead, return this error code to user space, so upper layers
can detect it correctly.

xhci: set missing SuperSpeedPlus Link Protocol bit in roothub descriptor
commit 7bea22b124d77845c85a62eaa29a85ba6cc2f899 upstream.
A SuperSpeedPlus roothub needs to have the Link Protocol (LP) bit set in
the bmSublinkSpeedAttr[] entry of a SuperSpeedPlus descriptor.
If the xhci controller has an optional Protocol Speed ID (PSI) table then
that will be used as a base to create the roothub SuperSpeedPlus
descriptor.
The PSI table does not however necessary contain the LP bit so we need
to set it manually.
Check the psi speed and set LP bit if speed is 10Gbps or higher.
We're not setting it for 5 to 10Gbps as USB 3.1 specification always
mention SuperSpeedPlus for 10Gbps or higher, and some SSIC USB 3.0 speeds
can be over 5Gbps, such as SSIC-G3B-L1 at 5830 Mbps

usb: host: xhci-plat: allow sysdev to inherit from ACPI
commit c6b8e79306f515b5483eb11076e0fbfc140434a8 upstream.
Commit 4c39d4b949d3 ("usb: xhci: use bus->sysdev for DMA configuration")
updated the method determining DMA for XHCI from sysdev. However, this
patch broke the ability to enumerate the FWNODE from parent ACPI devices
from the child plat XHCI device.
Currently, xhci\_plat is not set up properly when the parent device is an
ACPI node. The conditions that xhci\_plat\_probe should satisfy are
1. xhci\_plat comes from firmware
2. xhci\_plat is child of a device from firmware (dwc3-plat)
3. xhci\_plat is grandchild of a pci device (dwc3-pci)
Case 2 is covered when the child is an OF node (by checking
sysdev->parent->of\_node), however, an ACPI parent will return NULL in
the of\_node check and will thus not result in sysdev being set to
sysdev->parent
[ 17.591549] xhci-hcd: probe of xhci-hcd.6.auto failed with error -5
This change adds a check for ACPI to completely allow for condition 2.
This is done by first checking if the parent node is of type ACPI (e.g.,
dwc3-plat) and set sysdev to sysdev->parent if either of the two
following conditions are met:
1: If fwnode is empty (in the case that platform\_device\_add\_properties
was not called on the allocated platform device)
2: fwnode exists but is not of type ACPI (this would happen if
platform\_device\_add\_properties was called on the allocated device.
Instead of type FWNODE\_ACPI, you would end up with FWNODE\_PDATA)

USB: uas: fix bug in handling of alternate settings
commit 786de92b3cb26012d3d0f00ee37adf14527f35c4 upstream.
The uas driver has a subtle bug in the way it handles alternate
settings. The uas\_find\_uas\_alt\_setting() routine returns an
altsetting value (the bAlternateSetting number in the descriptor), but
uas\_use\_uas\_driver() then treats that value as an index to the
intf->altsetting array, which it isn't.
Normally this doesn't cause any problems because the various
alternate settings have bAlternateSetting values 0, 1, 2, ..., so the
value is equal to the index in the array. But this is not guaranteed,
and Andrey Konovalov used the syzkaller fuzzer with KASAN to get a
slab-out-of-bounds error by violating this assumption.
This patch fixes the bug by making uas\_find\_uas\_alt\_setting() return a
pointer to the altsetting entry rather than either the value or the
index. Pointers are less subject to misinterpretation.

USB: g\_mass\_storage: Fix deadlock when driver is unbound
commit 1fbbb78f25d1291274f320462bf6908906f538db upstream.
As a holdover from the old g\_file\_storage gadget, the g\_mass\_storage
legacy gadget driver attempts to unregister itself when its main
operating thread terminates (if it hasn't been unregistered already).
This is not strictly necessary; it was never more than an attempt to
have the gadget fail cleanly if something went wrong and the main
thread was killed.
However, now that the UDC core manages gadget drivers independently of
UDC drivers, this scheme doesn't work any more. A simple test:
modprobe dummy-hcd
modprobe g-mass-storage file=...
rmmod dummy-hcd
ends up in a deadlock with the following backtrace:

What happens is that removing the dummy-hcd driver causes the UDC core
to unbind the gadget driver, which it does while holding the udc\_lock
mutex. The unbind routine in g\_mass\_storage tells the main thread to
exit and waits for it to terminate.
But as mentioned above, when the main thread exits it tries to
unregister the mass-storage function driver. Via the composite
framework this ends up calling usb\_gadget\_unregister\_driver(), which
tries to acquire the udc\_lock mutex. The result is deadlock.
The simplest way to fix the problem is not to be so clever: The main
thread doesn't have to unregister the function driver. The side
effects won't be so terrible; if the gadget is still attached to a USB
host when the main thread is killed, it will appear to the host as
though the gadget's firmware has crashed -- a reasonably accurate
interpretation, and an all-too-common occurrence for USB mass-storage
devices.
In fact, the code to unregister the driver when the main thread exits
is specific to g-mass-storage; it is not used when f-mass-storage is
included as a function in a larger composite device. Therefore the
entire mechanism responsible for this (the fsg\_operations structure
with its ->thread\_exits method, the fsg\_common\_set\_ops() routine, and
the msg\_thread\_exits() callback routine) can all be eliminated. Even
the msg\_registered bitflag can be removed, because now the driver is
unregistered in only one place rather than in two places.

There used to be an integer overflow check in proc\_do\_submiturb() but

uurb->buffer\_length variable is a signed integer and it's controlled by

num\_sgs = DIV\_ROUND\_UP(uurb->buffer\_length, USB\_SG\_SIZE);
If we strip away the macro then that line looks like this:
num\_sgs = (uurb->buffer\_length + USB\_SG\_SIZE - 1) / USB\_SG\_SIZE;
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It's the first addition which can overflow.

USB: dummy-hcd: Fix erroneous synchronization change
commit 7dbd8f4cabd96db5a50513de9d83a8105a5ffc81 upstream.
A recent change to the synchronization in dummy-hcd was incorrect.
The issue was that dummy\_udc\_stop() contained no locking and therefore
could race with various gadget driver callbacks, and the fix was to
add locking and issue the callbacks with the private spinlock held.
UDC drivers aren't supposed to do this. Gadget driver callback
routines are allowed to invoke functions in the UDC driver, and these
functions will generally try to acquire the private spinlock. This
would deadlock the driver.
The correct solution is to drop the spinlock before issuing callbacks,
and avoid races by emulating the synchronize\_irq() call that all real
UDC drivers must perform in their ->udc\_stop() routines after
disabling interrupts. This involves adding a flag to dummy-hcd's
private structure to keep track of whether interrupts are supposed to
be enabled, and adding a counter to keep track of ongoing callbacks so
that dummy\_udc\_stop() can wait for them all to finish.
A real UDC driver won't receive disconnect, reset, suspend, resume, or
setup events once it has disabled interrupts. dummy-hcd will receive
them but won't try to issue any gadget driver callbacks, which should
be just as good.

USB: dummy-hcd: fix infinite-loop resubmission bug
commit 0173a68bfb0ad1c72a6ee39cc485aa2c97540b98 upstream.
The dummy-hcd HCD/UDC emulator tries not to do too much work during
each timer interrupt. But it doesn't try very hard; currently all
it does is limit the total amount of bulk data transferred. Other
transfer types aren't limited, and URBs that transfer no data (because
of an error, perhaps) don't count toward the limit, even though on a
real USB bus they would consume at least a minimum overhead.
This means it's possible to get the driver stuck in an infinite loop,
for example, if the host class driver resubmits an URB every time it
completes (which is common for interrupt URBs). Each time the URB is
resubmitted it gets added to the end of the pending-URBs list, and
dummy-hcd doesn't stop until that list is empty. Andrey Konovalov was
able to trigger this failure mode using the syzkaller fuzzer.
This patch fixes the infinite-loop problem by restricting the URBs
handled during each timer interrupt to those that were already on the
pending list when the interrupt routine started. Newly added URBs

USB: dummy-hcd: fix connection failures (wrong speed)
commit fe659bcc9b173bcfdd958ce2aec75e47651e74e1 upstream.
The dummy-hcd UDC driver is not careful about the way it handles
connection speeds. It ignores the module parameter that is supposed
to govern the maximum connection speed and it doesn't set the HCD
flags properly for the case where it ends up running at full speed.
The result is that in many cases, gadget enumeration over dummy-hcd
fails because the bMaxPacketSize byte in the device descriptor is set
incorrectly. For example, the default settings call for a high-speed
connection, but the maxpacket value for ep0 ends up being set for a
Super-Speed connection.
This patch fixes the problem by initializing the gadget's max\_speed
and the HCD flags correctly.

USB: cdc-wdm: ignore -EPIPE from GetEncapsulatedResponse
commit 8fec9355a968ad240f3a2e9ad55b823cf1cc52ff upstream.
The driver will forward errors to userspace after turning most of them
into -EIO. But all status codes are not equal. The -EPIPE (stall) in
particular can be seen more as a result of normal USB signaling than
an actual error. The state is automatically cleared by the USB core
without intervention from either driver or userspace.
And most devices and firmwares will never trigger a stall as a result
of GetEncapsulatedResponse. This is in fact a requirement for CDC WDM
devices. Quoting from section 7.1 of the CDC WMC spec revision 1.1:
The function shall not return STALL in response to
GetEncapsulatedResponse.
But this driver is also handling GetEncapsulatedResponse on behalf of
the qmi\_wwan and cdc\_mbim drivers. Unfortunately the relevant specs
are not as clear wrt stall. So some QMI and MBIM devices \*will\*
occasionally stall, causing the GetEncapsulatedResponse to return an
-EPIPE status. Translating this into -EIO for userspace has proven to
be harmful. Treating it as an empty read is safer, making the driver
behave as if the device was conforming to the CDC WDM spec.
There have been numerous reports of issues related to -EPIPE errors
from some newer CDC MBIM devices in particular, like for example the
Fibocom L831-EAU. Testing on this device has shown that the issues
go away if we simply ignore the -EPIPE status. Similar handling of
-EPIPE is already known from e.g. usb\_get\_string()
The -EPIPE log message is still kept to let us track devices with this
unexpected behaviour, hoping that it attracts attention from firmware
developers.

usb-storage: fix bogus hardware error messages for ATA pass-thru devices
commit a4fd4a724d6c30ad671046d83be2e9be2f11d275 upstream.
Ever since commit a621bac3044e ("scsi\_lib: correctly retry failed zero
length REQ\_TYPE\_FS commands"), people have been getting bogus error
messages for USB disk drives using ATA pass-thru. For example:
[ 1344.880193] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk
[ 1345.069152] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID\_ERROR driverbyte=DRIVER\_SENSE
[ 1345.069159] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 Sense Key : Hardware Error [current] [descriptor]
[ 1345.069162] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 Add. Sense: No additional sense information
[ 1345.069168] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 CDB: ATA command pass through(16) 85 06 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e5 00
[ 1345.172252] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID\_ERROR driverbyte=DRIVER\_SENSE
[ 1345.172258] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 Sense Key : Hardware Error [current] [descriptor]
[ 1345.172261] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 Add. Sense: No additional sense information
[ 1345.172266] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 CDB: ATA command pass through(12)/Blank a1 06 20 da 00 00 4f c2 00 b0 00 00
These messages can be quite annoying, because programs like udisks2
provoke them every 10 minutes or so. Other programs can also have
this effect, such as those in smartmontools.
I don't fully understand how that commit induced the SCSI core to log
these error messages, but the underlying cause for them is code added
to usb-storage by commit f1a0743bc0e7 ("USB: storage: When a device
returns no sense data, call it a Hardware Error"). At the time it was
necessary to do this, in order to prevent an infinite retry loop with
some not-so-great mass storage devices.
However, the ATA pass-thru protocol uses SCSI sense data to return
command status values, and some devices always report Check Condition
status for ATA pass-thru commands to ensure that the host retrieves
the sense data, even if the command succeeded. This violates the USB
mass-storage protocol (Check Condition status is supposed to mean the
command failed), but we can't help that.
This patch attempts to mitigate the problem of these bogus error
reports by changing usb-storage. The HARDWARE ERROR sense key will be
inserted only for commands that aren't ATA pass-thru.
Thanks to Ewan Milne for pointing out that this mechanism was present
in usb-storage. 8 years after writing it, I had completely forgotten
its existence.

USB: gadgetfs: Fix crash caused by inadequate synchronization
commit 520b72fc64debf8a86c3853b8e486aa5982188f0 upstream.
The gadgetfs driver (drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/inode.c) was written
before the UDC and composite frameworks were adopted; it is a legacy
driver. As such, it expects that once bound to a UDC controller, it
will not be unbound until it unregisters itself.
However, the UDC framework does unbind function drivers while they are
still registered. When this happens, it can cause the gadgetfs driver
to misbehave or crash. For example, userspace can cause a crash by
opening the device file and doing an ioctl call before setting up a
configuration (found by Andrey Konovalov using the syzkaller fuzzer).
This patch adds checks and synchronization to prevent these bad
behaviors. It adds a udc\_usage counter that the driver increments at
times when it is using a gadget interface without holding the private
spinlock. The unbind routine waits for this counter to go to 0 before
returning, thereby ensuring that the UDC is no longer in use.
The patch also adds a check in the dev\_ioctl() routine to make sure
the driver is bound to a UDC before dereferencing the gadget pointer,
and it makes destroy\_ep\_files() synchronize with the endpoint I/O
routines, to prevent the user from accessing an endpoint data
structure after it has been removed.

The JIT bug can be triggered after introduction of BPF\_F\_NUMA\_NODE flag

though JIT code is wrong it will check bounds correctly.

tipc: use only positive error codes in messages
[ Upstream commit aad06212d36cf34859428a0a279e5c14ee5c9e26 ]
In commit e3a77561e7d32 ("tipc: split up function tipc\_msg\_eval()"),
we have updated the function tipc\_msg\_lookup\_dest() to set the error
codes to negative values at destination lookup failures. Thus when
the function sets the error code to -TIPC\_ERR\_NO\_NAME, its inserted
into the 4 bit error field of the message header as 0xf instead of
TIPC\_ERR\_NO\_NAME (1). The value 0xf is an unknown error code.
In this commit, we set only positive error code.

IPv4: early demux can return an error code

Currently no error is emitted, but this infrastructure will

for mcast sockets.
Since early demux can do a route lookup and an ipv4 route
lookup can return an error code this is consistent with the
current ipv4 route infrastructure.

netlink: do not proceed if dump's start() errs
[ Upstream commit fef0035c0f31322d417d1954bba5ab959bf91183 ]
Drivers that use the start method for netlink dumping rely on dumpit not
being called if start fails. For example, ila\_xlat.c allocates memory
and assigns it to cb->args[0] in its start() function. It might fail to
do that and return -ENOMEM instead. However, even when returning an
error, dumpit will be called, which, in the example above, quickly
dereferences the memory in cb->args[0], which will OOPS the kernel. This
is but one example of how this goes wrong.
Since start() has always been a function with an int return type, it
therefore makes sense to use it properly, rather than ignoring it. This
patch thus returns early and does not call dumpit() when start() fails.

net: Set sk\_prot\_creator when cloning sockets to the right proto
[ Upstream commit 9d538fa60bad4f7b23193c89e843797a1cf71ef3 ]
sk->sk\_prot and sk->sk\_prot\_creator can differ when the app uses
IPV6\_ADDRFORM (transforming an IPv6-socket to an IPv4-one).
Which is why sk\_prot\_creator is there to make sure that sk\_prot\_free()
does the kmem\_cache\_free() on the right kmem\_cache slab.
Now, if such a socket gets transformed back to a listening socket (using
connect() with AF\_UNSPEC) we will allocate an IPv4 tcp\_sock through
sk\_clone\_lock() when a new connection comes in. But sk\_prot\_creator will
still point to the IPv6 kmem\_cache (as everything got copied in
sk\_clone\_lock()). When freeing, we will thus put this
memory back into the IPv6 kmem\_cache although it was allocated in the
IPv4 cache. I have seen memory corruption happening because of this.
With slub-debugging and MEMCG\_KMEM enabled this gives the warning
"cache\_from\_obj: Wrong slab cache. TCPv6 but object is from TCP"
A C-program to trigger this:
void main(void)
{
int fd = socket(AF\_INET6, SOCK\_STREAM, IPPROTO\_TCP);
int new\_fd, newest\_fd, client\_fd;
struct sockaddr\_in6 bind\_addr;
struct sockaddr\_in bind\_addr4, client\_addr1, client\_addr2;
struct sockaddr unsp;
int val;
memset(&bind\_addr, 0, sizeof(bind\_addr));
bind\_addr.sin6\_family = AF\_INET6;
bind\_addr.sin6\_port = ntohs(42424);
memset(&client\_addr1, 0, sizeof(client\_addr1));
client\_addr1.sin\_family = AF\_INET;
client\_addr1.sin\_port = ntohs(42424);
client\_addr1.sin\_addr.s\_addr = inet\_addr("127.0.0.1");
memset(&client\_addr2, 0, sizeof(client\_addr2));
client\_addr2.sin\_family = AF\_INET;
client\_addr2.sin\_port = ntohs(42421);
client\_addr2.sin\_addr.s\_addr = inet\_addr("127.0.0.1");
memset(&unsp, 0, sizeof(unsp));
unsp.sa\_family = AF\_UNSPEC;
bind(fd, (struct sockaddr \*)&bind\_addr, sizeof(bind\_addr));
listen(fd, 5);
client\_fd = socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM, IPPROTO\_TCP);
connect(client\_fd, (struct sockaddr \*)&client\_addr1, sizeof(client\_addr1));
new\_fd = accept(fd, NULL, NULL);
close(fd);
val = AF\_INET;
setsockopt(new\_fd, SOL\_IPV6, IPV6\_ADDRFORM, &val, sizeof(val));
connect(new\_fd, &unsp, sizeof(unsp));
memset(&bind\_addr4, 0, sizeof(bind\_addr4));
bind\_addr4.sin\_family = AF\_INET;
bind\_addr4.sin\_port = ntohs(42421);
bind(new\_fd, (struct sockaddr \*)&bind\_addr4, sizeof(bind\_addr4));
listen(new\_fd, 5);

newest\_fd = accept(new\_fd, NULL, NULL);
close(new\_fd);

close(new\_fd);
}

We cannot be registering the network device first, then setting its

window during which the carrier is at best inconsistent, and at worse
the device is not usable without a down/up sequence since the network
device is visible to user space with possibly no PHY device attached.
Re-order steps so that they make logical sense. This fixes some devices
where the port was not usable after e.g: an unbind then bind of the

l2tp: fix race condition in l2tp\_tunnel\_delete
[ Upstream commit 62b982eeb4589b2e6d7c01a90590e3a4c2b2ca19 ]
If we try to delete the same tunnel twice, the first delete operation
does a lookup (l2tp\_tunnel\_get), finds the tunnel, calls
l2tp\_tunnel\_delete, which queues it for deletion by
l2tp\_tunnel\_del\_work.
The second delete operation also finds the tunnel and calls
l2tp\_tunnel\_delete. If the workqueue has already fired and started
running l2tp\_tunnel\_del\_work, then l2tp\_tunnel\_delete will queue the
same tunnel a second time, and try to free the socket again.
Add a dead flag to prevent firing the workqueue twice. Then we can
remove the check of queue\_work's result that was meant to prevent that
race but doesn't.

isdn/i4l: fetch the ppp\_write buffer in one shot
[ Upstream commit 02388bf87f72e1d47174cd8f81c34443920eb5a0 ]
In isdn\_ppp\_write(), the header (i.e., protobuf) of the buffer is
fetched twice from userspace. The first fetch is used to peek at the
protocol of the message and reset the huptimer if necessary; while the
second fetch copies in the whole buffer. However, given that buf resides
in userspace memory, a user process can race to change its memory content
across fetches. By doing so, we can either avoid resetting the huptimer
for any type of packets (by first setting proto to PPP\_LCP and later
change to the actual type) or force resetting the huptimer for LCP
packets.
This patch changes this double-fetch behavior into two single fetches
decided by condition (lp->isdn\_device < 0 || lp->isdn\_channel <0).

net: change skb->mac\_header when Generic XDP calls adjust\_head
[ Upstream commit 92dd5452c1be873a1193561f4f691763103d22ac ]
Since XDP's view of the packet includes the MAC header, moving the start-
of-packet with bpf\_xdp\_adjust\_head needs to also update the offset of the
MAC header (which is relative to skb->head, not to the skb->data that was
changed).
Without this, tcpdump sees packets starting from the old MAC header rather
than the new one, at least in my tests on the loopback device.

bpf: one perf event close won't free bpf program attached by another perf event
[ Upstream commit ec9dd352d591f0c90402ec67a317c1ed4fb2e638 ]
This patch fixes a bug exhibited by the following scenario:
1. fd1 = perf\_event\_open with attr.config = ID1
2. attach bpf program prog1 to fd1
3. fd2 = perf\_event\_open with attr.config = ID1
4. user program closes fd2 and prog1 is detached from the tracepoint.
5. user program with fd1 does not work properly as tracepoint
no output any more.
The issue happens at step 4. Multiple perf\_event\_open can be called
successfully, but only one bpf prog pointer in the tp\_event. In the
current logic, any fd release for the same tp\_event will free
the tp\_event->prog.
The fix is to free tp\_event->prog only when the closing fd
corresponds to the one which registered the program.

packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hook
[ Upstream commit 008ba2a13f2d04c947adc536d19debb8fe66f110 ]
Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind\_lock. This keeps
po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
list to receive packets.
fanout\_add unbinds a socket and its packet\_rcv/tpacket\_rcv call, then
binds the fanout object to receive through packet\_rcv\_fanout.
Make it hold the po->bind\_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
packet\_set\_ring from packet\_rcv to tpacket\_rcv. Concurrent updates
can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.
Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

net: ipv6: fix regression of no RTM\_DELADDR sent after DAD failure
[ Upstream commit 6819a14ecbe2e089e5c5bb74edecafdde2028a00 ]
Commit f784ad3d79e5 ("ipv6: do not send RTM\_DELADDR for tentative
addresses") incorrectly assumes that no RTM\_NEWADDR are sent for
addresses in tentative state, as this does happen for the standard
IPv6 use-case of DAD failure, see the call to ipv6\_ifa\_notify() in
addconf\_dad\_stop(). So as a result of this change, no RTM\_DELADDR is
sent after DAD failure for a link-local when strict DAD (accept\_dad=2)
is configured, or on the next admin down in other cases. The absence
of this notification breaks backwards compatibility and causes problems
after DAD failure if this notification was being relied on. The
solution is to allow RTM\_DELADDR to still be sent after DAD failure.

net: emac: Fix napi poll list corruption
[ Upstream commit f55956065ec94e3e9371463d693a1029c4cc3007 ]
This patch is pretty much a carbon copy of
commit 3079c652141f ("caif: Fix napi poll list corruption")
with "caif" replaced by "emac".
The commit d75b1ade567f ("net: less interrupt masking in NAPI")
breaks emac.
It is now required that if the entire budget is consumed when poll
returns, the napi poll\_list must remain empty. However, like some
other drivers emac tries to do a last-ditch check and if there is
more work it will call napi\_reschedule and then immediately process
some of this new work. Should the entire budget be consumed while
processing such new work then we will violate the new caller
contract.
This patch fixes this by not touching any work when we reschedule
in emac.

tcp: fastopen: fix on syn-data transmit failure
[ Upstream commit b5b7db8d680464b1d631fd016f5e093419f0bfd9 ]
Our recent change exposed a bug in TCP Fastopen Client that syzkaller
found right away [1]
When we prepare skb with SYN+DATA, we attempt to transmit it,
and we update socket state as if the transmit was a success.
In socket RTX queue we have two skbs, one with the SYN alone,
and a second one containing the DATA.
When (malicious) ACK comes in, we now complain that second one had no
skb\_mstamp.
The proper fix is to make sure that if the transmit failed, we do not
pretend we sent the DATA skb, and make it our send\_head.
When 3WHS completes, we can now send the DATA right away, without having
to wait for a timeout.

Another solution would be to change htab\_map\_delete\_elem() to

ping $address -c1
tc -s c s dev en0
classifies traffic to 1:b or 1:a, depending on whether the packet matches
or not the pattern $clsargs of filter $clsname. However, when $clsname is
'matchall', a systematic crash can be observed in htb\_classify(). HTB and
classful qdiscs don't assign initial value to struct tcf\_result, but then
they expect it to contain valid values after filters have been run. Thus,
current 'matchall' ignores the TCA\_MATCHALL\_CLASSID attribute, configured
by user, and makes HTB (and classful qdiscs) dereference random pointers.
By assigning head->res to \*res in mall\_classify(), before the actions are
invoked, we fix this crash and enable TCA\_MATCHALL\_CLASSID functionality,
that had no effect on 'matchall' classifier since its first introduction.

in tcp\_probe\_timer() :
https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg454496.html
After investigations, the root cause of the problem is that we update
skb->skb\_mstamp of skbs in write queue, even if the attempt to send a
clone or copy of it failed. One reason being a routing problem.
This patch prevents this, solving liujian issue.
It also removes a potential RTT miscalculation, since
\_\_tcp\_retransmit\_skb() is not OR-ing TCP\_SKB\_CB(skb)->sacked with
TCPCB\_EVER\_RETRANS if a failure happens, but skb->skb\_mstamp has
been changed.
A future ACK would then lead to a very small RTT sample and min\_rtt
would then be lowered to this too small value.
Tested:

sctp: potential read out of bounds in sctp\_ulpevent\_type\_enabled()
[ Upstream commit fa5f7b51fc3080c2b195fa87c7eca7c05e56f673 ]
This code causes a static checker warning because Smatch doesn't trust
anything that comes from skb->data. I've reviewed this code and I do
think skb->data can be controlled by the user here.
The sctp\_event\_subscribe struct has 13 \_\_u8 fields and we want to see
if ours is non-zero. sn\_type can be any value in the 0-USHRT\_MAX range.
We're subtracting SCTP\_SN\_TYPE\_BASE which is 1 << 15 so we could read
either before the start of the struct or after the end.
This is a very old bug and it's surprising that it would go undetected
for so long but my theory is that it just doesn't have a big impact so
it would be hard to notice.

net\_sched: gen\_estimator: fix scaling error in bytes/packets samples
[ Upstream commit ca558e185972d8ecd308760abf972f5d408bcff0 ]
Denys reported wrong rate estimations with HTB classes.
It appears the bug was added in linux-4.10, since my tests
where using intervals of one second only.
HTB using 4 sec default rate estimators, reported rates
were 4x higher.
We need to properly scale the bytes/packets samples before
integrating them in EWMA.

net: bonding: fix tlb\_dynamic\_lb default value
[ Upstream commit f13ad104b4e886a03e75f130daf579ef9bf33dfc ]
Commit 8b426dc54cf4 ("bonding: remove hardcoded value") changed the
default value for tlb\_dynamic\_lb which lead to either broken ALB mode
(since tlb\_dynamic\_lb can be changed only in TLB) or setting TLB mode
with tlb\_dynamic\_lb equal to 0.
The first issue was recently fixed by setting tlb\_dynamic\_lb to 1 always
when switching to ALB mode, but the default value is still wrong and
we'll enter TLB mode with tlb\_dynamic\_lb equal to 0 if the mode is
changed via netlink or sysfs. In order to restore the previous behaviour
and default value simply remove the mode check around the default param
initialization for tlb\_dynamic\_lb which will always set it to 1 as
before.

mlxsw: spectrum: Prevent mirred-related crash on removal
[ Upstream commit 6399ebcccffa12e65bc15eda039d37673264ebce ]
When removing the offloading of mirred actions under
matchall classifiers, mlxsw would find the destination port
associated with the offloaded action and utilize it for undoing
the configuration.
Depending on the order by which ports are removed, it's possible that
the destination port would get removed before the source port.
In such a scenario, when actions would be flushed for the source port
mlxsw would perform an illegal dereference as the destination port is
no longer listed.
Since the only item necessary for undoing the configuration on the
destination side is the port-id and that in turn is already maintained
by mlxsw on the source-port, simply stop trying to access the
destination port and use the port-id directly instead.

net: bonding: Fix transmit load balancing in balance-alb mode if specified by sysfs
[ Upstream commit c6644d07eff6588b2dedf881279fb0d1c7783970 ]
Commit cbf5ecb30560 ("net: bonding: Fix transmit load balancing in
balance-alb mode") tried to fix transmit dynamic load balancing in
balance-alb mode, which wasn't working after commit 8b426dc54cf4
("bonding: remove hardcoded value").
It turned out that my previous patch only fixed the case when
balance-alb was specified as bonding module parameter, and not when
balance-alb mode was set using /sys/class/net/\*/bonding/mode (the most
common usage). In the latter case, tlb\_dynamic\_lb was set up according
to the default mode of the bonding interface, which happens to be
balance-rr.
This additional patch addresses this issue by setting up tlb\_dynamic\_lb
to 1 if "mode" is set to balance-alb through the sysfs interface.
I didn't add code to change tlb\_balance\_lb back to the default value for
other modes, because "mode" is usually set up only once during
initialization, and it's not worthwhile to change the static variable
bonding\_defaults in bond\_main.c to a global variable just for this
purpose.
Commit 8b426dc54cf4 also changes the value of tlb\_dynamic\_lb for
balance-tlb mode if it is set up using the sysfs interface. I didn't
change that behavior, because the value of tlb\_balance\_lb can be changed
using the sysfs interface for balance-tlb, and I didn't like changing
the default value back and forth for balance-tlb.
As for balance-alb, /sys/class/net/\*/bonding/tlb\_balance\_lb cannot be
written to. However, I think balance-alb with tlb\_dynamic\_lb set to 0
is not an intended usage, so there is little use making it writable at
this moment.

imx-media-of: avoid uninitialized variable warning
Replaces upstream commit 0b2e9e7947e7 ("media: staging/imx: remove
confusing IS\_ERR\_OR\_NULL usage")
We get a harmless warning about a potential uninitialized variable
use in the driver:
drivers/staging/media/imx/imx-media-of.c: In function 'of\_parse\_subdev':
drivers/staging/media/imx/imx-media-of.c:216:4: warning: 'remote\_np' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
I reworked that code to be easier to understand by gcc in mainline,
but that commit is too large to backport. This is a much simpler
workaround, avoiding the warning by adding a fake initialization
to the variable. The driver was only introduced in linux-4.13,
so the workaround is not needed for earlier stable kernels.

There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. | | | Clone Of: | [1518955](show_bug.cgi?id=1518955) | | | Clones: | [CVE-2017-5715](show_bug.cgi?id=1519780 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5715 hw: cpu: speculative execution branch target injection")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1519780)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-04-25 14:32:33 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1519778#c0)  Petr Matousek    2017-12-01 12:58:09 UTC  ``` An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.  Variant [CVE-2017-5753](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5753) triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1519778#c4)  Petr Matousek    2018-01-03 19:01:20 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Google Project Zero   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1519778#c6)  Petr Matousek    2018-01-03 19:16:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0152)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's key management system where it was possible for an attacker to escalate privileges or crash the machine. If a user key gets negatively instantiated, an error code is cached in the payload area. A negatively instantiated key may be then be positively instantiated by updating it with valid data. However, the ->update key type method must be aware that the error code may be there. (CVE-2015-8539, Important)
* It was found that fanout\_add() in 'net/packet/af\_packet.c' in the Linux kernel, before version 4.13.6, allows local users to gain privileges via crafted system calls that trigger mishandling of packet\_fanout data structures, because of a race condition (involving fanout\_add and packet\_do\_bind) that leads to a use-after-free bug. (CVE-2017-15649, Important)
* A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel where the keyctl\_set\_reqkey\_keyring() function leaks the thread keyring. This allows an unprivileged local user to exhaust kernel memory and thus cause a DoS. (CVE-2017-7472, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Dmitry Vyukov of Google engineering for reporting CVE-2015-8539.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to 3.10.0-693.15.1 source tree, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1519506)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

Debian Bug     : 865303 865416

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10208

    Sergej Schumilo and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that a crafted ext4
    filesystem could trigger memory corruption when it is mounted.  A
    user that can provide a device or filesystem image to be mounted
    could use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-8824

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

CVE-2017-8831

    Pengfei Wang discovered that the saa7164 video capture driver
    re-reads data from a PCI device after validating it.  A physically
    present user able to attach a specially designed PCI device could
    use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12190

    Vitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the block layer did not
    correctly count page references for raw I/O from user-space.  This
    can be exploited by a guest VM with access to a host SCSI device
    for denial of service (memory exhaustion) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-13080

    A vulnerability was found in the WPA2 protocol that could lead to
    reinstallation of the same Group Temporal Key (GTK), which
    substantially reduces the security of wifi encryption.  This is
    one of the issues collectively known as "KRACK".

    Updates to GTKs are usually handled by the wpa package, where this
    issue was already fixed (DLA-1150-1).  However, some wifi devices
    can remain active and update GTKs autonomously while the system is
    suspended.  The kernel must also check for and ignore key
    reinstallation.

CVE-2017-14051

    "shqking" reported that the qla2xxx SCSI host driver did not
    correctly validate I/O to the "optrom" sysfs attribute of the
    devices it creates.  This is unlikely to have any security
    impact.

CVE-2017-15115

    Vladis Dronov reported that the SCTP implementation did not
    correctly handle "peel-off" of an association to another net
    namespace.  This leads to a use-after-free, which a local user can
    exploit for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that do not already
    have the sctp module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling
    it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false

CVE-2017-15265

    Michael23 Yu reported a race condition in the ALSA sequencer
    subsystem involving creation and deletion of ports, which could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with access to an ALSA
    sequencer device can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    loss) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15299

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem did not correctly
    handle update of an uninstantiated key, leading to a null
    dereference.  A local user can use this for denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-15649

    "nixioaming" reported a race condition in the packet socket
    (AF_PACKET) implementation involving rebinding to a fanout group,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with the
    CAP_NET_RAW capability can use this for denial of service (crash
    or data corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15868

    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol
    (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of the second
    socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to
    memory corruption.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16525

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB serial console
    implementation did not correctly handle disconnection of unusual
    serial devices, leading to a use-after-free.  A similar issue was
    found in the case where setup of a serial console fails.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or data corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16527

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound mixer driver did not
    correctly cancel I/O in case it failed to probe a device, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-16529

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound driver did not fully
    validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16531

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB core did not validate IAD
    lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device may be able to
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16532

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB test driver did not
    correctly handle devices with specific combinations of endpoints.
    A physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16533

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB HID driver did not fully
    validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16535

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB core did not validate BOS
    descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device may
    be able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16536

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the cx231xx video capture driver
    did not fully validate the device endpoint configuration, which
    could lead to a null dereference.  A physically present user with
    a specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2017-16537

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the imon RC driver did not fully
    validate the device interface configuration, which could lead to a
    null dereference.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16643

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the gtco tablet driver did not
    fully validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16649

    Bjørn Mork found that the cdc_ether network driver did not
    validate the device's maximum segment size, potentially leading to
    a division by zero.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16939

    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam
    Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec (xfrm) implementation
    did not correctly handle some failure cases when dumping policy
    information through netlink.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-1000407

    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.96-2.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions
up to and including 3.2.96.  It also fixes some regressions caused by
the fix for CVE-2017-1000364, which was included in DLA-993-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0181)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's key management system where it was possible for an attacker to escalate privileges or crash the machine. If a user key gets negatively instantiated, an error code is cached in the payload area. A negatively instantiated key may be then be positively instantiated by updating it with valid data. However, the ->update key type method must be aware that the error code may be there. (CVE-2015-8539, Important)
* It was found that fanout\_add() in 'net/packet/af\_packet.c' in the Linux kernel, before version 4.13.6, allows local users to gain privileges via crafted system calls that trigger mishandling of packet\_fanout data structures, because of a race condition (involving fanout\_add and packet\_do\_bind) that leads to a use-after-free bug. (CVE-2017-15649, Important)
* A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel where the keyctl\_set\_reqkey\_keyring() function leaks the thread keyring. This allows an unprivileged local user to exhaust kernel memory and thus cause a DoS. (CVE-2017-7472, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Dmitry Vyukov of Google engineering for reporting CVE-2015-8539.

Bug Fix(es):

* The mlx5 driver has a number of configuration options, including the selective support for network protocols, such as InfiniBand and Ethernet. Due to a regression in the configuration of the MRG-RT kernel, the Ethernet mode of the driver was turned off. The regression has been resolved by enabling the mlx5 Ethernet mode, making the Ethernet protocol to work again. (BZ#1422778)
* The migrate\_disable/enable() kernel operations are used to pin a thread to a CPU temporarily. This method is a kernel-rt specific. To keep RHEL-RT's kernel up-to-date with the latest real-time kernel, the migrate\_disable/enable routine was updated to the version present on kernel v4.9-rt. However, this version showed to be problematic. The changes in the migrate\_disable/enabled have been thus reverted to a stable version, avoiding the kernel BUG. (BZ#1507831)
* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-693.15.1.rt56.601, which provides a number of security and bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1519504)

packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hook

```
Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind_lock. This keeps
po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
list to receive packets.

fanout_add unbinds a socket and its packet_rcv/tpacket_rcv call, then
binds the fanout object to receive through packet_rcv_fanout.

Make it hold the po->bind_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
packet_set_ring from packet_rcv to tpacket_rcv. Concurrent updates
can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.

Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind_lock. This keeps
po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
list to receive packets.

fanout_add unbinds a socket and its packet_rcv/tpacket_rcv call, then
binds the fanout object to receive through packet_rcv_fanout.

Make it hold the po->bind_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
packet_set_ring from packet_rcv to tpacket_rcv. Concurrent updates
can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.

Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

It seems sk_ref is always read/changed under
mutex_lock(&fanout_mutex) protection.

Not sure why we use a refcount_t (or an atomic_t in older kernels)

All these atomic/spinlock/mutexes are a maze.

As you move the po->running check later after setting po->rollover, I wonder
if po->rollover possibly depends on po>running on other path?

This looks correct but still seems odd, it smells you don't use refcnt in an
expected way.

The rollover code does not explicitly check po->running, if that is
what you are concerned about.

A newly allocated po->rollover structure will also only be accessed
from the datapath once the socket is added to a fanout group. Both
before and after this patch, that happens well after the po->running
check.

If the socket already had a po->rollover, then it must already have
had a po->fanout, too, so fanout_add does not reach this code.

It tests whether the object has no references, in which case it must have
been newly allocated and the fanout join operation must have failed.

I don't see an obviously simpler patch.

The entire code could perhaps be restructured eventually. There is,
for instance, no reason to test match->{type, prot_hook.type, prot_hook.dev}
when having just allocated the structure. Nor to test whether sk_ref exceeds
PACKET_FANOUT_MAX. Conversely, this sk_ref == 0 test only makes sense
when having taken the (!match) branch earlier.

But a refactor is out of scope for a bug fix.

Applied and queued up for stable as it fixes this race and I can't
see any new problems it introduces.

But boy is this one messy area.

The scariest thing to me now is the save/restore sequence done by
packet_set_ring(), for example.

	spin_lock(&po->bind_lock);
	was_running = po->running;
	num = po->num;
	if (was_running) {
		po->num = 0;
		__unregister_prot_hook(sk, false);
	}

	spin_lock(&po->bind_lock);
	if (was_running) {
		po->num = num;
		register_prot_hook(sk);
	}
	spin_unlock(&po->bind_lock);

The socket is also locked during this sequence but that doesn't
prevent parallel changes to the running state.

Since po->bind_lock is dropped, it's possible for another thread
to grab bind_lock and bind it meanwhile.

The above code seems to assume that can't happen, and that
register_prot_hook() will always see po->running set to zero
and rebind the socket.

If the race happens we'll have weird state, because we did not
rebind yet we modified po->num.

We seem to have a hierachy of sleeping and non-sleeping locks
that do not work well together.

Yeah, I've been staring at this code for a while now. But I don't see
an obvious way to simplify it. packet_notifier does not hold the socket
lock, so even if all of bind, set_ring and fanout_add do hold that,
bind_lock is still needed. packet_mmap may not take the socket lock,
so pg_vec_lock must remain to synchronize with packet_set_ring
even if for no other reason. I had a look at using rcu pointers for rx_ring
and tx_ring, to avoid taking that lock in the datapath and possibly updating
without the unbind/bind dance. But that update needs to be atomic with
purging the socket queue, so the socket must be properly quiesced.

It appears that the only path that may try to bind without holding the
socket lock is packet_notifier. That skips register_prot_hook if !po->num.

Given the number recent bugs that were fixed by locking the socket
inside a particular setsockopt case, I think that we should lock that
entire function, similar to other protocol families (after verifying that
all cases can indeed sleep).

Another issue that looks fragile is the test for po->fanout in
packet_do_bind before taking the socket lock.

packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hookPacket socket bind operations must hold the po->bind\_lock. This keeps
po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
list to receive packets.
fanout\_add unbinds a socket and its packet\_rcv/tpacket\_rcv call, then
binds the fanout object to receive through packet\_rcv\_fanout.
Make it hold the po->bind\_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
packet\_set\_ring from packet\_rcv to tpacket\_rcv. Concurrent updates
can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.
Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0151)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.

Note: This issue is present in hardware and cannot be fully fixed via software update. The updated kernel packages provide software mitigation for this hardware issue at a cost of potential performance penalty. Please refer to References section for further information about this issue and the performance impact.

In this update initial mitigations for IBM Power (PowerPC) and IBM zSeries (S390) architectures are provided.

* Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses S390 processors. (CVE-2017-5715, Important)
* Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses S390 and PowerPC processors. (CVE-2017-5753, Important)
* Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. Note: CVE-2017-5754 affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this issue. This fix specifically addresses PowerPC processors. (CVE-2017-5754, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5754.

This update also fixes the following security issues and bugs:

Red Hat has been made aware of multiple microarchitectural (hardware) implementation issues affecting many modern microprocessors, requiring updates to the Linux kernel, virtualization-related components, and/or in combination with a microcode update.  An unprivileged attacker can use these flaws to bypass conventional memory security restrictions in order to gain read access to privileged memory that would otherwise be inaccessible. There are 3 known CVEs related to this issue in combination with Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures. Additional exploits for other architectures are also known to exist. These include IBM System Z,  POWER8 (Big Endian and Little Endian), and POWER9 (Little Endian).

## Background Information

An industry-wide issue was found with the manner in which many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. All three rely upon the fact that modern high performance microprocessors implement both speculative execution, and utilize VIPT (Virtually Indexed, Physically Tagged) level 1 data caches that may become allocated with data in the kernel virtual address space during such speculation.

The first two variants abuse speculative execution to perform bounds-check bypass ([CVE-2017-5753](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5753)), or by utilizing branch target injection ([CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715)) to cause kernel code at an address under attacker control to execute speculatively. Collectively these are known as "Spectre".  Both variants rely upon the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code, as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor’s level 1 data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire).  As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use these two flaws to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. These variants could be used not only to cross syscall boundary (variant 1 and variant 2) but also guest/host boundary (variant 2).

The third variant ([CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754)) relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. Researchers have called this exploit "Meltdown".  Subsequent memory accesses may cause an allocation into the L1 data cache even when they reference otherwise inaccessible memory locations. As a result, an unprivileged local attacker could read privileged (kernel space) memory (including arbitrary physical memory locations on a host) by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.

While Red Hat's Linux Containers are not directly impacted by kernel issues, their security relies upon the integrity of the host kernel environment. Red Hat recommends that you use the most recent versions of your container images. The Container Health Index, part of the [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/), can always be used to verify the security status of Red Hat containers. To protect the privacy of the containers in use, you will need to ensure that the Container host (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or [Atomic Host](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/enterprise-linux-atomic-host-datasheet)) has been updated against these attacks. Red Hat has released an updated Atomic Host for this use case.

## Attack Description and Impact

The attacks described in this article abuse the speculative execution capability of modern high-performance microprocessors. Modern microprocessors implement a design optimization known as “Out-of-Order” (OoO) execution, meaning the microprocessor will begin to execute independent instructions as soon as their data dependencies become available (so-called “data flow” model) rather than always executing instructions in the literal order provided by the programmer through their application binary. The illusion of a sequential execution is maintained within the processor by means of various internal reordering structures that buffer these intermediate execution states of the processor and present the in-order results. Out-of-Order (OoO) Execution was originally invented by Robert Tomasulo in 1967 for use in the early IBM mainframe systems. In the intervening decades, it has become a standard feature of nearly all microprocessors.

An extension of the Out-of-Order execution model adds highly sophisticated branch prediction algorithms that aim to predict whether a given path (branch) of software code will be executed. A branch can be thought of as changing the flow of instructions being executed by the processor in response to an “if” statement of the form “if this, then do A, otherwise do B”. The condition upon which a branch is taken or not taken often depends upon data that may not immediately be available (for example, because it requires a load from slower RAM into the internal microprocessor cache hierarchy). Since the branch condition may not be ready in a timely manner, the processor may begin to speculatively execute the most likely path, based on input from the branch predictor. Results from this execution are stored in such a manner that the entire path can be discarded if the speculated branch direction later turns out to be incorrect. Thus, speculative execution is normally completely invisible to the programmer, or to other users of the same system.

The attacks described in this article rely upon breaking open the black box that is the internal state of the microprocessor during speculative execution. In particular, the attacks rely upon a technique known as cache side-channel analysis. During speculative execution, a processor will not intermediately make results available in memory or registers visible to the programmer, to other processors, or to other running applications. Yet, in order to access memory within speculated code paths, it must bring the data in the processor cache. Side-channel analysis allows an attacker to observe speculated allocations (loads) into the system caches, even those coming from execution paths that ultimately have been discarded. A specially crafted program can then be designed to speculatively perform loads into the cache from privileged memory locations, and monitor the results which can be used to infer the content of that privileged memory.

One case that triggers CPU speculative execution is branches. An attacker can start by training the branch predictor that a particular branch in kernel code is heavily taken (or not taken). The next time the branch executes, the processor will start executing the code in the direction chosen by the attacker. If the attacker chooses a path that loads a value from memory, such load will be executed speculatively.  Attacks against branch prediction can (in some affected microprocessor implementations) be extended across the kernel/hypervisor boundary, allowing unprivileged guest Operating Systems to exert influence over the execution of the hypervisor and, when combined with side-channel analysis, to extract sensitive hypervisor memory.

The effects of speculative execution however can be even more wide-ranging. Because the internal state of the microprocessor is not visible to the programmer, or to other users or applications running on the system, the processor may perform speculative data accesses even before checking whether they are permitted. Permission checks will occur in parallel and ultimately trigger an abort of the speculation prior to retiring the speculated instructions and making their execution results visible outside the processor. If the processor speculatively uses cached data from memory prior to completing the permission checks, then it becomes possible to observe that data by using it in subsequent memory accesses.

One example of such permission checks is page access checks from the memory management unit (MMU). Paging, also known as virtual memory, is a common feature of high performance microprocessors; it lets the operating system control the mapping of virtual addresses into the physical addresses of the system RAM, and also limit accesses to the virtual addresses through access control bits. For example, a page can be marked as “read-only” (so that writes cause a page fault exception) or as “kernel memory” (so that user-mode accesses cause a page fault exception).

Because the processor’s permission checks enforce that user applications cannot access kernel memory, it is standard practice in the industry for operating system kernels (including Linux) to map kernel virtual memory addresses into the same address space as user applications. Doing so creates a significant performance advantage since applications make frequent use of kernel-provided system calls, and switching address spaces during each system call would incur a significant performance overhead. Each switch would require flushing (invalidating) the content of many internal CPU structures, such as TLBs (Translation Lookaside Buffers) that cache virtual-to-physical memory translations and accelerate the use of virtual memory.

Sharing the page tables between the kernel and user applications, however, enables another kind of attack against speculative execution. In this case, the preparatory phase has the attacker trick the kernel into loading an “interesting” virtual address into the processor’s Level 1 (L1) data cache. The L1 data cache is commonly organized using a technique known as VIPT (Virtually Indexed, Physically Tagged), which lets the virtual-to-physical address translation and permission checks occur in parallel with access. In the presence of a shared virtual address space, kernel privileged virtual addresses might be accessed speculatively through the L1 cache by untrusted user code during speculative execution, and the loaded values can be used further down the speculatively-executed path. A second speculative memory access can thus fill the cache in a manner that depends on privileged memory contents, and the effects can be observed to derive those contents.

These microprocessor side-channel attacks may allow an untrusted user with access to a machine to extract sensitive information from privileged kernel or hypervisor memory, as well as from other applications or virtual machines running on the same system. Mitigation involves a number of discrete steps, some or all of which may be required depending upon the exact make and model of the microprocessor, each of which may be vulnerable to a differing extent to each variant of the attack:

* **Separating the kernel and user virtual address spaces:** this is performed using a design change to the Operating System kernel known as KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation), sometimes referred to using the older name “KAISER”.
* **Disabling indirect branch prediction upon entry into the kernel or into the hypervisor:** New capabilities have been added to many microprocessors across the industry through microcode, millicode, firmware, and other updates. These new capabilities are leveraged by updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux which control their use.
* **Fencing speculative loads of certain memory locations:** Such loads have to be annotated through small changes to the Linux kernel, which have been integrated into Red Hat updates.

These software solutions, in combination with microcode, millicode, and firmware updates can mitigate the attacks described in this article. However, the mitigation comes at some cost to system performance. Depending upon the specific system, make, and model of the microprocessors, as well as the characteristics of the workloads, the performance impact can be significant. Red Hat is taking a proactive position that favors security over performance, while allowing users the flexibility to assess their own environment and make appropriate tradeoffs through selectively enabling and disabling the various mitigations.

The Red Hat Performance Engineering team has created a [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3307751) reporting observed performance impact for a variety of representative workloads, and describing options users can take to disable parts of the security fixes to regain the desired level of performance if the customer is confident their computers are physically isolated.  Additional performance data will be published as this incident develops.

The Red Hat Performance Engineering and Product Engineering teams have developed a [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3311301) detailing the tunables available to selectively enable or disable these new security features.

**[CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (variant 3, aka Meltdown) patches for 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**

Red Hat has no current plans to provide mitigations for the Meltdown vulnerability in 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environments.

Following many hours of engineering investigation and analysis, Red Hat has determined that introducing changes to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment would destabilize customer deployments and violate our  application binary interface (ABI) and kernel ABI commitments to customers who rely on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to be absolutely stable.

Although Red Hat has delivered patches to mitigate the Meltdown vulnerability in other supported product offerings, the 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment presents unique challenges.  The combination of limited address space in 32-bit environments plus the mechanism for passing control from the userspace to kernel and limitations on the stack during this transfer make the projected changes too invasive and disruptive for deployments that require the highest level of system stability.  By contrast, 32-bit Meltdown mitigations have been delivered for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, where the changes are far less invasive and risky.

## Mitigation

There is no known mitigation, other than applying vendor software updates combined with hardware OEMs CPU microcode/fiirmware. All Red Hat customers should apply vendor solutions to patch their CPUs, and update the kernel as soon as patches are available.

Customers are advised to take a risk-based approach in mitigating this issue.  Systems that require high degrees of security and trust should be addressed first, and should be isolated from untrusted systems until such time as treatments can be applied to those systems to reduce the risk of exploit.

Customers running Xen hypervisors should be aware of technical limitations of that software that cannot completely eliminate the variant 2 exploit, and cannot eliminate the variant 3 exploit on paravirtualized guests.  Red Hat has prepared a [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3307791) detailing the Xen situation and options available to Xen hypervisor users.

From: Willem de Bruijn <willemb@google.com>

Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
across sockets in the group.

If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
with that of the fanout group.

Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.

I had to introduce artificial delay (local_bh_enable) to actually
observe the race.

# Solutions for Known and Unknown Vulnerabilities

[FUZZ TESTING](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/bestorm)
[VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

## Simplified network and application security testing

[### BeSTORM

A black box fuzzer, a method of dynamic application security testing, that uncovers unknown security weaknesses during the product development stage, so fixes can be made before a product is launched. This chaos testing style requires no source code to run and offers more than 250 pre-built protocols and modules or the option for custom protocols.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/bestorm)

[### BeSECURE

A vulnerability assessment and management solution.  It enables your security team to accurately identify known vulnerabilities, using threat intelligence to prioritize them by risk. This allows the team to focus on the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to your infrastructure and cut through the false positives and low-priority weaknesses.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

Together, these solutions strengthen a product’s cybersecurity by adding SecOps into DevOps and through continual, automated vulnerability management and security posture reporting.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
