A crippling flaw in a widely used code library has fatally undermined the security of millions of encryption keys used in some of the highest-stakes settings, including national identity cards, software- and application-signing, and trusted platform modules protecting government and corporate computers.

The weakness allows attackers to calculate the private portion of any vulnerable key using nothing more than the corresponding public portion. Hackers can then use the private key to impersonate key owners, decrypt sensitive data, sneak malicious code into digitally signed software, and bypass protections that prevent accessing or tampering with stolen PCs. The five-year-old flaw is also troubling because it's located in code that complies with two internationally recognized security certification standards that are binding on many governments, contractors, and companies around the world. The code library was developed by German chipmaker Infineon and has been generating weak keys since 2012 at the latest.

The flaw is the one Estonia's government obliquely referred to last month when it warned that [750,000 digital IDs issued since 2014 were vulnerable to attack](https://www.politsei.ee/en/nouanded/isikut-toendavad-dokumendid/id-kaardi-ja-mobiil-id-kasutajale.dot). Estonian officials said they were closing the ID card public key database to prevent abuse. On Monday, officials [posted this update](https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/we-told-you-about-a-potential-security-vulnerability-heres-our-update-86e04119b734). Last week, [Microsoft](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/ADV170012), [Google](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/tpm_firmware_update), and [Infineon](https://www.infineon.com/TPM-update) all warned how the weakness can impair the protections built into TPM products that ironically enough are designed to give an additional measure of security to high-targeted individuals and organizations.

## Completely broken

"In public key cryptography, a fundamental property is that public keys really are public—you can give them to anyone without any impact in security," said Graham Steel, CEO of [Cryptosense](https://cryptosense.com/), which makes software for testing encryption security. "In this work, that property is completely broken." He continued:

> It means that if you have a document digitally signed with someone's private key, you can't prove it was really them who signed it. Or if you sent sensitive data encrypted under someone's public key, you can't be sure that only they can read it. You could now go to court and deny that it was you that signed something—there would be no way to prove it, because theoretically, anyone could have worked out your private key.

Both Steel and Petr Svenda, one of the researchers who discovered the faulty library, also warned the flaw has, or at least had, the potential to create problems for elections in countries where vulnerable cards are used. While actual voter fraud would be difficult to carry out, particularly on a scale needed to sway elections, "just the possibility (although impractical) is troubling as it is support for various fake news or conspiracy theories," Svenda, who is a professor at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, told Ars. Invoking the [prolific leakers of classified National Security Agency material](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/nsa-leaking-shadow-brokers-just-dumped-its-most-damaging-release-yet/), Steel added: "Imagine a Shadowbrokers-like organization posts just a couple of private keys on the Internet and claims to have used the technique to break many more."

The flaw is the subject of a research paper titled *The Return of Coppersmith's Attack: Practical Factorization of Widely Used RSA Moduli*, which will be presented on November 2 at the [ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2017/). The vulnerability was discovered by Slovak and Czech researchers from Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, Enigma Bridge in Cambridge, UK, and Ca' Foscari University in Italy. To give people time to change keys, the paper describing the factorization method isn't being published until it's presented at the conference.

The flaw resides in the Infineon-developed [RSA Library version v1.02.013](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/0782V2a_pdf.pdf), specifically within an algorithm it implements for RSA primes generation. The library allows people to generate keys with smartcards rather than with general-purpose computers, which are easier to infect with malware and hence aren't suitable for high-security uses. The library runs on hardware Infineon sells to a wide range of manufacturers using Infineon smartcard chips and TPMs. The manufacturers, in turn, sell the wares to other device makers or end users. The flaw affects only [keys generated with the RSA algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29), and then only when they were generated on a smartcard or other embedded device that uses the Infineon library.

To boost performance, the Infineon library constructs the keys' underlying prime numbers in a way that makes the keys prone to a [process known as factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization), which exposes the secret numbers underpinning their security. When generated properly, an RSA key with 2048 bits should require several quadrillion years—or hundreds of thousands of times the age of the universe—to be factorized with a general-purpose computer. Factorizing a 2048-bit RSA key generated with the faulty Infineon library, by contrast, takes a maximum of 100 years, and on average only half that. Keys with 1024 bits take a maximum of only three months.

The factorization can be dramatically accelerated by spreading the load onto multiple computers. While costs and times vary for each vulnerable key, the worst case for a 2048-bit one would require no more than 17 days and $40,300 using a 1,000-instance machine on Amazon Web Service and $76 and 45 minutes to factorize an affected 1024-bit key. On average, it would require half the cost and time to factorize the affected keys. All that's required is passing the public key through an extension of what's known as [Coppersmith's Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_Attack).

While all keys generated with the library are much weaker than they should be, it's not currently practical to factorize all of them. For example, 3072-bit and 4096-bit keys aren't practically factorable. But oddly enough, the theoretically stronger, longer 4096-bit key is much weaker than the 3072-bit key and may fall within the reach of a practical (although costly) factorization if the researchers' method improves.

To spare time and cost, attackers can first test a public key to see if it's vulnerable to the attack. The test is inexpensive, requires less than 1 millisecond, and its creators believe it produces practically zero false positives and zero false negatives. The fingerprinting allows attackers to expend effort only on keys that are practically factorizable. The researchers have already used the method successfully to identify weak keys, and they have provided a [tool here](https://keychest.net/roca) to test if a given key was generated using the faulty library. A blog post with more details is [here](https://roca.crocs.fi.muni.cz/).

## In search of vulnerable keys

The researchers examined keys used in electronic identity cards issued by four countries and quickly found two—Estonia and Slovakia—were issuing documents with fingerprinted keys, both of which were 2048 bits in length, making them practically factorizable. Estonia has disclosed the flaw in what it said were 750,000 of the cards issued since 2014. Ars checked the key used in an [e-residency card Ars Senior Business Editor Cyrus Farivar obtained in 2015](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/im-now-an-estonian-e-resident-but-i-still-dont-know-what-to-do-with-it/), and it came back as factorizable.

While it has closed its public key database, Estonian government officials have also [announced plans to rotate all keys to a format that's not vulnerable](https://www.ria.ee/en/id-cards-affected-by-the-security-risk-can-be-renewed-from-november.html), starting in November. The status of Slovakia's system isn't immediately clear. With two of the four countries checked testing positive for fingerprinted keys, a more exhaustive search is likely to identify many more nations issuing cards with factorizable keys.

Next, the researchers examined a sampling of 41 different laptop models that used trusted platform modules. They found vulnerable TPMs from Infineon in 10 of them. The vulnerability is especially acute for TPM version 1.2, because the keys it uses to control Microsoft's BitLocker hard-disk encryption are factorizable. That means anyone who steals or finds an affected computer could bypass the encryption protecting the hard drive and boot sequence. TPM version 2.0 doesn't use factorizable keys for BitLocker, although RSA keys generated for other purposes remain affected. Infineon has issued a firmware update that patches the library vulnerability, and downstream affected TPM manufacturers are in the process of releasing one as well.

The researchers also scanned the Internet for fingerprinted keys and quickly found hits in a variety of surprising places. They found 447 fingerprinted keys—237 of them factorizable—used to sign GitHub submissions, some for very popular software packages. GitHub has since been notified of the fingerprinted keys and is in the process of getting users to change them.

The researchers also found 2,892 PGP keys used for encrypted e-mail, 956 of which were factorizable. The researchers speculated that the majority of the PGP keys were generated using the Yubikey 4, which allows owners to use the faulty library to create on-chip RSA keys. Other functions of the USB device, including [U2F authentication](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/this-low-cost-device-may-be-the-worlds-best-hope-against-account-takeovers/), remain unaffected. Yubico has more details [here](https://www.yubico.com/keycheck/).

The researchers went on to find 15 factorizable keys used for TLS. Strangely, almost all of them contain the string "SCADA" in the common name field. That raised the possibility the certificates are being used by an organization involved in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition, which uses computers to control dams, electric substations, and other industrial equipment. All 15 fingerprinted keys have a characteristic involving their prime numbers that is outside the range of what's produced by the faulty Infineon library, raising the possibility there was a modification of it that hasn't yet been documented.

This is the second time in four years that a major crypto flaw has been found hitting a crypto scheme that has passed rigorous certification tests. In 2013, a different set of researchers unearthed flaws in Taiwan's secure digital ID system that would [allow attackers to impersonate some citizens](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/fatal-crypto-flaw-in-some-government-certified-smartcards-makes-forgery-a-snap/). Like the flawed Infineon library, the underlying cryptography in the Taiwanese digital ID was advertised as having passed the [FIPS 140-2 Level 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2#Level_2) and the [Common Criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria) standards. Both certifications are managed by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov/index.html). Both certifications are often mandatory for certain uses inside government agencies, contractors, and others. In the Taiwanese case, the cards weren't configured properly by the vendor prior to shipping, a condition that meant they weren't tested by NIST.

The researchers who uncovered the Infineon library flaw questioned whether the secrecy required by some of the certification process played a role. They wrote:

> Our work highlights the dangers of keeping the design secret and the implementation closed-source, even if both are thoroughly analyzed and certified by experts. The lack of public information causes a delay in the discovery of flaws (and hinders the process of checking for them), thereby increasing the number of already deployed and affected devices at the time of detection.

All told, the researchers estimate that Infineon's faulty library may have generated tens of millions of RSA keys in the five or so years it has been commercially available. A good many of them are practically factorizable, but even those that are not are considerably more vulnerable to factorization than federal standards and common-sense security guidelines dictate. RSA keys generated with OpenSSL, PGP-compliant programs, or similar computer programs aren't affected. People who have relied on smartcards or embedded devices for cryptographic functions should test their RSA keys using the [researchers' fingerprinting tool](https://keychest.net/roca). In the event the keys test positive, people should revoke them as soon as possible and generate new ones. Keys using Elliptic Curve Cryptography and other non-RSA methods aren't affected.

It's going to take a while for people to identify all vulnerable keys. They should start by replacing those that are known to be practically factorizable, but eventually all RSA keys generated by the flawed library should go. Cryptographers and engineers within NIST and other standards organizations should also use the failure to learn how to improve their high-security certifications processes.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears.

* # ****Security advisory YSA-2017-01****

  ## Security advisory **YSA-2017-01**  – Infineon weak RSA key generation

  Published date: **2017-10-16**

  Tracking IDs: **YSA-2017-01**

  CVE: **[CVE-2017-15361](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15361)**

  **Background**

  Infineon Technologies, one of Yubico’s secure element vendors, informed us of a [security issue](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/rsa-update/) in their firmware cryptographic libraries. The issue weakens the strength of on-chip RSA key generation and affects some use cases for the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smart card and OpenPGP functionality of the YubiKey 4 platform.

  Other functions of the YubiKey 4, including PIV Smart Cards with ECC keys, FIDO U2F, Yubico OTP, and OATH functions, are not affected. YubiKey NEO and FIDO U2F Security Key are not impacted.

  We have created a [dedicated customer portal](https://www.yubico.com/keycheck) to provide additional information to help customers determine if they are affected and to provide mitigation recommendations.

  **Summary of the issue**

  The Infineon RSA key generation issue was [discovered](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17) by an independent team of researchers from the University of Masaryk in the Czech Republic. The researchers found a method to identify mathematical weaknesses of particular algorithms for prime number generation.The method allows an attacker who only has the public portion of an RSA key pair generated on the secure element to compute the private key faster than the current state of the art attack.

  Infineon confirms that the RSA key generation implemented in one of their cryptographic libraries is affected. The root cause of the issue lies within the cryptographic software library, not in the secure element itself – the symmetric and asymmetric hardware co-processors are not affected.

  **Solution**

  To ensure the YubiKey 4 offers strong security for all functions, Yubico switched to a different, broadly scrutinized and deployed key generation function. All YubiKey 4 products shipped by Yubico after June 6, 2017 (version 4.3.5 or higher) use this new implementation. The new implementation has been vetted by the security researchers who discovered the original issue as well as by professional security auditors.

  **Recommendation**

  Affected customers may find options for how to address this issue on the [dedicated customer portal](https://www.yubico.com/keycheck).

  **Mitigation**

  For users of the PIV smart card feature who have previously generated private RSA keys on the YubiKey 4 (version 4.2.6 – 4.3.4), we recommend either regenerating private keys using ECC algorithms, or if RSA keys are required, regenerating keys off the YubiKey 4 and loading them onto the YubiKey 4.

  For users of OpenPGP who have previously generated private RSA keys on the YubiKey 4 (version 4.2.6 – 4.3.4) we recommend regenerating private keys off the YubiKey 4 and loading the new keys onto the YubiKey 4.

  For more detailed information please refer to the Yubico Mitigation Recommendations accessible on the [dedicated customer portal](https://www.yubico.com/keycheck).

  **Timeline**

  | 2017/05/12 | Infineon Technologies informed Yubico, under strict [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf) restrictions, of the issue discovered in an Infineon cryptographic library. |
  | --- | --- |
  | 2017/06/06 | Yubico remedied this issue in all shipping YubiKey 4 devices. |
  | 2017/06/06 – 2017/10/16 | Yubico works with Infineon and the team of researchers from the University of Masaryk to assess potentially impacted services. |
  | 2017/10/16 | The security researchers from the University of Masaryk publish their research and the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure embargo is lifted. Yubico issues this Security Advisory to customers, offering mitigation recommendations and a [key replacement program](https://www.yubico.com/keycheck) for affected customers. |

**<TLDR>**

**Release date: 16th October, 2017**

A newly discovered vulnerability in generation of RSA keys used by a software library adopted in cryptographic smartcards, security tokens and other secure hardware chips manufactured by Infineon Technologies AG allows for a practical factorization attack, in which the attacker computes the private part of an RSA key. The attack is feasible for commonly used key lengths, including 1024 and 2048 bits, and affects chips manufactured as early as 2012, that are now commonplace. Assess your keys now with the provided  [offline and online detection tools](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds "https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds") and contact your vendor if you are affected. Major vendors including Microsoft, Google, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu already released the software updates and guidelines for a mitigation. Full details including the factorization method were released at the  [ACM CCS conference](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2017/ "https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2017/") as 'The Return of Coppersmith's Attack: Practical Factorization of Widely Used RSA Moduli' (ROCA) research paper.

**</TLDR>**

## Description of the vulnerability

A security vulnerability was found in the implementation of RSA keypair generation in a cryptographic library used in a wide range of cryptographic chips produced by Infineon Technologies AG. The product is also integrated in authentication, signature and encryption tokens of other vendors and chips used for Trusted Boot of operating systems. The vulnerability is present in NIST FIPS 140-2 and CC EAL 5+ certified devices since at least the year 2012.
[![](/_media/public/papers/roca_impact.png?w=400&tok=973b60)](/_detail/public/papers/roca_impact.png?id=public%3Apapers%3Arsa_ccs17 "public:papers:roca_impact.png")

The algorithmic vulnerability is characterized by a specific structure of the generated RSA primes, which makes factorization of commonly used key lengths including 1024 and 2048 bits practically possible. Only the knowledge of a public key is necessary and no physical access to the vulnerable device is required. The vulnerability does NOT depend on a weak or a faulty random number generator - all RSA keys generated by a vulnerable chip are impacted. The attack was practically verified for several randomly selected 1024-bit RSA keys and for several selected 2048-bit keys.

The specific structure of the primes in question allows for a fast detection of vulnerable keys, even in very large datasets. This property is useful for mitigation (users can assess own keys for vulnerability), but also for potential attackers (keys vulnerable to factorization can be pre-selected, without undergoing time-consuming factorization attempts).
The worst cases for the factorization of 1024 and 2048-bit keys are less than 3 CPU-months and 100 CPU-years, respectively, on a single core of a common recent CPU, while the expected time is half of that of the worst case. The factorization can be easily parallelized on multiple CPUs. Where *k* CPUs are available, the wall time required for the attack will be reduced *k-times* - allowing for practical factorization in order of hours or days. The worst-case price of the factorization on an Amazon AWS c4 computation instance is $76 for the 1024-bit key and about $40,000 for the 2048-bit key.

The difficulty of the factorization attack is not the same for all key lengths and is NOT strictly increasing (some longer keys may take less time to factorize than other shorter ones). The following key length ranges are now considered practically factorizable (time complexity between hours to 1000 CPU years at maximum): 512 to 704 bits, 992 to 1216 bits and 1984 to 2144 bits. Note that 4096-bit RSA key is not practically factorizable now, but may become so, if the attack is improved.

The time complexity and cost for the selected key lengths (Intel E5-2650 v3@3GHz Q2/2014):

* 512 bit RSA keys - 2 CPU hours (the cost of $0.06);
* 1024 bit RSA keys – 97 CPU days (the cost of $40-$80);
* 2048 bit RSA keys – 140.8 CPU years, (the cost of $20,000 - $40,000).

The vulnerability was found by a close inspection of a large number of RSA keys generated and exported from the manufacturer smartcards by researchers at CRoCS laboratory, Masaryk University, Enigma Bridge and Ca' Foscari University. The full results were presented at an academic ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS '17) in November 2017.

The vulnerability was disclosed to Infineon Technologies AG, following the responsible disclosure principle, in the first week of February with agreement of an 8 month period before a public disclosure. We cooperated with the manufacturer and other affected parties to help evaluate and mitigate this vulnerability during this period. Major vendors including Microsoft, Google, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu already released the software updates and guidelines for a mitigation. We are now notifying general public and releasing tools for assessment of the individual keys.

## Impact

A remote attacker can compute an RSA private key from the value of a public key. The private key can be misused for impersonation of a legitimate owner, decryption of sensitive messages, forgery of signatures (such as for software releases) and other related attacks.

The actual impact of the vulnerability depends on the usage scenario, availability of the public keys and the lengths of keys used. We found and analyzed vulnerable keys in various domains including electronic citizen documents, authentication tokens, trusted boot devices, software package signing, TLS/HTTPS keys and PGP. The currently confirmed number of vulnerable keys found is about 760,000 but possibly up to two to three magnitudes more are vulnerable. The details will be presented in two weeks at the ACM CCS conference.

The vulnerable chips are pervasive and not necessarily sold directly by Infineon Technologies AG, as the chips can be embedded inside devices of other manufacturers.

## Detection tools, mitigation and workarounds

The first step is to detect if you use a chip with the vulnerable library. As the vulnerability is present in the on-chip software library and not limited just to a particular batch of hardware, the only reliable way is to generate an RSA keypair on the device and test the public key by the provided tools (see below). It is recommended to test also the keys already in use. We believe the tools are very accurate - it is highly unlikely that a secure key would be flagged, as well as that a vulnerable key would be missed.

We provide the following tools:

* **Offline testers**: Python/Java/C++ applications and tutorials ([https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca](https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca "https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca")). We release all offline tools under the MIT license so it can be embedded into other testing applications and services.
* **Online testers**: Upload public key to [https://keychest.net/roca](https://keychest.net/roca "https://keychest.net/roca") or [https://keytester.cryptosense.com](https://keytester.cryptosense.com "https://keytester.cryptosense.com") to test your key.
* **Email S-MIME/PGP tester**: Send a signed email to roca@keychest.net to obtain an automatic email response with the analysis of the signing key vulnerability.

If a vulnerable key is found, then you should contact your device vendor for further advice.

The following general advices may apply:

* Apply the software update if available.
* Replace the device with one without the vulnerable library.
* Generate a secure RSA keypair outside the device (e.g., via the OpenSSL library) and import it to the device. We are not aware of any vulnerability in connection with the actual use of the key, only the generation phase has a confirmed vulnerability.
* Use other cryptographic algorithm (e.g., ECC) instead of RSA on affected devices.
* Apply additional risk management within your environment, if the RSA key in use is detected as vulnerable.
* Use key lengths which are not currently impacted (e.g., 3936 bits) by our factorization method. Be aware: use this specific mitigation only as a last resort, as the attack may be improved.

## Q&A

**Q:** Is the RSA algorithm insecure in general after the disclosure of this vulnerability?

**A:** No. If the RSA primes are generated as a truly random numbers, our method cannot be applied. For example, keys generated by the OpenSSL library are NOT affected.

**Q:** How can I be sure that my keys are not affected?

**A:** Run one of the  [provided detection tools](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds "https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds"). We believe that the tool has practically no false positives (if a key is flagged as vulnerable, it is vulnerable) and no false negatives (if a key is not detected as vulnerable, it is safe against our attack).

**Q:** How can I mitigate the vulnerability?

**A:** Contact your vendor and ask for help, apply the patch if available.

**Q:** There was a recent (10th of October) security advisory regarding Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) by Microsoft, Google and other vendors. Is this connected to the vulnerability announced in this disclosure?

A: Yes, this is the direct result of the vulnerability found as the affected devices are using TPMs with the vulnerable library.

**Q:** Are ECC keys generated on the affected chips vulnerable?

**A:** No. We found no vulnerability in the ECC key generation of the vulnerable library.

**Q:** The Coppershmith's attack was already used to factorize keys from cryptographic smartcards. Is this an instance of the same vulnerability?

**A:** No, this one is different. Daniel J. Bernstein, Yun-An Chang, Chen-Mou Cheng, Li-Ping Chou, Nadia Heninger, Tanja Lange and Nicko van Someren in 2013 devised a method to exploit flawed random number generator in Taiwanese citizen cards, present due to a manufacturing defect in some of the cards [https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf](https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf "https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf"). This new vulnerability applies to all chips equipped with the vulnerable library.

**Q:** How was the vulnerability found?

**A:** We analyzed the statistical properties of a large number of RSA keys generated and extracted from various smartcards during the previous research work published at USENIX Security 2016 conference ([https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/svenda](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/svenda "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/svenda")). No reverse engineering of the chip or the library was performed.

**Q:** Are FIDO U2F authentication tokens affected?

**A:** No. The U2F specifications only allow for ECC-based authentication.

## AQtive Guard is Built on Three Foundational Pillars

### [DISCOVER](https://www.sandboxaq.com/solutions/security/discover)

AQtive Guard provides a first-of-its-kind, 360-degree view of your cryptography using three types of analyzers:

* **Network Analyzer** captures network traffic and identifies cryptography used to protect data in transit.
* **Application Analyzer** detects and records all calls to cryptographic libraries made by an application at run time, identifying vulnerabilities and policy breaches.
* **Filesystem Analyzer** scans files to find and parse cryptographic objects in data at rest.Â

### MANAGE

The Control Centeris the core of SandboxAQ AQtive Guard. It provides a comprehensive, actionable dashboard view of your cryptographic infrastructure, including artifacts, libraries, algorithms, and protocols. The Control Center also includes benchmarking tools to monitor cryptographic performance.Â

* Analyze your cryptographic inventory.
* Cross-reference cryptographic use in your network, applications, and filesystems.

* Identify vulnerabilities and cryptographic algorithms that do not adhere to policies such as FIPS 140-2, PCI DSS, or your own internal requirements.
* Integrate cryptographic inventory, analysis, and alerting into your CI/CD and DevOps toolchains for application tracing and monitoring.
* Enable remediation by integrating with JIRA, GitHub, IDE, and other DevOps issue tracking tools.
* Monitor cryptographic performance.
### [REMEDIATE](https://www.sandboxaq.com/solutions/security/remediate)

Available for select preview partners, AQtive Guard will enable remediation and supervised enforcement to respond to off-policy violations. AQtive Guard will allow immediate response to vulnerabilities and out-of-policy algorithms, and remediate with real-time cryptographic algorithm and/or protocol switching, without having to re-architecture your IT, minimizing costs and time.

* Transition your IT infrastructure to agile cryptography with supervised automation to reduce risks.

* Easily adhere to new cryptographic requirements and switch between them without requiring additional development or maintenance.
* Integrate and operationalize cryptography for deployment.
* Remediate and enforce off-policy algorithms.
* Achieve full sovereignty over your cryptography.

#### SandboxAQ AQtive Guard

Cryptography is the foundation of data protection. However, it is often opaque and hard-coded in systems, making it difficult to eliminate vulnerabilities, challenging to show compliance, and complex to implement upgrades. AQtive Guard is here to help. Developed by a world-class team of cryptographers and software engineers, AQtive Guard offers a solution for cryptographic migration, every step of the way.

[Request an AQtive Guard demo](https://go.sandboxaq.com/SecuritySuiteDemo2023.html)![What to Expect from Quantum Tech](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622a3cfaa89636b753810f04/65807498c1aa583978ba9d01_video-security-suite-overview.jpg)

The emergence of large, fault-tolerant quantum computers poses a significant threat to current public-key cryptography, leaving sensitive data and systems vulnerable to attacks. SandboxAQ was selected by the NIST's National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence for its [Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography project](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/crypto-agility-considerations-migrating-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms), which partners with industry to help the government develop best practices to transition from current public-key cryptography to post-quantum cryptography algorithms. Weâve also formed strategic alliances with leading systems integrators Accenture, Deloitte and EY to help enterprise customers securely transition to the quantum era.

## Information on software update of RSA key generation function

Recently, a research team developed advanced mathematical methods to exploit the characteristics of acceleration algorithms for prime number finding, which are common practice today for RSA key generation.

In this context, the team informed Infineon upfront, in the scope of responsible disclosure that selected Infineon products can be affected under a specific combination of preconditions: First, the acceleration algorithm must be used. Second, cryptographic keys have to be generated on a card or token, which uses this algorithm. This function is seldom used, but important. Products that can be affected are typically the TPM (Trusted Platform Modules), e.g. used in professional notebooks, and smart cards for signature applications with self-generated keys. The chip hardware (symmetric and asymmetric co-processors) is not affected.

Infineon immediately informed its related customers and offered mitigation paths. In parallel, the affected software function was updated in close co-operation with the research team, customers and the German certification body.

# ROCA Vulnerability Test Suite

### Information and tools to test RSA keys for the ROCA vulnerability

The ROCA vulnerability has been discovered by researchers at [Masaryk University (Brno, Czech Republic)](https://roca.crocs.fi.muni.cz). KeyChest has close links to the researchers
so it integrated a ROCA detection tool within its test suite. It allows users of affected
products to verify security of their encryption keys.

This test suite provides information about the ROCA vulnerability, which is caused by
an error in RSA key generation in Infineon security chips. These computer chips are
used in a number of products and applications as detailed in the ROCA vulnerability
summary below.

You can use this test suit to check your RSA keys in a text form, by uploading a keystore
in one of the supported types, or by sending an email with a digital signature (S/MIME)
or your PGP key to an email responder. Use the form below to select the most suitable
method.

If you experience difficulties or errors on this page, please let us know via our
[support system](https://keychest.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new).

**Privacy notice:** Any data you provide on this page is deleted as soon
as we complete a requested test. We do not keep your keys or any other data generated
during testing.

**Update (20th October 2017)**: Gemalto IDPrime .NET smart cards have been generating weak RSA
keys since 2008 or earlier - [ROCA
vulnerability impact on Gemalto IDPrime .NET smart cards](https://magicofsecurity.com/roca-vulnerability-impact-on-gemalto-idprime-net-smart-cards/).

**Update (24th October 2017)**: [Researchers
from Masaryk University](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/) requested changes to texts explaining test results. We are
updating these to provide more accurate guidance. Please visit their web page at [ROCA: Vulnerable RSA generation](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17) for a detailed
description of the impact of the ROCA vulnerability.

**Update (14th November 2017)**: The Spanish government has said it would "deactivate" all
electronic ID-card (DNIe) certificates issued after May 2015. It hasn't happened yet.
The official statement in Spanish is at
["Direccion General de la Policia - DNI y Pasaporte" portal](https://www.dnielectronico.es/PortalDNIe/).

This service is provided by KeyChest Ltd.
It uses [the official ROCA detection tool](https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca).

As you're here, try our KeyChest - expiry monitoring service for web encryption. It is free
for personal use and up to 100 endpoints. It uses Certificate Transparency databases with
our own look-up tables to discover new certificates within minutes.

## Infineon RSA library does not properly generate RSA key pairs

#### Vulnerability Note VU#307015

Original Release Date: 2017-10-16 | Last Revised: 2017-11-08

---

### Overview

The Infineon RSA library version 1.02.013 does not properly generate RSA key pairs, which may allow an attacker to recover the RSA private key corresponding to an RSA public key generated by this library. This vulnerability is often cited as "ROCA" in the media.

### Description

| [**CWE-310**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html)**:** **Cryptographic Issues -**CVE-2017-15361  The Infineon RSA library version 1.02.013 does not properly generate RSA key pairs. As a result, the keyspace required for a brute force search is lessened such that it is feasible to factorize keys under at least 2048 bits and obtain the RSA private key. The attacker needs only access to the victim's RSA public key generated by this library in order to calculate the private key.Note that only RSA key generation is impacted. ECC is unaffected. RSA keys generated by other devices/libraries may also be used safely with this library.Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) or smartcards may use this RSA library in their products. Infineon has provided a partial list of impacted vendors in a [security advisory](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/tpm-update/?redirId=59160). Please see our list of impacted vendors below.A [research paper](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/_media/public/papers/nemec_roca_ccs17_preprint.pdf) with more detail was presented at the ACM CCS conference in November 2017. Also in early November 2017, an independent research team produced a [more successful attack](https://blog.cr.yp.to/20171105-infineon.html) against this flaw based on summary details from the original paper. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able recover the RSA private key from a victim's public key, if it was generated by the Infineon RSA library. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Check with your device manufacturer for information on firmware updates. A partial list of affected vendors is below.Alternatively, affected users may use the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Replace the device**Consider replacing the vulnerable device with a non-impacted device.**Generate a new RSA or ECC key pair**ECC keys are not impacted by this vulnerability. Affected users should consider generating a new ECC key pair to replace the vulnerable RSA key pair.Alternatively, if RSA keys are required, affected users may generate an RSA key pair using different method (e.g., OpenSSL) and then use the new secure RSA key pair with the old device. Only RSA key generation is impacted, not use of secure keys.4096-bit RSA keys generated by the Infineon library are not known to be practically factorizable at current publication time, but affected users should not rely on this property for the long-term future. |

reduce the risk:

• Only RSA key pairs generated by the TPM are affected by this vulnerability. Rekeying of the TPM
by using other cryptograhpic algorithms (e.g. ECC), using 3936-bit RSA keys, or importing RSA
keys to the TPM that are generated by other systems help mitigate the security vulnerability.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Industrial PCs are the PC hardware platform for PC-based Automation from Siemens.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-15361

The Inﬁneon RSA library in Inﬁneon Trusted Platform Module (TPM) ﬁrmware creates RSA keys which
might be susceptible to the ROCA attack, possibly exposing the private key of a RSA key pair.

# ROCA vulnerability impact on Gemalto IDPrime .NET smart cards

[20th October 2017](https://magicofsecurity.com/roca-vulnerability-impact-on-gemalto-idprime-net-smart-cards/) [Dan Cvrcek](https://magicofsecurity.com/author/dan/) [5 Comments](https://magicofsecurity.com/roca-vulnerability-impact-on-gemalto-idprime-net-smart-cards/#disqus_thread)

print
We have reasonable grounds to believe that all **Gemalto IDPrime .NET** smart cards generate weak RSA keys vulnerable to the recently published ROCA vulnerability ([CVE-2017-15361](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15361), [VU#307015](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307015)). Gemalto stopped selling these cards in September 2017, but there are large numbers of cards still in use in corporate environments. Their primary use is in enterprise PKI systems for secure email, VPN access, and so on.
The ROCA vulnerability does NOT seem to affect Gemalto IDPrime MD cards. We have also NO reason to suspect [the ROCA vulnerability](https://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2017/10/crypto-failure-cripples-millions-of-high-security-keys-750k-estonian-ids/) to affect Protiva PIV smart cards, although we couldn’t test any of these.

We have collected a number of reports of weak keys generated by cards manufactured between 2008 and 2017 over this week. All reports so far confirm RSA keys affected by the ROCA vulnerability.

As first indications suggest a better proof of the vulnerability may be required due to the potential impact on their users, we have generated a short RSA key (512 bits). Despite its short length, it verifies the validity of our assumption that the available key testing tools are accurate. While this key length is not acceptable for any practical use, breaking these RSA keys still requires several gigabytes of disk space and days of processing on a desktop computer.

We asked the team from Masaryk University to attempt the factorization of this key. They completed the actual factorization, using a low cost virtual machine in less than 20 minutes, fully in line with the theoretical estimate of less than 2 hours. (Update: another key took 3 minutes on a laptop.)

The checker available online (<https://keychest.net/roca>) showed the key as vulnerable, and the toolkit used by Masaryk university was identical they used to verify ROCA vulnerability previously.

Suggested actions:

* Follow updates from Gemalto and any advise it will provide to its customers.
* Initiate your internal security incident plans.
* If your internal assessment concludes that you need to take remediation action, please consider the following notes:

If you use affected smart cards and they generate their RSA keys, you will need to either change the way you generate the keys, the algorithm you use (RSA to Elliptic curve signature), or replace smart cards with secure ones.

There may still be applications using 1,024 bit keys, which can be factored in minutes once the attacker gets respective public keys. (there can be practical reasons for this configuration – e.g., signatures are used for authentication in combination with passwords, generation of longer keys fails and as it times out sessions of web-based applications). The ROCA vulnerability completely changes relevant risk profiles and you’re strongly advised to re-evaluate an impact of this change.

Complete remediation of vulnerable systems where .NET smart cards are used for authentication requires replacement of smart cards, and revocation of all certificates issued for insecure keys. Temporarily, the risk can be managed by increasing the key length (3072 bits) or by shortening the validity of certificates.

If application(s) utilizing .NET smart cards protect documents or messages, where you rely on an ability to verify the content or the origin for a longer period of time, you may also need to implement additional security mechanisms, which can be used to verify the documents haven’t changed since their creation or delivery if there’s a dispute about the content or the origin.

If you already implemented multiple protection mechanisms to increase your resiliency against cyber attacks, you are advised to evaluate the change in your risk exposure and implement appropriate changes to protect your company from any new unacceptable risk.

#### Synopsis

The X.509 certificate chain used by this service contains certificates with RSA keys that may have been improperly generated.
#### Description

At least one of the X.509 certificates sent by the remote host has an RSA key that appears to be generated improperly, most likely by a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) produced by Infineon Technologies.
A third party may be able to recover the private key from the certificate's public key. This may allow an attacker to impersonate an HTTPS website or decrypt SSL/TLS sessions to the remote service.
#### Solution

Upgrade the firmware for all Infineon TPMs and revoke the affected certificates, including any certificates signed by an affected key.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

## 2017.11.05: Reconstructing ROCA: A case study of how quickly an attack can be developed from a limited disclosure. #infineon #roca #rsa

[Authors of this blog post, in alphabetical order:
[Daniel J. Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to/djb.html)
and
[Tanja Lange](https://hyperelliptic.org/tanja).]

Nemec, SÃ½s, Å venda, Klinec, and MatyÃ¡Å¡
[announced](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa%1Fccs17)
on 16 October that
[millions](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/crypto-failure-cripples-millions-of-high-security-keys-750k-estonian-ids/)
of supposedly high-security RSA public keys
from a popular Infineon
[software library](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507040743/https%3A//www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/rsa-update/rsa-background)
("v1.02.013")
were actually vulnerable to low-cost attacks.
Specifically,
Infineon's 1024-bit keys take "less than 3 CPU-months"
to factor "on a single core of a common recent CPU",
and half as much time on average.
Infineon's 2048-bit keys take less than "100 CPU-years" to factor.
On an Intel Haswell running at only 3GHz (similar to Amazon's "c4" cores),
the 2048-bit keys take "140.8 CPU-years" to factor.

The news said
"To give people time to change keys,
the paper describing the factorization method
isn't being published until it's presented at the conference."
The authors of the paper
included in their announcement
only limited information about their factorization method.

We decided to see whether we could reconstruct the attack
from this limited information,
rather than waiting for the paper to be released.
We figured out the main ideas within a day.
Within a week we sent the authors our own attack software,
running even faster than theirs.
We certainly weren't working full time on this during the week.

We emphasize that this work was not independent
of what the paper authors did,
and the fact that we were able to reconstruct the attack so quickly
should not be viewed as criticism of the merits of the paper.
We were starting from some information released by the authors.
What we are saying is that, from a security perspective,
this information was in fact the critical information in the paper.
Here are some questions to think about:

* Presumably, after seeing the 16 October announcement,
  some users managed to replace their RSA signature keys
  before the paper was released.
  Were these users safe against serious attackers on 17 October?
* Did delaying the release of the paper for two weeks make users *think* they were safer than they actually were?
* RSA is used not just for signatures but also for encryption.
  Once a ciphertext has been sent and recorded by an attacker,
  replacing the key doesn't protect the ciphertext.
  What was the impact of the delay on the amount of
  private user data encrypted under weak keys?
* Overall, did delaying the release of the paper *help* security, or *hurt* security?
* The authors notified Infineon at the beginning of February 2017.
  It seems that Infineon negotiated nine months of delay
  before the paper was posted.
  Did this much larger delay *help* security, or *hurt* security?
* ISO maintains a standard for prime generation
  (ISO/IEC 18032:2005)
  that isn't strict enough to prohibit what Infineon was doing.
  ISO wasn't told the attack details,
  and wasn't asked to fix the standard,
  until this month.
  Did this delay *help* security, or *hurt* security?

An
[August 2016 paper](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/_media/public/papers/usenixsec16_1mrsakeys_trfimu_201603.pdf)
by Å venda, Nemec, Sekan, KvaÅ¡ÅovskÃ½,
FormÃ¡nek, KomÃ¡rek, and MatyÃ¡Å¡
had already pointed out that Infineon keys
were visibly non-random; see Table 6 in the paper.
Attackers could already have figured out
the whole attack from these details.
Or attackers could have looked at Infineon keys on their own
and found the same information.
Our best guess is that serious attackers
found the Infineon vulnerability years ago
and have been quietly exploiting it since then.

**Costs of an attack.**
We are deeply concerned by the statement
["Large-scale vote fraud is not conceivable due to the considerable cost and computing power necessary"](https://web.archive.org/web/20171108223524/https%3A//id.ee/index.php?id=38066)
regarding the Estonian ID cards used for e-voting.
This statement appears to be based on the claim that
breaking all 750000 ID cards would cost
[60 billion Euros](https://web.archive.org/web/20171125071811/http%3A//news.err.ee%3A80/631683/survey-attitudes-toward-e-voting-unaffected-by-id-card-security-risk),
which in turn is based on the claim that
breaking one card would cost 80000 Euros.
Actual attack costs are thousands of times lower,
for several reasons:

* **10x improvement:**
  "Large-scale vote fraud" does not require breaking
  *all* of the ID cards;
  10% already buys massive influence.
* **More than 4x improvement:**
  It seems that 80000 EUR was the cost of a preliminary algorithm
  reported by the authors.
  The authors subsequently reported that a faster algorithm
  uses 40000 EUR worst-case
  and, more to the point, 20000 EUR on average.
  We have already beaten this,
  and we expect further research attention
  to produce further improvements.
* **More than 10x improvement:**
  20000 EUR is a cost using *rented* computer equipment.
  Serious attackers reduce costs by an order of magnitude
  by *purchasing* computer equipment.
  Concretely, 20000 EUR buys 20 computers,
  each with 8-core CPUs,
  completing an average factorization in roughly 4 months;
  and the cost of a computer is amortized across
  years of calculations.
* **More than 10x improvement:**
  20000 EUR is a cost using *general-purpose CPUs*.
  There is extensive literature studying
  the cost reductions achievable
  with other types of chips such as GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs.
  Our assessment is that
  this factorization algorithm is reasonably well suited
  to take advantage of such chips.

We are happy to see Estonia finally
[blocking](https://web.archive.org/web/20180525235639/https%3A//medium.com/e-residency-blog/digital-id-cards-will-only-work-with-new-certificates-from-midnight-tonight-6e4db59658b8)
the Infineon keys starting 3 November,
but tremendous damage could already have been done.

**Certification.**
Infineon
[says](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507040743/https%3A//www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/rsa-update/rsa-background)
that its "Fast Prime" function was
"certified by the BSI
(Federal Office for Information Security) in Germany.
No mathematical weaknesses were known,
nor have been discovered during the certification processes."
The Estonian authorities
[say](https://web.archive.org/web/20171108223524/https%3A//id.ee/index.php?id=38066)
that compliance with "security requirements"
has been
"certified by the competent German and French certification bodies".
There are several BSI certifications,
ANSSI certifications, and so on
for security systems that include Infineon's library v1.02.013:
see, e.g., the
[BSI certification report for Infineon Security Controller M7892 B11](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/0782V2a_pdf.pdf)
based on tests by TÃV Informationstechnik GmbH.

It seems that the prime-generation algorithm
used by Infineon was never subjected to public review.
It also seems that this failure
was *encouraged* by the certification process.
As stated in the paper:

> The certification process counter-intuitively "rewards"
> the secrecy of design by additional
> certification "points"
> when an implementation is difficult
> for potential attackers to obtainâthus favoring
> security by obscurity.
> Relevant certification bodies might want to
> reconsider such an approach in favor of
> open implementations and specifications.
> Secrecy may increase the dificulty of spotting a flaw
> (above the capability of some attackers)
> but may also increase the impacts of the flaw
> due to the later discovery thereof.

Did BSI never ask Infineon to justify its prime-generation algorithm?
Or did Infineon supply a justification
with flaws that BSI failed to detect?
Apparently Hanno BÃ¶ck asked BSI for comments on this incident and
[didn't receive an answer](https://web.archive.org/web/20171024151557/https%3A//www.golem.de/news/infineon-bsi-zertifiziert-unsichere-verschluesselung-1710-130716.html).
What is the value of certification
if such weaknesses are not caught?

### The reconstruction process

The rest of this blog post dives into the details
of (1) what information was released
and (2) our process of reconstructing an attack from this information.

**Divisors in residue classes.**
As part of their 16 October announcement,
the paper authors posted a tool for checking whether a key is generated by Infineon's library.
We inspected the source code of the tool
to see that an Infineon key N has a limited set of remainders modulo various small primes.
For example, N is guaranteed to be 1 or 10 modulo 11,
and 1 or 10 or 26 modulo 37,
whereas properly generated RSA keys are equally distributed across 10 different possibilities modulo 11
and 36 different possibilities modulo 37.

The numbers 1, 10, 26 modulo 37 are exactly the powers of 10 modulo 37.
How could Infineon be generating primes p and q so that the product N = pq is a power of 10 modulo 37?
The simplest explanation is that each of p and q
is generated as a power of 10 modulo 37,
forcing the product N = pq to be a power of 10 modulo 37.
Similar comments apply when 37 is replaced by various other possibilities.

Inspecting examples of Infineon primes p and q,
rather than public keys N,
would have immediately shown that this explanation is in fact correct.
The 2016 paper mentioned above
already stated that the primes were limited in the same way as N.
We hadn't seen that paper,
and we weren't looking at any secret keys,
but we were using Occam's Razor to make reasonable guesses.

This type of information about p and q is important
because the literature already explains a polynomial-time algorithm to find
a prime divisor of N in a specified arithmetic progression u, u+v, u+2v, u+3v, etc.,
assuming that gcd{v,N} = 1 and that v â¥ N1/4.
For v â¥ N1/2 this is an easy exercise.
For v â¥ N1/3 this goes back to a classic 1984 paper
["Divisors in residue classes"](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1984-42-165/S0025-5718-1984-0726007-1/S0025-5718-1984-0726007-1.pdf)
by Lenstra.
For v â¥ N1/4 this is a result of Coppersmith, Howgrave-Graham, and Nagaraj,
presented in
[Howgrave-Graham's thesis](https://cr.yp.to/bib/1998/howgrave-graham.pdf) in 1998
and in a paper
["Divisors in residue classes, constructively"](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2008-77-261/S0025-5718-07-02007-8/S0025-5718-07-02007-8.pdf).
The N1/4 is a soft cutoff:
one can go down to N1/4/poly(N), although the time goes up correspondingly.

This isn't a complete discussion of the history.
The underlying algorithmic idea
was developed through a series of papers by many people aiming at various applications;
see the survey paper
["Reducing lattice bases to find small-height values of univariate polynomials"](https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#smallheight)
for more information.
Perhaps the idea should be called "extended linearization" ("XL"),
recognizing its similarity to
a technique introduced by Lazard in 1979
for solving equations in many variables over a field;
the name XL for this technique goes back to a 2000 paper by Courtois, Klimov, Patarin, and Shamir.
But this name isn't standard outside the multivariate context.
People instead typically say that they're using "Coppersmith's method",
even if they're actually using, e.g., Lenstra's algorithm.

Internally,
these algorithms perform lattice-basis reduction.
There are various parameters such as the dimension of the lattice
and the largest power of N that is used in creating the lattice.
Larger lattice dimensions use more time for reduction
but handle smaller values of v.

Nemec, SÃ½s, Å venda, Klinec, and MatyÃ¡Å¡
had announced their paper title as
"The Return of Coppersmith's Attack: Practical Factorization of Widely Used RSA Moduli".
This sounded consistent with the idea
that the primes are in fact known or guessed modulo some v.

**Random powers modulo primes.**
It's normal to generate large random primes
by generating large random integers and testing them for primality.
It's also normal to double the success chance per integer, saving half of the randomness,
by generating large *odd* random integers and testing them for primality.
One can go further in this direction,
for example saving 77% of the original randomness as follows:

* Decide that p mod 2 is 1.
* Choose randomly what p mod 3 will be, either 1 or 2.
* Choose randomly what p mod 5 will be, either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.
* Choose randomly what p mod 7 will be, either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.
* Reconstruct p mod 210 by the "Chinese Remainder Theorem" ("CRT"). There are 2\*4\*6 = 48 different possibilities at this point.
  These are exactly the 48 integers between 0 and 210
  coprime to 210,
  i.e., not divisible by 2 or 3 or 5 or 7.
* Add a large random multiple of 210 to obtain p.
* Check whether p is in fact prime.

One can replace 2\*3\*5\*7 by an even larger product of primes.
Beware that at some point this breaks down:
for example, if the goal is to generate a 1024-bit prime,
then one can't use the product 2\*3\*5\*7\*...\*997 of all primes below 1000.
(This product is nearly 21380,
so p mod the product is almost certainly above 21300.)

There is an extensive literature on generating sequences of random numbers.
Lehmer in 1949
[suggested](https://archive.org/details/proceedings_of_a_second_symposium_on_large-scale_)
generating a sequence of 8-digit random numbers
by multiplying an initial number repeatedly by 23 modulo 108+1.
What would happen if Infineon generated a sequence of possibilities for p mod 11
as, e.g., powers of 2 mod 11?
This isn't inherently a problem: 2 is a generator mod 11,
meaning that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are powers of 2 mod 11.

What would happen if Infineon instead generated a sequence of possibilities for p mod 11
as powers of 10 mod 11?
Suddenly there would be only two possibilities:
the only powers of 10 mod 11 are 1 and 10,
matching what Infineon seemed to be doing.
This could even be a deliberate weakness with plausible deniability:
"Oh, sorry, nobody warned us that 2 mod 11 was okay
and 10 mod 11 wasn't."

We wrote down
[details of our observations so far](20171105-infineon1.txt),
and
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/hyperelliptic/status/920070462247522304)
a hash of the details:

**Random powers modulo products of primes.**
The next day we sent [email to the paper authors](20171105-infineon2.txt)
with the details and also with a simpler guess for what Infineon was doing.
The simpler guess was that,
instead of computing separate powers modulo 3, 5, 7, ...
Infineon was computing a power of a single number g modulo the product L = 2\*3\*5\*7\*...
This would save Infineon the CRT effort,
and would have the same basic effect of guaranteeing that the resulting integers
are coprime to L, i.e., not divisible by any of the primes dividing L.
This would also force all output keys to be 1 or 10 modulo 11
if g happened to be 10 modulo 11.

This guess would also mean that Infineon
was limiting the set of keys it could generate.
Specifically,
a standard number-theory exercise says that,
if L is divisible by two different odd primes,
then it's impossible to find an integer g such that all integers coprime to L are powers of g.
For example, no matter what g you choose,
there are at most 12 different powers of g modulo 210;
recall that CRT was producing 48 different possibilities.

A related algorithm
["GenPrime"](https://www.iacr.org/workshops/ches/ches2006/presentations/Marc%20Joye.pdf)
was published by Joye and Paillier in 2006.
The JoyeâPaillier generator, like Lehmer's generator,
*starts from a new random number r coprime to L*
and then multiplies repeatedly by a constant g modulo L,
obtaining r times a power of g.
This can produce any number modulo L,
and produces only a slight bias in the resulting primes.
The guess was that Infineon was oversimplifying
and generating merely a power of g;
this produces far fewer numbers modulo L.

The authors wrote back promptly,
confirming that this guess was correct
but not revealing more details.

**First attack.**
We were busy with other things
but came back to this reverse-engineering on 20 October.
We downloaded a pile of PGP keys
and extracted the 2048-bit keys that survived all the tests announced by the authors,
presumably Infineon-generated keys.
We tried these keys modulo further small primes,
finding, for example, that N mod 331 was always 1 or 330.
We then tried these keys modulo products of small primes,
for example finding that N mod 2\*11\*37\*97\*331
was always 1, 65537, 4878941, 8942297, 14367385, or 24016035.
These are exactly the powers of 65537 modulo 2\*11\*37\*97\*331.
For comparison,
there were 2 possibilities for N mod 11,
3 for N mod 37,
6 for N mod 97,
and 2 for N mod 331,
so if these possibilities had been independent
then there would have been 72 possibilities for N mod 2\*11\*37\*97\*331.

Further computations were consistent with the guess
that p and q were being generated as powers of 65537 modulo L,
where L was either the product of all primes through 691,
or the product of all primes through 701.

A simple attack strategy at this point
is to try all powers of 65537 modulo L,
and apply one of the "divisors in residue classes" algorithms to each possibility.
L is beyond the N1/4 cutoff mentioned above, even beyond the N1/3 cutoff:
the two possibilities for L are roughly 2960 and 2970,
whereas N1/4 is roughly 2512.

This comparison of sizes shows that knowing p mod L
is much more information than necessary.
One can thus replace L by something smaller.
If p is a power of 65537 modulo L
then it is also a power of 65537 modulo v
for any divisor v of L,
and the "divisors in residue classes" algorithms
efficiently find p from this power if v is above N1/4.

The number of powers to try is the order of 65537 modulo v,
and one can reduce v to save time in trying powers.
(The analysis of orders is similar to the analysis of a standard factorization method,
the "p-1 method".)
On the other hand, as v drops down towards N1/4,
the required lattice dimension increases steeply.
We presumed that L includes 701,
checked the orders and basis-reduction time for some possibilities for v,
and then took v as the product of all primes r through 701
such that the order of 65537 modulo r divides
27\*33\*52\*7\*11\*13\*17\*19\*23.
We wrote an attack script using the
[Sage](https://sagemath.org) computer-algebra system,
and sent
[the script and a description](20171105-infineon3.txt)
by email to the authors.
We [tweeted](https://twitter.com/hashbreaker/status/921550323994517504)
a hash of this email:

> More exploration with @hyperelliptic has now produced working attack code:
> 3f5ba89d705a1059683c4c406dcda87f8af73f37cf0202cc74b875fcc28b3cb6

The authors confirmed that our attack script worked on real Infineon keys.
They also confirmed that L did in fact include 701.
We were already assuming 701 in our script,
and we would have already been sure about it
if we had seen some examples of Infineon secret keys
(for example, by putting some computer time
into factoring some public keys).
Anyway, covering both possibilities in the script wouldn't have been much extra effort.

**Second attack.**
Finally, we put some effort into speeding up our script,
stopping when we had something faster than what the paper authors had announced.
We sent the
[details](20171105-infineon4.txt) by email to the authors
and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/hashbreaker/status/922229745454022656) a hash:

> Yup. Our 2048bit attack using @sagemath is now 5-25% faster than ROCA blog.
> 3fd6a53a3b6362248ac10de4a8108df3c839a7193a96d0991c6675990599d917

The "Yup" here was in response to a
[tweet by Graham Steel](https://twitter.com/graham_steel/status/920177917329625088)
regarding our first tweet:

> I guess that was inevitable...
> will they have a faster version of the attack before the paper is even released?

The biggest speedup from our first version to our second was "chaining".
The authors also helpfully pointed out to us
that the 2016 paper
had observed a narrower range of p and q for Infineon
than what we had been assuming;
this provided an additional speedup.
As noted above,
we see many possibilities for further speedups beyond what we implemented.

# ROCA detection tool

[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/41cced4a85472240fed4b24226fcf3d2b9d5d278af1c8def1e0e82cf5aa537fb/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f63726f63732d6d756e692f726f63612e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572)](https://travis-ci.org/crocs-muni/roca)

This tool is related to [ACM CCS 2017 conference paper #124 Return of the Coppersmith’s Attack: Practical Factorization of Widely Used RSA Moduli](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17).

It enables you to test public RSA keys for a presence of the described vulnerability.

*Update 4.11.2017*: Python 2.7, 3.4+ supported.

*Update 30.10.2017*: The [paper](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/_media/public/papers/nemec_roca_ccs17_preprint.pdf) of the attack is already online,
[ACM version](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3133969).

*Update 30.10.2017*: The discrete logarithm detector is now implemented in the Python and used as a default. It detects the structure
in the primes exploited by the factorizing algorithm.

Currently the tool supports the following key formats:

* X509 Certificate, DER encoded, one per file, `*.der`, `*.crt`
* X509 Certificate, PEM encoded, more per file, `*.pem`
* X509 Certificate Signing Request, PEM encoded, more per file, `*.pem`
* RSA PEM encoded private key, public key, more per file, `*.pem` (has to have correct header `-----BEGIN RSA...`)
* SSH public key, `*.pub`, starting with "ssh-rsa", one per line
* ASC encoded PGP key, `*.pgp`, `*.asc`. More per file, has to have correct header `-----BEGIN PGP...`
* APK android application, `*.apk`
* one modulus per line text file `*.txt`, modulus can be
  a) base64 encoded number, b) hex coded number, c) decimal coded number
* JSON file with moduli, one record per line, record with modulus has
  key "mod" (int, base64, hex, dec encoding supported)
  certificate(s) with key "cert" / array of certificates with key "certs" are supported, base64 encoded DER.
* LDIFF file - LDAP database dump. Any field ending with `;binary::` is attempted to decode as X509 certificate
* Java Key Store file (JKS). Tries empty password & some common, specify more with `--jks-pass-file`
* PKCS7 signature with user certificate

The detection tool is intentionally one-file implementation for easy integration / manipulation.

## False positive

False positive detection rates:

* Moduli detector: 2^-27
* Discrete logarithm detector: 2^-154

Discrete logarithm detector is implemented only in the Python code, used as the default detection method.

Java and C# code ports are unmaintained since the original publication and we don't plan to upgrade these
detectors to the more precise method. However PR are welcome!

## Online checker

<https://keychest.net/roca>

The online checker is using the discrete logarithm detector algorithm.

## Install with pip

Install the detector library + tool with `pip` (installs all dependencies):

```
pip install roca-detect

```

## Local install

Execute in the root folder of the package:

```
pip install --upgrade --find-links=. .

```

## Dependencies

It may be required to install additional dependencies so `pip` can install e.g. cryptography package.

CentOS / RHEL:

```
sudo yum install python-devel python-pip gcc gcc-c++ make automake autoreconf libtool openssl-devel libffi-devel dialog

```

Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev swig

```

## Usage

To print the basic usage:

```
# If installed with pip / manually
roca-detect --help

# Without installation (can miss dependencies)
python roca/detect.py

```

The testing tool accepts multiple file names / directories as the input argument.
It returns the report showing how many files has been fingerprinted (and which are those).

```

## PGP key

In order to test your PGP key you can export it from your email client or download it from the PGP key server such as
<https://pgp.mit.edu/>

You can also use `gpg` command line utility to export your public key:

```
gpg --armor --export your@email.com > mykey.asc
```

## Advanced use case

Detection tool extracts information about the key which can be displayed:

```
roca-detect.py --dump --flatten --indent  ~/.ssh/

```

## TLS/SSL detection

The `roca-detect-tls` detects certificates from remote TLS/SSL ports. Provide a file with a newline-delimited list of `address:port` entries and use that file as input.

Example file: tls\_list.txt

```
github.com:443
google.com:443
internal.example.com:8080

```

Then run:

`roca-detect-tls tls_list.txt`

## Fake moduli

It is possible to generate moduli that passes the moduli fingerprinting test but actually do not contain structure
the factorization algorithm is using. Dlog moduli test do not mark those as positive.

## Advanced installation methods

### Virtual environment

It is usually recommended to create a new python virtual environment for the project:

```
virtualenv ~/pyenv
source ~/pyenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade --find-links=. .

```

### Separate Python 2.7.13

We tested tool with Python 2.7.13 and it works (see Travis for more info).
We have reports saying lower versions (<=2.6) do not work properly so we highly recommend using up to date Python 2.7

Use `pyenv` to install a new Python version locally if you cannot / don't want to update system Python.

It internally downloads Python sources and installs it to `~/.pyenv`.

```
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
pyenv install 2.7.13
pyenv local 2.7.13

```

### Python 3

Detection tools works also with Python 3.4+

### Docker container

Run via Docker container to avoid environment inconsistency. Dockerfile source can be audited at <https://hub.docker.com/r/unnawut/roca-detect/>.

```
docker run --rm -v /path/to/your/keys:/keys --network none unnawut/roca-detect

```

Make sure to use `--rm` and `--network none` flags to disable container's network connection and delete the container after running.

## Licensing

Code is licensed under permissive MIT license.

As there were requests on dual licensing under Apache 2.0 license (due to some doubts on compatibility) we are licensing
the code also under Apache 2.0 license.

Pick license that suits you better, either MIT or Apache 2.0.

**<TLDR>**

**Release date: 16th October, 2017**

A newly discovered vulnerability in generation of RSA keys used by a software library adopted in cryptographic smartcards, security tokens and other secure hardware chips manufactured by Infineon Technologies AG allows for a practical factorization attack, in which the attacker computes the private part of an RSA key. The attack is feasible for commonly used key lengths, including 1024 and 2048 bits, and affects chips manufactured as early as 2012, that are now commonplace. Assess your keys now with the provided  [offline and online detection tools](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds "https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds") and contact your vendor if you are affected. Major vendors including Microsoft, Google, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu already released the software updates and guidelines for a mitigation. Full details including the factorization method were released at the  [ACM CCS conference](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2017/ "https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2017/") as 'The Return of Coppersmith's Attack: Practical Factorization of Widely Used RSA Moduli' (ROCA) research paper.

**</TLDR>**

## Description of the vulnerability

A security vulnerability was found in the implementation of RSA keypair generation in a cryptographic library used in a wide range of cryptographic chips produced by Infineon Technologies AG. The product is also integrated in authentication, signature and encryption tokens of other vendors and chips used for Trusted Boot of operating systems. The vulnerability is present in NIST FIPS 140-2 and CC EAL 5+ certified devices since at least the year 2012.
[![](/_media/public/papers/roca_impact.png?w=400&tok=973b60)](/_detail/public/papers/roca_impact.png?id=public%3Apapers%3Arsa_ccs17 "public:papers:roca_impact.png")

The algorithmic vulnerability is characterized by a specific structure of the generated RSA primes, which makes factorization of commonly used key lengths including 1024 and 2048 bits practically possible. Only the knowledge of a public key is necessary and no physical access to the vulnerable device is required. The vulnerability does NOT depend on a weak or a faulty random number generator - all RSA keys generated by a vulnerable chip are impacted. The attack was practically verified for several randomly selected 1024-bit RSA keys and for several selected 2048-bit keys.

The specific structure of the primes in question allows for a fast detection of vulnerable keys, even in very large datasets. This property is useful for mitigation (users can assess own keys for vulnerability), but also for potential attackers (keys vulnerable to factorization can be pre-selected, without undergoing time-consuming factorization attempts).
The worst cases for the factorization of 1024 and 2048-bit keys are less than 3 CPU-months and 100 CPU-years, respectively, on a single core of a common recent CPU, while the expected time is half of that of the worst case. The factorization can be easily parallelized on multiple CPUs. Where *k* CPUs are available, the wall time required for the attack will be reduced *k-times* - allowing for practical factorization in order of hours or days. The worst-case price of the factorization on an Amazon AWS c4 computation instance is $76 for the 1024-bit key and about $40,000 for the 2048-bit key.

The difficulty of the factorization attack is not the same for all key lengths and is NOT strictly increasing (some longer keys may take less time to factorize than other shorter ones). The following key length ranges are now considered practically factorizable (time complexity between hours to 1000 CPU years at maximum): 512 to 704 bits, 992 to 1216 bits and 1984 to 2144 bits. Note that 4096-bit RSA key is not practically factorizable now, but may become so, if the attack is improved.

The time complexity and cost for the selected key lengths (Intel E5-2650 v3@3GHz Q2/2014):

* 512 bit RSA keys - 2 CPU hours (the cost of $0.06);
* 1024 bit RSA keys – 97 CPU days (the cost of $40-$80);
* 2048 bit RSA keys – 140.8 CPU years, (the cost of $20,000 - $40,000).

The vulnerability was found by a close inspection of a large number of RSA keys generated and exported from the manufacturer smartcards by researchers at CRoCS laboratory, Masaryk University, Enigma Bridge and Ca' Foscari University. The full results were presented at an academic ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS '17) in November 2017.

The vulnerability was disclosed to Infineon Technologies AG, following the responsible disclosure principle, in the first week of February with agreement of an 8 month period before a public disclosure. We cooperated with the manufacturer and other affected parties to help evaluate and mitigate this vulnerability during this period. Major vendors including Microsoft, Google, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu already released the software updates and guidelines for a mitigation. We are now notifying general public and releasing tools for assessment of the individual keys.

## Impact

A remote attacker can compute an RSA private key from the value of a public key. The private key can be misused for impersonation of a legitimate owner, decryption of sensitive messages, forgery of signatures (such as for software releases) and other related attacks.

The actual impact of the vulnerability depends on the usage scenario, availability of the public keys and the lengths of keys used. We found and analyzed vulnerable keys in various domains including electronic citizen documents, authentication tokens, trusted boot devices, software package signing, TLS/HTTPS keys and PGP. The currently confirmed number of vulnerable keys found is about 760,000 but possibly up to two to three magnitudes more are vulnerable. The details will be presented in two weeks at the ACM CCS conference.

The vulnerable chips are pervasive and not necessarily sold directly by Infineon Technologies AG, as the chips can be embedded inside devices of other manufacturers.

## Detection tools, mitigation and workarounds

The first step is to detect if you use a chip with the vulnerable library. As the vulnerability is present in the on-chip software library and not limited just to a particular batch of hardware, the only reliable way is to generate an RSA keypair on the device and test the public key by the provided tools (see below). It is recommended to test also the keys already in use. We believe the tools are very accurate - it is highly unlikely that a secure key would be flagged, as well as that a vulnerable key would be missed.

We provide the following tools:

* **Offline testers**: Python/Java/C++ applications and tutorials ([https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca](https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca "https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca")). We release all offline tools under the MIT license so it can be embedded into other testing applications and services.
* **Online testers**: Upload public key to [https://keychest.net/roca](https://keychest.net/roca "https://keychest.net/roca") or [https://keytester.cryptosense.com](https://keytester.cryptosense.com "https://keytester.cryptosense.com") to test your key.
* **Email S-MIME/PGP tester**: Send a signed email to roca@keychest.net to obtain an automatic email response with the analysis of the signing key vulnerability.

If a vulnerable key is found, then you should contact your device vendor for further advice.

The following general advices may apply:

* Apply the software update if available.
* Replace the device with one without the vulnerable library.
* Generate a secure RSA keypair outside the device (e.g., via the OpenSSL library) and import it to the device. We are not aware of any vulnerability in connection with the actual use of the key, only the generation phase has a confirmed vulnerability.
* Use other cryptographic algorithm (e.g., ECC) instead of RSA on affected devices.
* Apply additional risk management within your environment, if the RSA key in use is detected as vulnerable.
* Use key lengths which are not currently impacted (e.g., 3936 bits) by our factorization method. Be aware: use this specific mitigation only as a last resort, as the attack may be improved.
## Team

## Q&A

**Q:** Is the RSA algorithm insecure in general after the disclosure of this vulnerability?

**A:** No. If the RSA primes are generated as a truly random numbers, our method cannot be applied. For example, keys generated by the OpenSSL library are NOT affected.

**Q:** How can I be sure that my keys are not affected?

**A:** Run one of the  [provided detection tools](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds "https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17#detection_tools_mitigation_and_workarounds"). We believe that the tool has practically no false positives (if a key is flagged as vulnerable, it is vulnerable) and no false negatives (if a key is not detected as vulnerable, it is safe against our attack).

**Q:** How can I mitigate the vulnerability?

**A:** Contact your vendor and ask for help, apply the patch if available.

**Q:** There was a recent (10th of October) security advisory regarding Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) by Microsoft, Google and other vendors. Is this connected to the vulnerability announced in this disclosure?

A: Yes, this is the direct result of the vulnerability found as the affected devices are using TPMs with the vulnerable library.

**Q:** Are ECC keys generated on the affected chips vulnerable?

**A:** No. We found no vulnerability in the ECC key generation of the vulnerable library.

**Q:** The Coppershmith's attack was already used to factorize keys from cryptographic smartcards. Is this an instance of the same vulnerability?

**A:** No, this one is different. Daniel J. Bernstein, Yun-An Chang, Chen-Mou Cheng, Li-Ping Chou, Nadia Heninger, Tanja Lange and Nicko van Someren in 2013 devised a method to exploit flawed random number generator in Taiwanese citizen cards, present due to a manufacturing defect in some of the cards [https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf](https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf "https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf"). This new vulnerability applies to all chips equipped with the vulnerable library.

**Q:** How was the vulnerability found?

**A:** We analyzed the statistical properties of a large number of RSA keys generated and extracted from various smartcards during the previous research work published at USENIX Security 2016 conference ([https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/svenda](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/svenda "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/svenda")). No reverse engineering of the chip or the library was performed.

**Q:** Are FIDO U2F authentication tokens affected?

**A:** No. The U2F specifications only allow for ECC-based authentication.

\* What is a TPM?

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an international standard for a security cryptoprocessor that can securely store critical data such as passwords, certificates and encryption keys. TPM is a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware by integrating cryptographic keys into devices and is used for secured crypto processes within computing devices as well as for secured storage of critical data. TPMs are typically used in business laptops, routers and embedded and IoT devices. The technical TPM specification was written by an industry consortium called Trusted Computing Group (TCG).
