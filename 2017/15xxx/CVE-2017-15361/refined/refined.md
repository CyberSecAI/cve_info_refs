Here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2017-15361 from the provided content:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a flaw in the implementation of the RSA key pair generation algorithm within the Infineon RSA library version 1.02.013. This library is used in various Infineon Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).
*   The algorithm produces RSA keys with a specific mathematical structure, making them vulnerable to factorization.
*   The weakness is not due to a faulty random number generator but rather a flawed algorithm for generating the prime numbers that underpin RSA keys.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak RSA key generation:** The Infineon RSA library produces RSA key pairs that are vulnerable to factorization via cryptoanalysis.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to derive the private key from the public key.
*   **Non-random Prime Numbers:** The prime numbers used in key generation have a specific, predictable structure.
*  **Vulnerable Key Lengths:** Keys with 512 to 704 bits, 992 to 1216 bits and 1984 to 2144 bits were identified as practically factorizable. 4096 bit keys are currently not factorizable, but this could change with further improvements in the attack method.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can decrypt data encrypted using the vulnerable public keys.
*   **Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate key owners using the recovered private keys.
*   **Forged Signatures:** Attackers can forge digital signatures, potentially impacting software releases and other signed documents.
*   **Bypass BitLocker:** Stealing or finding a computer with a vulnerable TPM version 1.2 allows bypassing BitLocker hard-disk encryption.
*   **Voter fraud:** While potentially impractical, the possibility of exploiting this flaw in systems used for elections is troubling.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cryptoanalysis:** Attackers can compute the private key from the public key through cryptographic analysis using techniques based on Coppersmith's attack and adapted for this weakness.
*   **Local Access:** Initial description mentions local access, while later descriptions highlight remote access is also possible.
*   **Network access**: The attack can be performed by analyzing the public key, without physical access to the hardware.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Public Key:** The attacker needs access to the public part of an RSA key pair generated by the vulnerable Infineon library. No physical access to the hardware device where the key was generated is needed.
*   **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs sufficient computing power to factorize the RSA keys. Resources can vary from a single PC to an instance in cloud computing providers like Amazon AWS.
*   **Cryptoanalysis Techniques:** The attacker needs to use factorization algorithms to find the private key.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Devices:** The vulnerability affects various types of devices, including:
    *   Intel Server Boards (S2600WT, S2600TP, S2600BP)
    *   Intel NUC Kits
    *   Smartcards, including Estonian e-Residency cards, Gemalto IDPrime .NET cards and cards from other vendors
    *   TPMs (Trusted Platform Modules) from Infineon. Some laptop models used vulnerable TPMs.
    *   YubiKey 4 platform devices
    *   Some TLS certificates with a string "SCADA" within the common name field.
*   **Detection Methods:** Researchers have developed tools to detect vulnerable keys. The tools include:
    *   Offline testers (Python, Java, C++)
    *   Online testers (e.g., keychest.net/roca, keytester.cryptosense.com)
    *   Email testers (by sending a signed email)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Firmware updates for affected TPMs and devices.
    *   Generating keys outside of vulnerable TPMs and importing them.
    *   Using ECC algorithms instead of RSA on affected devices.
    *   Revoking affected RSA keys.
    *   Using key lengths not practically factorizable by current methods, although this is not a long term solution.
*   **Time and Cost of Attack:**
    *   Factorizing a 2048-bit RSA key could take up to 100 CPU-years, but much less with distributed compute.
    *   Using Amazon Web Services, factorizing a 1024-bit key can cost ~$76 and take 45 minutes, while a 2048-bit key can cost $40,300 and take 17 days. The average cost and time would be half of the worst case numbers.
*   **Certification Shortcomings:** The vulnerability highlights the dangers of relying solely on security certifications and the importance of public review of cryptographic algorithms.
*  **Impact on NetApp:** NetApp states none of their products are affected.

In summary, CVE-2017-15361 describes an information disclosure vulnerability stemming from a weak RSA key generation algorithm in Infineon's cryptographic library. This weakness allows for efficient factorization of affected keys, posing a significant risk to a broad range of systems and cryptographic keys. The vulnerability has widespread implications impacting several devices including smartcards, TPMs, and servers. The severity of this vulnerability was considered 'Critical' by NetApp with CVSS v3.0 score of 10.0 (although the CVSS score on the CVE page is 5.9).
