Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the WLAN component, specifically within the Qualcomm code. The root cause is not detailed in the provided text, but it stems from a flaw in the `qcacld-2.0` module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE). This suggests a flaw that can be exploited to run arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, meaning the attacker could potentially gain full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the device. The attacker needs to send a specially crafted file via WLAN to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious file to the device via WLAN. This indicates the attacker would need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, or be able to send a crafted file over WLAN using other methods. The attacker also requires the knowledge to create this specially crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**
