Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The identified vulnerability in Kanboard versions 1.0.46 and earlier stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when handling form data. This allows an authenticated user to perform actions on private projects belonging to other users by manipulating form parameters.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the insufficient validation of project ownership/access permissions within the application's controllers. Specifically, the application relies on user-provided IDs in the request parameters, without adequately ensuring that the user has the right to modify or access the project the ID belongs to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application uses direct object references (project IDs, task IDs, etc.) in the form data without proper authorization checks. This means that an attacker can manipulate these IDs to access or modify resources belonging to another user, bypassing access controls.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application fails to verify if the logged-in user is authorized to perform certain actions on a particular project before executing the corresponding function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can perform the following actions by exploiting this vulnerability:
*   **Unauthorized Access and Modification:**
    *   Edit the name, email, identifier, and description of private projects.
    *   Add new tasks to private projects.
    *   Edit columns, categories, swimlanes, and tags within private projects.
    *   Add and remove automatic actions on private projects.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   View the names of tags associated with private projects.
    *   Download attachments from private projects.
    *   View thumbnails of images from private projects.
*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:**
    *   Remove columns, categories, and automatic actions from private projects.
    *   Remove attachments from private projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Data Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of HTTP form data, by changing parameters like project IDs, task IDs, etc. These parameters are sent in the request body.
*   **HTTP Request Modification:** The attacker crafts or modifies HTTP requests by including unauthorized resource identifiers, such as project IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Kanboard instance.
*   **Knowledge of Target Resource IDs:** The attacker needs to know or guess the IDs of the private projects they want to target, the resources that they want to modify, or be able to enumerate them using other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit links (`074f6c104f3e49401ef0065540338fc2d4be79f0`, `3e0f14ae2b0b5a44bd038a472f17eac75f538524`, and `7100f6de8a1f566e260b3e65312767e4cde112b1`) contain the fixes that address this vulnerability by enforcing proper access controls in the respective controllers.
* The vulnerability is addressed in Kanboard version 1.0.47.
*   The report suggests multiple specific instances where the vulnerability was found, such as editing project info, adding tasks, editing project elements (columns, categories), adding actions, removing items, accessing attachments, etc.
