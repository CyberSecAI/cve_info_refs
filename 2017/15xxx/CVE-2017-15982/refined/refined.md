Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the News Magazine & Blog CMS version 1.0.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands. The vulnerability exists in the `admin_process.php` script, specifically within the `act` parameters `vdoeditform` and `cateditform` when combined with an `id` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain administrative access to the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious SQL queries within the `id` parameter of the specified `admin_process.php` script calls.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication is mentioned as required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit examples demonstrate how an attacker could construct SQL injection payloads to extract data and potentially bypass authentication.
*   The exploit utilizes techniques such as `UNION SELECT` and specific MySQL functions to extract data and potentially retrieve the admin username and password.
*   The exploit examples provided demonstrate how an attacker can extract data such as usernames, passwords, database schema information, and potentially other sensitive data.
