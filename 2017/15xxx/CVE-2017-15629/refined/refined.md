The provided content contains information about multiple command injection vulnerabilities affecting various TP-Link router models. This analysis focuses on CVE-2017-15629 as described in the document.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation in the `pptp_client.lua` file. Specifically, the `new-tunnelname` variable, which is part of the data received via HTTP POST requests, is not properly sanitized before being used in a system call, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is command injection. Malicious input supplied through the `new-tunnelname` variable allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the router.
- Lack of input sanitization: The lua script does not properly validate or sanitize the user-provided data passed as `new-tunnelname` before using it in a system command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected TP-Link router with the privileges of the web server. This can have severe consequences, such as:
- Complete system compromise: Attacker can gain control of the router.
- Data theft/modification: Attacker can potentially steal sensitive information from the router or manipulate its settings.
- Denial of Service: Attacker can disrupt router functionality by crashing processes or overloading resources.
- Network Pivoting: The compromised router can be used as a pivot point to attack other devices on the same network or to conduct wider network attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a specific URL, including the malicious command in the `new-tunnelname` variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authentication: The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator on the routerâ€™s web management interface. This likely requires the attacker to know the admin credentials.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, either from within the local network (LAN) or from the internet (WAN) if remote management is enabled.
- HTTP knowledge: The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests with specific data formats and to use HTTP sessions.
