Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the login area of the E-Sic Software Livre CMS. It allows bypassing authentication by manipulating the username and password parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses an SQL injection technique.
*  **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of the `login` and `password` parameters, which are likely directly inserted into a SQL query without any validation. Specifically, the payload `login='='or'` and `password='='or'` will create a condition that is always true, allowing any user to log in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain access to the administrative panel of the CMS without valid credentials.
*   **Full Control:** Once inside the admin panel, the attacker could have full control over the system, leading to further damage, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the login page (`http://vulnsite/esic/index/index.php`).
*   **Manipulated Parameters:** The POST data contains the `login` and `password` parameters with specific malicious SQL injection payload `login=%27%3D%27%27or%27&password=%27%3D%27%27or%27`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CMS instance.
*   **Knowledge of the Login URL:** The attacker must know the exact URL of the login page (`http://vulnsite/esic/index/index.php`).
*   **Understanding of HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP POST requests with specific parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided exploit details are more specific than a typical CVE description, providing a concrete payload for exploitation.
*  The EDB entry does not include a CVE ID, indicating that it may not be officially tracked by MITRE or other CVE numbering authorities.

This analysis demonstrates that the provided content details a significant vulnerability, namely an authentication bypass via SQL injection, which allows an attacker to gain administrative access to the vulnerable system.
