Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `lkpcep.php` file of the E-Sic Software livre CMS. Specifically, the `$q` variable receives user input from the `$_REQUEST['q']` parameter without any prior validation or filtering. This unsanitized input is then directly injected into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. Due to the lack of output from the query, attackers must rely on techniques like timing attacks (using `SLEEP()`) to infer information about the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including schema information, usernames, passwords, and other critical data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `q` parameter in the GET request to `lkpcep.php`.
  - vulnerable URL example: `http://vulnerable/esiclivre/restrito/inc/lkpcep.php?q=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and must be able to access the `lkpcep.php` file (no authentication required).
- The attacker would benefit from some knowledge of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.
- Tools like `sqlmap` can automate the exploitation process.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit payload is:
    `1' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5-(IF(ORD(MID((SELECT DISTINCT(HEX(IFNULL(CAST(schema_name AS CHAR),0x20))) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA LIMIT 13,1),11,1))>1,0,5)))))oslN)-- UACx`
- The exploit utilizes `SLEEP()` to introduce delays based on conditional logic within the injected SQL, allowing the attacker to extract information bit by bit.

- The blog post by k33rok provides more context, stating that the vulnerable code is in the "search private area" of e-sic and that it can be accessed without authentication.
- The Exploit-DB entry also references the k33rok blog post and provides a command to test using sqlmap.

This detailed analysis provides a good explanation of the vulnerability, its cause, potential impact, and how it can be exploited, which aligns well with the description of CVE-2017-15373.
