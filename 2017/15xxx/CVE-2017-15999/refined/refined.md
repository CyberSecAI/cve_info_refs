Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the NQ Contacts Backup & Restore app:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of HTTPS Usage:** The app transmits sensitive data, including login credentials and contact information, over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
*   **Static Encryption Keys:** The app uses hardcoded, static keys for RC4 and DES encryption algorithms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Data Transport:** Usernames are transmitted in cleartext, and passwords, while hashed with SHA-1, are vulnerable to cracking.
*   **Weak Encryption:** Use of SHA-1 hashing for passwords is considered weak.
*   **Static RC4 Key:** The static RC4 key allows for easy decryption of passwords stored in shared preferences.
*   **Static DES Key:** The static DES key allows for decryption of contact data transmitted and stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can intercept login credentials (username and password) and contact data. This enables unauthorized access to user accounts and personal information.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can download stored contacts from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same network can eavesdrop on HTTP traffic to intercept data being sent by the app.
*   **Access to shared preferences:** An attacker with access to the device (e.g., through malware) can extract encrypted passwords, decrypt them using the static key, and gain access to user data.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker can intercept traffic between the app and the server to obtain login information or contact data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the user or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs the technical knowledge to perform network sniffing, SHA-1 cracking, RC4 decryption, and DES decryption.
*   **Device Access (For shared preferences):** Local access to the device or ability to execute code on the device is required to exploit the static keys.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post notes that the app shares a codebase with NQ Mobile Security & Anti Virus which might imply similar vulnerabilities in the other app.
* The content suggests that the vendor was contacted regarding these vulnerabilities without any response.
