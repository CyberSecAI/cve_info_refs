      "is_related": true,
      "details": "The provided content includes a commit in the webmin repository which addresses a security issue. The commit message is \"Escape potentially malicious HTTP headers\", and the code changes show modifications to the `web-lib-funcs.pl` file to escape HTML characters in error messages related to HTTP downloads. Specifically, when a download fails, the error message includes a reason such as a failure to write to a file, invalid location header etc.. These errors are now being passed through `html_escape` before being displayed. This patch directly relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-15646, which involves an XSS issue triggered by a malicious server returning crafted HTTP headers.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unescaped error messages from HTTP headers in download functionality. Specifically, error messages related to download failures would include unescaped http header information such as `Location` headers or error messages from failed writes.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of HTTP headers in download error messages.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious server that responds with crafted HTTP headers during a download operation that can be used to execute arbitrary Javascript in the user's browser.\n*   **Attack vectors:** A Webmin user uses the upload/download functionality to download from a malicious server that returns crafted HTTP headers that are included in the error message. \n*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control a webserver that can be accessed by the Webmin server. The Webmin user would also need to use the upload/download functionality and be directed to the attacker controlled server."
