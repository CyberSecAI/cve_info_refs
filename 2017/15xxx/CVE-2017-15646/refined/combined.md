## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

#### XSS vulnerabilities if Webmin is installed using the `setup.pl` script [CVE-2021-31760, CVE-2021-31761 and CVE-2021-31762][#](#xss-vulnerabilities-if-webmin-is-installed-using-the-setuppl-script-cve-2021-31760-cve-2021-31761-and-cve-2021-31762)

* If Webmin is installed using the non-recommended `setup.pl` script, checking for unknown referers is not enabled by default. This opens the system up to XSS and CSRF attacks using malicious links. Fortunately the standard `rpm`, `deb`, `pkg` and `tar` packages do not use this script and so are not vulnerable. If you did install using the `setup.pl` script, the vulnerability can be fixed by adding the line `referers_none=1` to `/etc/webmin/config` file.

### Webmin 1.882 to 1.921 [July 6, 2019][#](#webmin-1882-to-1921-july-6-2019)

#### Remote Command Execution [CVE-2019-15231][#](#remote-command-execution-cve-2019-15231)

* Webmin releases between these versions contain a vulnerability that allows remote command execution! Version 1.890 is vulnerable in a default install and should be upgraded immediately - other versions are only vulnerable if changing of expired passwords is enabled, which is not the case by default.

  Either way, upgrading to version 1.930 is strongly recommended. Alternately, if running versions 1.900 to 1.920, edit `/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf`, remove the `passwd_mode=` line, then run `/etc/webmin/restart` command.
  More details..Webmin version 1.890 was released with a backdoor that could allow anyone with knowledge of it to execute commands as root. Versions 1.900 to 1.920 also contained a backdoor using similar code, but it was not exploitable in a default Webmin install. Only if the admin had enabled the feature at **Webmin â¾ Webmin Configuration â¾ Authentication** to allow changing of expired passwords could it be used by an attacker.

  Neither of these were accidental bugs - rather, the Webmin source code had been maliciously modified to add a non-obvious vulnerability. It appears that this happened as follows :

  + At some time in April 2018, the Webmin development build server was exploited and a vulnerability added to the `password_change.cgi` script. Because the timestamp on the file was set back, it did not show up in any Git diffs. This was included in the Webmin 1.890 release.
  + The vulnerable file was reverted to the checked-in version from GitHub, but sometime in July 2018 the file was modified again by the attacker. However, this time the exploit was added to code that is only executed if changing of expired passwords is enabled. This was included in the Webmin 1.900 release.
  + On September 10th 2018, the vulnerable build server was decommissioned and replaced with a newly installed server running CentOS 7. However, the build directory containing the modified file was copied across from backups made on the original server.
  + On August 17th 2019, we were informed that a 0-day exploit that made use of the vulnerability had been released. In response, the exploit code was removed and Webmin version 1.930 created and released to all users.

  In order to prevent similar attacks in future, we’re doing the following :

  + Updating the build process to use only checked-in code from GitHub, rather than a local directory that is kept in sync.
  + Rotated all passwords and keys accessible from the old build system.
  + Auditing all GitHub commits over the past year to look for commits that may have introduced similar vulnerabilities.

#### Remote Command Execution (Metasploit)[#](#remote-command-execution-metasploit)

* This is *not* a workable exploit as it requires that the attacker already know the root password. Hence there is no fix for it in Webmin.

### Webmin 1.590 and below [June 30, 2012][#](#webmin-1590-and-below-june-30-2012)

#### XSS (cross-site scripting) security hole[#](#xss-cross-site-scripting-security-hole)

* A malicious website could create links or JavaScript referencing the File Manager module that allowed execution of arbitrary commands via Webmin when the website is viewed by the victim. See [CERT vulnerability note VU#788478](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/788478) for more details. Thanks to Jared Allar from the American Information Security Group for reporting this problem.

#### Referer checks don’t include port[#](#referer-checks-dont-include-port)

* If an attacker has control over `http://example.com/` then he/she could create a page with malicious JavaScript that could take over a Webmin session at `https://example.com:10000/` when `http://example.com/` is viewed by the victim.

### Virtualmin 3.70 and below [June 23, 2009][#](#virtualmin-370-and-below-june-23-2009)

#### Unsafe file writes in Virtualmin[#](#unsafe-file-writes-in-virtualmin)

* This bug allows a virtual server owner to read or write to arbitrary files on the system by creating malicious symbolic links and then having Virtualmin perform operations on those links. Upgrading to version 3.70 is strongly recommended if your system has un-trusted domain owners.

### Webmin 1.390 and below, Usermin 1.320 and below [February 8, 2008][#](#webmin-1390-and-below-usermin-1320-and-below-february-8-2008)

#### XSS (cross-site scripting) security hole[#](#xss-cross-site-scripting-security-hole-2)

* This attack could open users who visit un-trusted websites while having Webmin open in the same browser up to having their session cookie captured, which could then allow an attacker to login to Webmin without a password. The quick fix is to go to the **Webmin Configuration** module, click on the **Trusted Referers** icon, set **Referrer checking enabled?** to **Yes**, and un-check the box **Trust links from unknown referrers**. Webmin 1.400 and Usermin 1.330 will make these settings the defaults.

### Webmin 1.380 and below [November 3, 2007][#](#webmin-1380-and-below-november-3-2007)

#### Windows-only command execution bug[#](#windows-only-command-execution-bug)

* Any user logged into Webmin can execute any command using special URL parameters. This could be used by less-privileged Webmin users to raise their level of access.

### Webmin 1.330 and below, Usermin 1.260 and below[#](#webmin-1330-and-below-usermin-1260-and-below)

#### XSS bug in `chooser.cgi` script[#](#xss-bug-in-choosercgi-script)

* When using Webmin or Usermin to browse files on a system that were created by an attacker, a specially crafted filename could be used to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the browser.

### Webmin 1.296 and below, Usermin 1.226 and below[#](#webmin-1296-and-below-usermin-1226-and-below)

#### Remote source code access[#](#remote-source-code-access)

* An attacker can view the source code of Webmin CGI and Perl programs using a specially crafted URL. Because the source code for Webmin is freely available, this issue should only be of concern to sites that have custom modules for which they want the source to remain hidden.

#### XSS bug[#](#xss-bug)

* The XSS bug makes use of a similar technique to craft a URL that can allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the user’s browser if a malicious link is clicked on.

> Thanks for Keigo Yamazaki of Little eArth Corporation for finding this bug.

### Webmin 1.290 and below, Usermin 1.220 and below[#](#webmin-1290-and-below-usermin-1220-and-below)

#### Arbitrary remote file access[#](#arbitrary-remote-file-access)

* An attacker without a login to Webmin can read the contents of any file on the server using a specially crafted URL. All users should upgrade to version 1.290 as soon as possible, or setup IP access control in Webmin.

> Thanks to Kenny Chen for bringing this to my attention.

### Webmin 1.280 and below[#](#webmin-1280-and-below)

#### Windows arbitrary file access[#](#windows-arbitrary-file-access)

* If running Webmin on Windows, an attacker can remotely view the contents of any file on your system using a specially crafted URL. This does not affect other operating systems, but if you use Webmin on Windows you should upgrade to version 1.280 or later.

> Thanks to Keigo Yamazaki of Little eArth Corporation for discovering this bug.

### Webmin 1.250 and below, Usermin 1.180 and below[#](#webmin-1250-and-below-usermin-1180-and-below)

#### Perl syslog input attack[#](#perl-syslog-input-attack)

* When logging of failing login attempts via `syslog` is enabled, an attacker can crash and possibly take over the Webmin webserver, due to un-checked input being passed to Perl’s `syslog` function. Upgrading to the latest release of Webmin is recommended.

> Thanks to Jack at Dyad Security for reporting this problem to me.

### Webmin 1.220 and below, Usermin 1.150 and below[#](#webmin-1220-and-below-usermin-1150-and-below)

#### Full PAM conversations’ mode remote attack[#](#full-pam-conversations-mode-remote-attack)

* Affects systems when the option **Support full PAM conversations?** is enabled on the **Webmin â¾ Webmin Configuration â¾ Authentication** page. When this option is enabled in Webmin or Usermin, an attacker can gain remote access to Webmin without needing to supply a valid login or password. Fortunately this option is not enabled by default and is rarely used unless you have a PAM setup that requires more than just a username and password, but upgrading is advised anyway.

> Thanks to Keigo Yamazaki of Little eArth Corporation and [JPCERT/CC](http://www.jpcert.or.jp/) for discovering and notifying me of this bug.

### Webmin 1.175 and below, Usermin 1.104 and below[#](#webmin-1175-and-below-usermin-1104-and-below)

#### Brute force password guessing attack[#](#brute-force-password-guessing-attack)

* Prior Webmin and Usermin versions do not have password timeouts turned on by default, so an attacker can try every possible password for the *root* or admin user until he/she finds the correct one.
  The solution is to enable password timeouts, so that repeated attempts to login as the same user will become progressively slower. This can be done by following these steps :

  + Go to the **Webmin Configuration** module.
  + Click on the **Authentication** icon.
  + Select the **Enable password timeouts** button.
  + Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.

  This problem is also present in Usermin, and can be prevented by following the same steps in the **Usermin Configuration** module.

### Webmin 1.150 and below, Usermin 1.080 and below[#](#webmin-1150-and-below-usermin-1080-and-below)

#### XSS vulnerability[#](#xss-vulnerability)

* When viewing HTML email, several potentially dangerous types of URLs can be passed through. This can be used to perform malicious actions like executing commands as the logged-in Usermin user.

#### Module configurations are visible[#](#module-configurations-are-visible)

* Even if a Webmin user does not have access to a module, he/she can still view it’s Module Config page by entering a URL that calls `config.cgi` with the module name as a parameter.

#### Account lockout attack[#](#account-lockout-attack)

* By sending a specially constructed password, an attacker can lock out other users if password timeouts are enabled.
