## FAQ

### How to set custom cron task for clearing reserved slots

Create cron task on your host that have this link : `wget -q -O - <STIE_URL>/?_ea-action=clear_reservations > /dev/null 2>&1` . This will delete all reservations older than 6min.

### How to translate labels

Form labels can change in settings page but if you want to translate rest of it you need to create translation file. Here is video tutorial for that :  [Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOnta9_Ysno)

### How to hide service / location / worker in front end part of form?

To do this you must create one location / worker or service and set Name that starts with underscore. For example : *\_dummy*, *\_location*…

### In admin panel all pages from plugin are blank?

You have probably turned on option in PHP called asp\_tags, you need to turn it off in order to plugin work properly.

### I can’t edit or delete any settings?

Your hosting is probably blocking HTTP PUT and DELETE method. You must mark option called ‘Compatibility mode’ in settings.

### How to set multiple slots for one combination of location, service, worker?

To add more slots per (location, service, worker) combination just clone the existing one. For two slots you need to

have that connection twice.

### How to insert Easy Appointments widget on Page/Post?

layout\_cols : default value 1

[all available shortcode options](https://easy-appointments.com/documentation/#bootstrap)

Example :

[ea\_bootstrap width=”800px” scroll\_off=”true” layout\_cols=”2″]

### How to set form in two columns?

You can set bootstrap form in two columns with `layout_cols` option. Example :

```
[ea_bootstrap width="800px" scroll_off="true" layout_cols="2"]

```

### How to create calendar only for one worker / service / location

If you want to have separate calendars base on worker for example. You can do that by setting default worker inside short code.

[ea\_bootstrap worker=”1″]

Value is worker #id number. Examples :

```
[ea_bootstrap worker="1"]
[ea_bootstrap worker="1" location="1"]
[ea_bootstrap worker="1" location="1" service="1"]

```

Note: you can have only one calendar on one page.

On 9/9/2024 I purchased a license for Easy Appointments and was immediately informed that I would receive a email “shortly” with all I needed to go forward with it, including access to the support forum on the Author’s site. Ten days later no such email. (And I get NO redirection of “spam mail”, checking it all manually.
This would have gone to the support forum instead of here. But no access.
How do I get access to the paid version and to the support forums?

The plugin doesn’t work as advertised and there’s practically NO SUPPORT by the author. A ticket was created SIX WEEKS ago but the author surfaces every several days, only to throw a hasty and inefficient comment and then he disappears again. Steer clear of this one
