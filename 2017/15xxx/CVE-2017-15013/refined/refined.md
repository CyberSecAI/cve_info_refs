Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15013:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a design flaw in how OpenText Documentum Content Server manages metadata about uploaded files. Specifically, the server stores information about uploaded files in `dmr_content` objects. These objects are queryable and, critically, editable (or at least deletable and recreatable) by any authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Object Management:** The core issue is that `dmr_content` objects, which can point to sensitive file system resources, are modifiable by any authenticated user.
- **Lack of Access Control:** There is insufficient access control on the modification of `dmr_content` objects that are related to critical objects such as `dm_method` objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated attacker can modify the `dmr_content` object associated with a `dm_method` object.
- By replacing the content of a `dm_method` object, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Documentum server superuser, effectively gaining full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack is performed over the network through the Documentum server's RPC interface.
- **Authentication Required:**  The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate to the Documentum Content Server.
- **Object Manipulation:** The attacker modifies `dmr_content` objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid login credentials for an account on the affected Documentum server.
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must have network access to the Documentum server.
- **Understanding of Documentum APIs:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Documentum server's API to query and modify objects.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit code provided in the exploit-db entry demonstrates how to:
    - Connect to the Documentum server using provided credentials.
    - Find a suitable `dm_method` object with associated content.
    - Delete the existing `dmr_content` object
    - Upload a malicious new `dmr_content` object that points to attacker controlled content
    - Execute the modified `dm_method` as the superuser, granting the attacker superuser privileges.
- This vulnerability was present in all versions of the OpenText Documentum Content Server at the time of discovery.
- The provided code uses `dmbasic` to inject code to modify privileges of a user.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 Base Score of 8.8, indicating high severity.
