Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-15396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **stack overflow** within the **V8 JavaScript engine**, which is a core component of the Chromium browser. This indicates a memory management issue where data written to the stack exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a stack overflow, meaning an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack memory which is used for storing function call information, potentially overwriting return addresses or other critical data used by the application

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This could lead to complete control over the user's browser and potentially the whole system.
*   **System Compromise:**  Exploiting this could lead to system compromise, meaning the attacker has unauthorized access or control over the user's system.
*   **Crash/Denial of Service:** Even without executing arbitrary code, exploiting this vulnerability could cause the browser to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Web Content:** The primary attack vector is through the processing of malformed or malicious web content. Specifically, visiting a webpage containing crafted JavaScript code can trigger the stack overflow.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, requiring no local access or authentication by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious web content that can be accessed by the victim's browser. This could be through a compromised website, a malicious advertisement, or any other means of serving web content to the victim.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials to exploit this vulnerability, as it is triggered by merely visiting the crafted webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by an external researcher, Yuan Deng of Ant-financial Light-Year Security Lab.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 62.0.3202.75 and later.
*   Red Hat has classified this as an "Important" security issue, indicating the potential for significant compromise.
*   The exploit can be triggered remotely, making it critical to update affected systems.
*   The provided content includes a Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2017:3082) which addresses this issue.
