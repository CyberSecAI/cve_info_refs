The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in PRTG Network Manager, including those related to CVE-2017-15008.

**Root cause of vulnerability (CVE-2017-15008):**
- The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input in several locations, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize or encode user input before displaying it, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The `error.htm` page is vulnerable to reflected XSS via the `errormsg` parameter, which is susceptible to URL encoded scripts.
- **Stored XSS:** Sensor titles are vulnerable to stored XSS. When a user hovers over the sensor, the payload is executed from the tooltip box.
- **Stored XSS in Groups:** Similar to the sensor titles, group names are also vulnerable to stored XSS, with the payload being executed in the tooltip when hovering over the group name.
- **File upload vulnerability:** Although the system rejects the upload of files that are not images, it still saves the files to the server. This can allow an attacker to upload a malicious executable (.exe) file, and if executed by the server admin, it could provide a shell on the server.
- **Access Control Flaw:** A read-only user can create a map through a forged request, despite the server showing an error. This is related to the file upload flaw, which occurs during map creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Exploitation can lead to session hijacking by stealing session IDs from administrators or users, by injecting malicious JavaScript code. The attacker can then gain access to the application with the compromised user's privileges and potentially perform actions on their behalf.
- **File upload vulnerability:** Exploitation can lead to remote code execution if the uploaded file is executed by the server administrator.
- **Access Control Flaw:** Exploitation can lead to the creation of unauthorized maps using forged requests. This can be combined with the file upload vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:**  The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing a payload and trick a user into visiting this URL, often through social engineering.
- **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have write privileges to create or modify sensors or groups using a malicious payload.
- **File Upload Vulnerability:**  The attacker needs to upload a malicious file to the server, which could lead to remote code execution if the server admin executes it.
- **Access Control Flaw:** The attacker needs to forge a request to create a map, even with read-only privileges, to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click a malicious link.
- **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with write access to modify sensor titles or group names.
- **File Upload Vulnerability:** The attacker needs access to the server to upload the malicious file.
- **Access Control Flaw:** The attacker needs to have access to the system, even as a read-only user.
