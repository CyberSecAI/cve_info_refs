Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2017-15137 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** The image import whitelist in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 does not properly enforce restrictions, allowing bypass.
*   **Root Cause:** The image import whitelist is enforced when running "oc import-image", but not when running "oc tag" or when directly creating an imagestream tag that references a non-whitelisted registry.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could bypass the image import whitelist by using "oc tag" or creating an ImageStream tag that references a non-whitelisted registry.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with access to OpenShift could run images from registries that should not be allowed.
*   **Affected Versions:** OpenShift Container Platform 3.9. OCP 3.7 is not affected because the ability to whitelist image repositories was only added in 3.9.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in the release of OpenShift 3.9 via RHBA-2018:0489.
