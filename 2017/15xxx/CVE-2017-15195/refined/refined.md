Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper authorization checks in various controllers of the Kanboard application. Specifically, the application was not validating that the user making requests had the required permissions to modify or access resources belonging to other users' private projects. The application was relying on user-provided IDs from forms instead of verifying permissions on the server side, which allowed for tampering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References:** The application used direct object references (e.g., IDs in form data) without properly validating user authorization, making it vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The controllers lacked checks to ensure that a user could only modify or access resources (projects, tasks, categories, columns, swimlanes, tags, actions, comments, subtasks, external/internal links, attachments etc.) associated with their own projects.
*   **CSRF Protection Bypass:** Although CSRF protection was present, it was not sufficient to prevent the described attacks.
*   **Lack of Parameter Validation:** The application did not properly validate the `project_id` and related IDs to ensure that they belonged to the current user, enabling privilege escalation.
*   **Exposed IDs in Forms:** The application was exposing internal IDs in forms, allowing users to easily manipulate these values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An authenticated user could:

*   Modify private projects of other users.
*   Add tasks, categories, columns, swimlanes, and actions to other users' private projects.
*   Edit tasks, categories, columns, swimlanes, tags, and actions in other users' private projects.
*   Remove columns, categories, and actions from other users' private projects.
*   View the name of tags in other users' private projects.
*   Download attachments from a private project of another user.
*   See thumbnails of pictures from a private project of another user.
*   Remove attachments from a private project of another user.
*   Edit, create, and remove comments and subtasks for other user's tasks.
*   Add external and internal task links to another user's tasks.

In essence, this allowed for complete privilege escalation within the application, enabling unauthorized access to and manipulation of other users' private data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Data Manipulation:** Attackers could intercept and modify the HTTP requests containing form data, altering IDs to reference resources belonging to other users.
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers could directly craft HTTP requests with manipulated parameters to interact with the application's endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Kanboard application.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges, just a valid user account.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inspect the HTTP requests made by the browser and manipulate them or craft new HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content includes commit logs that show the fixes implemented to address these issues. These fixes primarily involve:
*   Adding checks to various controller functions to verify if the user has access to the resource specified by the ID in the HTTP request
*   Not relying on user provided project/task/etc. IDs, but getting the actual resource, based on the ID provided in the URL.

The commit messages explicitly state "Avoid people to alter other projects by changing form data" and "Do not expose IDs in forms." This highlights the core of the problem â€“ the application's vulnerability to parameter tampering.

The email from `chbi@...i.eu` to the `oss-security` mailing list details multiple instances of these vulnerabilities and lists the specific actions that could be performed by an attacker.

This is a classical example of insecure direct object reference and missing authorization, where the application failed to validate if a user was authorized to access a given resource via its ID.
