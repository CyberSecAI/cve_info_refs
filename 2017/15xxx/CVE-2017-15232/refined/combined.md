# USN-3706-1: libjpeg-turbo vulnerabilities

9 July 2018

libjpeg-turbo could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [libjpeg-turbo](/security/cves?package=libjpeg-turbo) - library for handling JPEG files

## Details

It was discovered that libjpeg-turbo incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted JPEG image, a remote attacker could cause libjpeg-turbo

to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

### @kornelski **[kornelski](/kornelski)** commented [Sep 30, 2017](#issue-261842206)

I've got a report about a crash:

[mozilla/mozjpeg#268](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg/issues/268)

I've handled in the function that crashed (jquant1.c) as well as up the stack in the function that was the real cause of it (`read_and_discard_scanlines` uses `NULL` buffer and expects that to be handled gracefully).

Sorry, something went wrong.

That seems kinda iffy of `read_and_discard_scanlines`. Is it actually intended to do that?

It is iffy, but I don't know that function. I suppose NULL works well for discarding :)

Looking at [this](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg/blob/6ee36adc4eaaac0837e86f22ec6c8cafe4b84c92/jdapistd.c#L296-L302), it seems like it's a bit of a hack anyway, so I guess the check is OK. :/

NIT: libjpeg style is to use `(buf == NULL)` (probably because of some mythical system where this will fail due to NULL being implementation defined as a a type of zero value).

| Hi, guys. I didn't write the feature in question, and apparently the author (a former Google employee) is now working elsewhere. I have a grant from Mozilla that I can use to look into this, but I need to clear some other things from my plate first. It seems like I'm going to need to really dig into the issue and re-examine some aspects of this feature, and probably design better unit tests to guard against this sort of thing in the future. I'll keep you posted. |

| Your patch was unfortunately insufficient to address all facets of the bug. Now that I have partial image decompression working with GIF output files, I was able to reproduce this bug with all of the various color quantization functions by passing various switches to djpeg. The root cause is that `jpeg_skip_scanlines()` was not properly handling color quantization. It needed to set up a dummy `color_quantize()` function just like it sets up a dummy `color_convert()` function. [5bc43c7](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/5bc43c7821df982f65aa1c738f67fbf7cba8bd69) fixes the issue and also fixes [#185](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/185) the right way, by establishing a new method in the djpeg\_dest\_mgr object that recomputes the buffer dimensions for output formats that work with `-crop`. BMP and RLE still cannot work with `-crop`, unfortunately, because those formats use a whole-image inversion buffer to write the scanlines in bottom-up order. However, having GIF support for the partial image decompression feature is useful, because it makes it easy to reproduce this bug. The following script should complete successfully if the bug is fully fixed:  ``` #!/bin/bash set -e  SRCDIR=.. BUILDDIR=.  for onepass in -onepass ""; do 	for format in gif targa; do 		for dither in fs ordered none; do 			for grayscale in -grayscale ""; do 				echo $BUILDDIR/djpeg -dct int -colors 256 -crop 98x98+12+12 $onepass -$format -dither $dither $grayscale -outfile out$onepass$grayscale-$dither.$format $SRCDIR/testimages/testorig.jpg 				$BUILDDIR/djpeg -dct int -colors 256 -crop 98x98+12+12 $onepass -$format -dither $dither $grayscale -outfile out$onepass$grayscale-$dither.$format $SRCDIR/testimages/testorig.jpg 			done 		done 	done done  cat <<EOF >$BUILDDIR/md5sum.txt 0e36d86afcd4eba7087dcf9764fcc7bc  out-onepass-grayscale-fs.gif 4ebda254d42cbdb29c878f96b5aef3f6  out-onepass-fs.gif c28e92b57a9d63d1f8d32f396389ca29  out-onepass-grayscale-ordered.gif 9f1c31949ed3479907775f4abc6295ec  out-onepass-ordered.gif c28e92b57a9d63d1f8d32f396389ca29  out-onepass-grayscale-none.gif 9a18b6bbb5eeab29cd5404e755268269  out-onepass-none.gif 0c2e1ef486b21853dc670e65f53a364a  out-onepass-grayscale-fs.targa 75d8a0cf3990fec306faed32dcd8957d  out-onepass-fs.targa 82cdc85ca549e741e73a29b507cf0978  out-onepass-grayscale-ordered.targa d8e7b513810034172c4ce5a9e6c6d3d3  out-onepass-ordered.targa 82cdc85ca549e741e73a29b507cf0978  out-onepass-grayscale-none.targa 0201ff3e239a93d12c5d7cafdec594db  out-onepass-none.targa 0e36d86afcd4eba7087dcf9764fcc7bc  out-grayscale-fs.gif e6a7dbbcd3e176f818837b9050e25e15  out-fs.gif c28e92b57a9d63d1f8d32f396389ca29  out-grayscale-ordered.gif e6a7dbbcd3e176f818837b9050e25e15  out-ordered.gif c28e92b57a9d63d1f8d32f396389ca29  out-grayscale-none.gif 741f3cf5fde61737729c13369e5845e3  out-none.gif 0c2e1ef486b21853dc670e65f53a364a  out-grayscale-fs.targa 1337a8c2d91658a10e98f4729cd4717f  out-fs.targa 82cdc85ca549e741e73a29b507cf0978  out-grayscale-ordered.targa 1337a8c2d91658a10e98f4729cd4717f  out-ordered.targa 82cdc85ca549e741e73a29b507cf0978  out-grayscale-none.targa f0e89205504cca725b936a4809b86fcf  out-none.targa EOF  md5sum -c $BUILDDIR/md5sum.txt  echo GREAT SUCCESS!  ``` |

  jpeg_skip_scanlines() when used with 4:2:0 merged upsampling/color
  conversion.)

- Fix issues in jpeg_skip_scanlines() that caused incorrect output with
  h2v2 (4:2:0) merged upsampling/color conversion.  The previous commit
  fixed the segfault reported in #441, but that was a symptom of a
  larger problem.  Because merged 4:2:0 upsampling uses a \"spare row\"
  buffer, it is necessary to allow the upsampler to run when skipping
  rows (fancy 4:2:0 upsampling, which uses context rows, also requires
  this.)  Otherwise, if skipping starts at an odd-numbered row, the
  output image will be incorrect.

- Throw an error if jpeg_skip_scanlines() is called with two-pass color
  quantization enabled.  With two-pass color quantization, the first
  pass occurs within jpeg_start_decompress(), so subsequent calls to
  jpeg_skip_scanlines() interfere with the multipass state and prevent
  the second pass from occurring during subsequent calls to
  jpeg_read_scanlines().")`

`[ab835bc](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/ab835bc4cc6489e6846a6224d12cfc19d0ea28ab)`

```
- Introduce a partial image decompression regression test script that
  validates the correctness of jpeg_skip_scanlines() and
  jpeg_crop_scanlines() for a variety of cropping regions and libjpeg
  settings.

  This regression test catches the following issues:
  [#182](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/pull/182), fixed in [5bc43c7](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/5bc43c7821df982f65aa1c738f67fbf7cba8bd69)
  [#237](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/237), fixed in [6e95c08](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/6e95c08649794f5018608f37250026a45ead2db8)
  [#244](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/pull/244), fixed in [398c1e9](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/398c1e9acc9b4531edceb3d77da0de5744675052)
  [#441](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/441), fully fixed in this commit

  It does not catch the following issues:
  [#194](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/194), fixed in [773040f](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/773040f9d949d5f313caf7507abaf4bd5d7ffa12)
  [#244](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/pull/244) (additional segfault), fixed in
       [9120a24](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/9120a247436e84c0b4eea828cb11e8f665fcde30)

- Modify the libjpeg-turbo regression test suite (make test) so that it
  checks for the issue reported in [#441](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/441) (segfault in
  jpeg_skip_scanlines() when used with 4:2:0 merged upsampling/color
  conversion.)

- Fix issues in jpeg_skip_scanlines() that caused incorrect output with
  h2v2 (4:2:0) merged upsampling/color conversion.  The previous commit
  fixed the segfault reported in [#441](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/441), but that was a symptom of a
  larger problem.  Because merged 4:2:0 upsampling uses a "spare row"
  buffer, it is necessary to allow the upsampler to run when skipping
  rows (fancy 4:2:0 upsampling, which uses context rows, also requires
  this.)  Otherwise, if skipping starts at an odd-numbered row, the
  output image will be incorrect.

- Throw an error if jpeg_skip_scanlines() is called with two-pass color
  quantization enabled.  With two-pass color quantization, the first
  pass occurs within jpeg_start_decompress(), so subsequent calls to
  jpeg_skip_scanlines() interfere with the multipass state and prevent
  the second pass from occurring during subsequent calls to
  jpeg_read_scanlines().
