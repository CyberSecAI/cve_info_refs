Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-15096

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference occurs in the `send_brick_req` function within the `glusterfsd/src/gf_attach.c` file. This happens due to mishandling of null checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is a null pointer dereference, which can lead to a program crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause a local denial of service of the `glusterfsd` daemon.
- **Limited Scope DoS:** It's important to note that the denial of service is limited to `glusterfsd`. The I/O path and other management operations are not affected.
- **Crash:** The daemon crashes when a null pointer is dereferenced.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** Worst case scenario is that gf_attach runs out of memory, leading to a crash

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation. The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `glusterfsd` daemon locally.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered low severity due to the limited impact (local DoS) and the fact that a memory allocation failure (expected behaviour) is simply replaced with a null pointer dereference and crash. It's not a clear *security* bug.
- The issue is related to how `gf_attach` handles memory allocation failure. Instead of returning an error (ENOMEM) the program attempts to use a NULL pointer, crashing the daemon.
- The bug was closed with a status of "WONTFIX", suggesting that the risk was considered low and the impact not critical enough to justify a fix, or that the issue is mitigated.
