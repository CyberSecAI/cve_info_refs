Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the `userfaultfd_event_wait_completion` function in `fs/userfaultfd.c` of the Linux kernel. This occurs when handling fork events for `VM_SHARED` hugetlbfs mappings. Specifically, the issue arises when an additional implicit page unlock is performed in the context of such mappings, potentially leading to the reuse of a freed page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability. In the `userfaultfd_ctx_read` function, a fork event (`UFFD_EVENT_FORK`) is temporarily placed on a `fork_event` list, and the associated `userfaultfd_ctx` may be freed if the `resolve_userfault_fork` operation fails (e.g., due to insufficient file descriptors for the fork), however, the event allocated in fork kernel stack might be not properly removed from `fork_event` list before this event is freed.  After releasing `event_wqh.lock`, and failure in `resolve_userfault_fork()`, the event may be removed in `userfaultfd_event_wait_completion` from an already freed list (`fork_event`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a local denial-of-service by crashing the kernel. The crash is indicated by a kernel BUG at `mm/filemap.c:964!` due to an invalid operation on a page that is already unlocked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** A local attacker with the ability to create and manipulate `VM_SHARED` hugetlbfs mappings can trigger the vulnerability, by failing the forking after userfault read event.
*   **Specific Kernel Function:** Exploitation requires interaction with the `userfaultfd` subsystem, particularly related to handling fork events and shared memory mappings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user privileges to be able to interact with the `userfaultfd` system.
*   **Ability to Create and Manipulate HugeTLB mappings:** An attacker needs to be able to create `VM_SHARED` hugetlbfs mappings and trigger a userfault.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, MRG-2, and kernel-rt before version `kernel-3.10.0-781`.
*   The fix involves ensuring that fork events are properly handled even if the fork operation fails and taking reference on fork\_nctx before releasing event\_wqh.lock
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry [1523481](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523481) provides more details including affected versions and the fix commit.
* The upstream fix commit [384632e67e0829deb8015ee6ad916b180049d252](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/384632e67e0829deb8015ee6ad916b180049d252) can be reviewed on github.
* The fix has also been backported to several Red Hat errata: RHSA-2018:0676 and RHSA-2018:1062.

In summary, this vulnerability allows a local user to cause a kernel DoS by exploiting a use-after-free condition within the `userfaultfd` subsystem, specifically related to fork events and shared huge pages. The fix focuses on properly managing the lifecycle of these fork events within the read context.
