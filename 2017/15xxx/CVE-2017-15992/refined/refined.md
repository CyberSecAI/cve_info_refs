- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `status_id` parameter in the `status_list.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject SQL commands directly into the query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or complete system compromise. The provided exploit examples demonstrate reading database information using `UNION SELECT` statements.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is reachable via a GET request to `status_list.php` with a malicious `status_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
