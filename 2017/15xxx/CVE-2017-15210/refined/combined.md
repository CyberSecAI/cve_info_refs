Fix:
<https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/074f6c104f3e49401ef0065540338fc2d4be79f0>
<https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/3e0f14ae2b0b5a44bd038a472f17eac75f538524>

<https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/7100f6de8a1f566e260b3e65312767e4cde112b1>

The issues are fixed in Kanboard 1.0.47.

<https://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.47>

Should I request a CVE ID for each issue or one CVE ID for all issues?

What is the recommended method?
