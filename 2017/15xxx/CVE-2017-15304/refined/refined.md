The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Airtame devices before version 3, including CVE-2017-15304.

**CVE-2017-15304: Session Fixation**

*   **Root cause:** The web panel's login functionality allows an attacker to set a custom session ID by modifying the `PHPSESSID` cookie in the login POST request. The application accepts this attacker-controlled session ID.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not generate a new session ID upon successful login, allowing an attacker to fixate a session ID.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who knows a valid admin password can set a custom session ID for the admin user. Even if the admin changes their password later, the attacker can still log in using the previously set session ID because it is not invalidated by the logout functionality.
*   **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious login request with a custom `PHPSESSID` value.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to know a valid admin password to gain initial access to set the session ID. After that, the attacker maintains access even if the admin user changes the password.

**Additional Vulnerabilities (Not CVE-2017-15304)**

*   **Updating Firmware via HTTP:** Firmware updates were downloaded over HTTP, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This means an attacker could intercept and modify the firmware during transmission.
*  **Using Weak Cryptographic Hash Function For File Integrity:** The application uses MD5 for file integrity checks, which is a weak cryptographic hash.
*  **Using Weak Cryptographic Hash Function For Storing Passwords:** User passwords are stored with MD5 hashes.
*   **Using Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded credentials for communicating with the server.
