## Vulnerability details

in recept.php line 41 allows SQL Injection via the id parameter

```
<?php
	$id=$_GET["id"];
	require_once("db.php");
	$query=mysql_query("SELECT recept FROM recept WHERE id_z=$id", $link) or die(mysql_error());
	$zag1=mysql_fetch_row($query);
	$zag=$zag1[0];
?>
<p><img src="images/<?php echo "$id" ?>.jpg" alt = "рецепт"><?php echo "$zag"?></p>

```

this code only check the file content-type. if attackers set content-type to image/jpeg can upload any file.for example php file

## poc
