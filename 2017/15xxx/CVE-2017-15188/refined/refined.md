The provided content relates to CVE-2017-15188.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of input sanitization when displaying hostnames and descriptions retrieved from a database. Specifically, the code in `module/admin_device/index.php` at line 222 does not filter the `$line[1]` (hostname) and `$line[2]` (description) values before outputting them within `<option>` tags, which are then rendered in the HTML select element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be stored in the database (if they have write access, or can manipulate existing entries). When an administrator views the affected page, the stored XSS payload will be executed in their browser. This allows for arbitrary script execution with the privileges of the administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have the ability to either create new entries or modify existing entries in the `host` table of the cacti database. This can be done through direct database access or via other vulnerable functionality that allows manipulation of the data used in the vulnerable page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control or manipulate the data stored in the `host` table of the `cacti` database to insert malicious script into the `hostname` or `description` fields. They need to have write access to the database, or be able to make use of a vulnerable feature/functionality that will lead to the payload being stored. The stored payload will then be executed when a user views the affected page.
- The administrator would then be a target for this injected Javascript and would need to access the admin panel with this vulnerability.
