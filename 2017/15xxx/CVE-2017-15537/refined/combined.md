## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security patch levels of 2018-01-05 or later address all issues associated with
the 2018-01-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels. To learn how
to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

**2. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**3. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**4. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**5. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and the
Android Security Bulletins?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in the Android Security Bulletins
are required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities, such as those documented in this
bulletin, are not required for declaring a security patch level.

x86/fpu: Don't let userspace set bogus xcomp\_bvOn x86, userspace can use the ptrace() or rt\_sigreturn() system calls to
set a task's extended state (xstate) or "FPU" registers. ptrace() can
set them for another task using the PTRACE\_SETREGSET request with
NT\_X86\_XSTATE, while rt\_sigreturn() can set them for the current task.
In either case, registers can be set to any value, but the kernel
assumes that the XSAVE area itself remains valid in the sense that the
CPU can restore it.
However, in the case where the kernel is using the uncompacted xstate
format (which it does whenever the XSAVES instruction is unavailable),
it was possible for userspace to set the xcomp\_bv field in the
xstate\_header to an arbitrary value. However, all bits in that field
are reserved in the uncompacted case, so when switching to a task with
nonzero xcomp\_bv, the XRSTOR instruction failed with a #GP fault. This
caused the WARN\_ON\_FPU(err) in copy\_kernel\_to\_xregs() to be hit. In
addition, since the error is otherwise ignored, the FPU registers from
the task previously executing on the CPU were leaked.
Fix the bug by checking that the user-supplied value of xcomp\_bv is 0 in
the uncompacted case, and returning an error otherwise.
The reason for validating xcomp\_bv rather than simply overwriting it
with 0 is that we want userspace to see an error if it (incorrectly)
provides an XSAVE area in compacted format rather than in uncompacted
format.
Note that as before, in case of error we clear the task's FPU state.
This is perhaps non-ideal, especially for PTRACE\_SETREGSET; it might be
better to return an error before changing anything. But it seems the
"clear on error" behavior is fine for now, and it's a little tricky to
do otherwise because it would mean we couldn't simply copy the full
userspace state into kernel memory in one \_\_copy\_from\_user().
This bug was found by syzkaller, which hit the above-mentioned
WARN\_ON\_FPU():

Here is a C reproducer. The expected behavior is that the program spin
forever with no output. However, on a buggy kernel running on a
processor with the "xsave" feature but without the "xsaves" feature
(e.g. Sandy Bridge through Broadwell for Intel), within a second or two
the program reports that the xmm registers were corrupted, i.e. were not
restored correctly. With CONFIG\_X86\_DEBUG\_FPU=y it also hits the above
kernel warning.

tracee = (fork() != 0);

printf("BUG: xmm registers corrupted! tracee=%d, xmm0=%08X%08X%08X%08X\n",
tracee, xmm0[0], xmm0[1], xmm0[2], xmm0[3]);
} else {

ptrace(PTRACE\_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);
wait(NULL);
ptrace(PTRACE\_GETREGSET, pid, NT\_X86\_XSTATE, &iov);
xstate[65] = -1;
ptrace(PTRACE\_SETREGSET, pid, NT\_X86\_XSTATE, &iov);
ptrace(PTRACE\_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
wait(NULL);
}
return 1;
}
Note: the program only tests for the bug using the ptrace() system call.
The bug can also be reproduced using the rt\_sigreturn() system call, but
only when called from a 32-bit program, since for 64-bit programs the
kernel restores the FPU state from the signal frame by doing XRSTOR
directly from userspace memory (with proper error checking).

x86/fpu: Don't let userspace set bogus xcomp\_bv

```
On x86, userspace can use the ptrace() or rt_sigreturn() system calls to
set a task's extended state (xstate) or "FPU" registers.  ptrace() can
set them for another task using the PTRACE_SETREGSET request with
NT_X86_XSTATE, while rt_sigreturn() can set them for the current task.
In either case, registers can be set to any value, but the kernel
assumes that the XSAVE area itself remains valid in the sense that the
CPU can restore it.

However, in the case where the kernel is using the uncompacted xstate
format (which it does whenever the XSAVES instruction is unavailable),
it was possible for userspace to set the xcomp_bv field in the
xstate_header to an arbitrary value.  However, all bits in that field
are reserved in the uncompacted case, so when switching to a task with
nonzero xcomp_bv, the XRSTOR instruction failed with a #GP fault.  This
caused the WARN_ON_FPU(err) in copy_kernel_to_xregs() to be hit.  In
addition, since the error is otherwise ignored, the FPU registers from
the task previously executing on the CPU were leaked.

Fix the bug by checking that the user-supplied value of xcomp_bv is 0 in
the uncompacted case, and returning an error otherwise.

The reason for validating xcomp_bv rather than simply overwriting it
with 0 is that we want userspace to see an error if it (incorrectly)
provides an XSAVE area in compacted format rather than in uncompacted
format.

Note that as before, in case of error we clear the task's FPU state.
This is perhaps non-ideal, especially for PTRACE_SETREGSET; it might be
better to return an error before changing anything.  But it seems the
"clear on error" behavior is fine for now, and it's a little tricky to
do otherwise because it would mean we couldn't simply copy the full
userspace state into kernel memory in one __copy_from_user().

This bug was found by syzkaller, which hit the above-mentioned
WARN_ON_FPU():

Here is a C reproducer.  The expected behavior is that the program spin
forever with no output.  However, on a buggy kernel running on a
processor with the "xsave" feature but without the "xsaves" feature
(e.g. Sandy Bridge through Broadwell for Intel), within a second or two
the program reports that the xmm registers were corrupted, i.e. were not
restored correctly.  With CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU=y it also hits the above
kernel warning.

        int pid = fork();
        uint64_t xstate[512];
        struct iovec iov = { .iov_base = xstate, .iov_len = sizeof(xstate) };

        if (pid == 0) {
            bool tracee = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) && tracee; i++)
                tracee = (fork() != 0);
            uint32_t xmm0[4] = { [0 ... 3] = tracee ? 0x00000000 : 0xDEADBEEF };
            asm volatile("   movdqu %0, %%xmm0\n"
                         "   mov %0, %%rbx\n"
                         "1: movdqu %%xmm0, %0\n"
                         "   mov %0, %%rax\n"
                         "   cmp %%rax, %%rbx\n"
                         "   je 1b\n"
                         : "+m" (xmm0) : : "rax", "rbx", "xmm0");
            printf("BUG: xmm registers corrupted!  tracee=%d, xmm0=%08X%08X%08X%08X\n",
                   tracee, xmm0[0], xmm0[1], xmm0[2], xmm0[3]);
        } else {
            usleep(100000);
            ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);
            wait(NULL);
            ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET, pid, NT_X86_XSTATE, &iov);
            xstate[65] = -1;
            ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGSET, pid, NT_X86_XSTATE, &iov);
            ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
            wait(NULL);
        }
        return 1;
    }

Note: the program only tests for the bug using the ptrace() system call.
The bug can also be reproduced using the rt_sigreturn() system call, but
only when called from a 32-bit program, since for 64-bit programs the
kernel restores the FPU state from the signal frame by doing XRSTOR
directly from userspace memory (with proper error checking).

x86/fpu: Don't let userspace set bogus xcomp\_bvOn x86, userspace can use the ptrace() or rt\_sigreturn() system calls to
set a task's extended state (xstate) or "FPU" registers. ptrace() can
set them for another task using the PTRACE\_SETREGSET request with
NT\_X86\_XSTATE, while rt\_sigreturn() can set them for the current task.
In either case, registers can be set to any value, but the kernel
assumes that the XSAVE area itself remains valid in the sense that the
CPU can restore it.
However, in the case where the kernel is using the uncompacted xstate
format (which it does whenever the XSAVES instruction is unavailable),
it was possible for userspace to set the xcomp\_bv field in the
xstate\_header to an arbitrary value. However, all bits in that field
are reserved in the uncompacted case, so when switching to a task with
nonzero xcomp\_bv, the XRSTOR instruction failed with a #GP fault. This
caused the WARN\_ON\_FPU(err) in copy\_kernel\_to\_xregs() to be hit. In
addition, since the error is otherwise ignored, the FPU registers from
the task previously executing on the CPU were leaked.
Fix the bug by checking that the user-supplied value of xcomp\_bv is 0 in
the uncompacted case, and returning an error otherwise.
The reason for validating xcomp\_bv rather than simply overwriting it
with 0 is that we want userspace to see an error if it (incorrectly)
provides an XSAVE area in compacted format rather than in uncompacted
format.
Note that as before, in case of error we clear the task's FPU state.
This is perhaps non-ideal, especially for PTRACE\_SETREGSET; it might be
better to return an error before changing anything. But it seems the
"clear on error" behavior is fine for now, and it's a little tricky to
do otherwise because it would mean we couldn't simply copy the full
userspace state into kernel memory in one \_\_copy\_from\_user().
This bug was found by syzkaller, which hit the above-mentioned

Here is a C reproducer. The expected behavior is that the program spin
forever with no output. However, on a buggy kernel running on a
processor with the "xsave" feature but without the "xsaves" feature
(e.g. Sandy Bridge through Broadwell for Intel), within a second or two
the program reports that the xmm registers were corrupted, i.e. were not
restored correctly. With CONFIG\_X86\_DEBUG\_FPU=y it also hits the above
kernel warning.

ptrace(PTRACE\_SETREGSET, pid, NT\_X86\_XSTATE, &iov);
ptrace(PTRACE\_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
wait(NULL);
}
return 1;
}
Note: the program only tests for the bug using the ptrace() system call.
The bug can also be reproduced using the rt\_sigreturn() system call, but
only when called from a 32-bit program, since for 64-bit programs the
kernel restores the FPU state from the signal frame by doing XRSTOR
directly from userspace memory (with proper error checking).

'clk' is copied to a userland with padding byte(s) after 'vclk\_post\_div'
field unitialized, leaking data from the stack. Fix this ensuring all of
'clk' is initialized to zero.

KVM: VMX: remove WARN\_ON\_ONCE in kvm\_vcpu\_trigger\_posted\_interrupt
commit 5753743fa5108b8f98bd61e40dc63f641b26c768 upstream.
WARN\_ON\_ONCE(pi\_test\_sn(&vmx->pi\_desc)) in kvm\_vcpu\_trigger\_posted\_interrupt()
intends to detect the violation of invariant that VT-d PI notification
event is not suppressed when vcpu is in the guest mode. Because the
two checks for the target vcpu mode and the target suppress field
cannot be performed atomically, the target vcpu mode may change in
between. If that does happen, WARN\_ON\_ONCE() here may raise false
alarms.
As the previous patch fixed the real invariant breaker, remove this
WARN\_ON\_ONCE() to avoid false alarms, and document the allowed cases
instead.

KVM: VMX: do not change SN bit in vmx\_update\_pi\_irte()
commit dc91f2eb1a4021eb6705c15e474942f84ab9b211 upstream.
In kvm\_vcpu\_trigger\_posted\_interrupt() and pi\_pre\_block(), KVM
assumes that PI notification events should not be suppressed when the
target vCPU is not blocked.
vmx\_update\_pi\_irte() sets the SN field before changing an interrupt
from posting to remapping, but it does not check the vCPU mode.
Therefore, the change of SN field may break above the assumption.
Besides, I don't see reasons to suppress notification events here, so
remove the changes of SN field to avoid race condition.

Here is a C reproducer. The expected behavior is that the program spin
forever with no output. However, on a buggy kernel running on a
processor with the "xsave" feature but without the "xsaves" feature
(e.g. Sandy Bridge through Broadwell for Intel), within a second or two
the program reports that the xmm registers were corrupted, i.e. were not
restored correctly. With CONFIG\_X86\_DEBUG\_FPU=y it also hits the above
kernel warning.

ptrace(PTRACE\_CONT, pid, 0, 0);

}
return 1;
}
Note: the program only tests for the bug using the ptrace() system call.
The bug can also be reproduced using the rt\_sigreturn() system call, but
only when called from a 32-bit program, since for 64-bit programs the
kernel restores the FPU state from the signal frame by doing XRSTOR
directly from userspace memory (with proper error checking).

x86/mm: Fix fault error path using unsafe vma pointer
commit a3c4fb7c9c2ebfd50b8c60f6c069932bb319bc37 upstream.
commit 7b2d0dbac489 ("x86/mm/pkeys: Pass VMA down in to fault signal
generation code") passes down a vma pointer to the error path, but that is
done once the mmap\_sem is released when calling mm\_fault\_error() from
\_\_do\_page\_fault().
This is dangerous as the vma structure is no more safe to be used once the
mmap\_sem has been released. As only the protection key value is required in
the error processing, we could just pass down this value.
Fix it by passing a pointer to a protection key value down to the fault
signal generation code. The use of a pointer allows to keep the check
generating a warning message in fill\_sig\_info\_pkey() when the vma was not
known. If the pointer is valid, the protection value can be accessed by
deferencing the pointer.
[ tglx: Made \*pkey u32 as that's the type which is passed in siginfo ]

PM / OPP: Call notifier without holding opp\_table->lock
commit e4d8ae00169f7686e1da5a62e5cf797d12bf8822 upstream.
The notifier callbacks may want to call some OPP helper routines which
may try to take the same opp\_table->lock again and cause a deadlock. One
such usecase was reported by Chanwoo Choi, where calling
dev\_pm\_opp\_disable() leads us to the devfreq's OPP notifier handler,
which further calls dev\_pm\_opp\_find\_freq\_floor() and it deadlocks.
We don't really need the opp\_table->lock to be held across the notifier
call though, all we want to make sure is that the 'opp' doesn't get
freed while being used from within the notifier chain. We can do it with
help of dev\_pm\_opp\_get/put() as well. Let's do it.

btrfs: finish ordered extent cleaning if no progress is found
commit 67c003f90fd68062d92a7ffade36f9b2a9098bd8 upstream.
\_\_endio\_write\_update\_ordered() repeats the search until it reaches the end
of the specified range. This works well with direct IO path, because before
the function is called, it's ensured that there are ordered extents filling
whole the range. It's not the case, however, when it's called from
run\_delalloc\_range(): it is possible to have error in the midle of the loop
in e.g. run\_delalloc\_nocow(), so that there exisits the range not covered
by any ordered extents. By cleaning such "uncomplete" range,
\_\_endio\_write\_update\_ordered() stucks at offset where there're no ordered
extents.
Since the ordered extents are created from head to tail, we can stop the
search if there are no offset progress.

futex: Fix pi\_state->owner serialization
commit c74aef2d06a9f59cece89093eecc552933cba72a upstream.
There was a reported suspicion about a race between exit\_pi\_state\_list()
and put\_pi\_state(). The same report mentioned the comment with
put\_pi\_state() said it should be called with hb->lock held, and it no
longer is in all places.
As it turns out, the pi\_state->owner serialization is indeed broken. As per
the new rules:
734009e96d19 ("futex: Change locking rules")
pi\_state->owner should be serialized by pi\_state->pi\_mutex.wait\_lock.
For the sites setting pi\_state->owner we already hold wait\_lock (where
required) but exit\_pi\_state\_list() and put\_pi\_state() were not and
raced on clearing it.

commit 72364d320644c12948786962673772f271039a4a upstream.
When generic irq chips are allocated for an irq domain the domain name is
set to the irq chip name. That was done to have named domains before the
recent changes which enforce domain naming were done.
Since then the overwrite causes a memory leak when the domain name is
dynamically allocated and even worse it would cause the domain free code to
free the wrong name pointer, which might point to a constant.
Remove the name assignment to prevent this.

fix infoleak in waitid(2)
commit 6c85501f2fabcfc4fc6ed976543d252c4eaf4be9 upstream.
kernel\_waitid() can return a PID, an error or 0. rusage is filled in the first
case and waitid(2) rusage should've been copied out exactly in that case, \*not\*
whenever kernel\_waitid() has not returned an error. Compat variant shares that
braino; none of kernel\_wait4() callers do, so the below ought to fix it.

xfs: validate bdev support for DAX inode flag
commit 6851a3db7e224bbb85e23b3c64a506c9e0904382 upstream.
Currently only the blocksize is checked, but we should really be calling
bdev\_dax\_supported() which also tests to make sure we can get a
struct dax\_device and that the dax\_direct\_access() path is working.
This is the same check that we do for the "-o dax" mount option in
xfs\_fs\_fill\_super().
This does not fix the race issues that caused the XFS DAX inode option to
be disabled, so that option will still be disabled. If/when we re-enable
it, though, I think we will want this issue to have been fixed. I also do
think that we want to fix this in stable kernels.

KVM: VMX: Do not BUG() on out-of-bounds guest IRQ
commit 3a8b0677fc6180a467e26cc32ce6b0c09a32f9bb upstream.
The value of the guest\_irq argument to vmx\_update\_pi\_irte() is
ultimately coming from a KVM\_IRQFD API call. Do not BUG() in
vmx\_update\_pi\_irte() if the value is out-of bounds. (Especially,
since KVM as a whole seems to hang after that.)
Instead, print a message only once if we find that we don't have a

This happened when the host hit a page fault, and delivered it as in an
async page fault, while the guest was in an RCU read-side critical
section. The guest then tries to reschedule in kvm\_async\_pf\_task\_wait(),
but rcu\_preempt\_note\_context\_switch() would treat the reschedule as a
sleep in RCU read-side critical section, which is not allowed (even in
preemptible RCU). Thus the WARN.
To cure this, make kvm\_async\_pf\_task\_wait() go to the halt path if the
PF happens in a RCU read-side critical section.

KVM: nVMX: fix HOST\_CR3/HOST\_CR4 cache
commit 44889942b6eb356eab27ce25fe10701adfec7776 upstream.
For nested virt we maintain multiple VMCS that can run on a vCPU. So it is
incorrect to keep vmcs\_host\_cr3 and vmcs\_host\_cr4, whose purpose is caching
the value of the rarely changing HOST\_CR3 and HOST\_CR4 VMCS fields, in
vCPU-wide data structures.
Hyper-V nested on KVM runs into this consistently for me with PCID enabled.
CR3 is updated with a new value, unlikely(cr3 != vmx->host\_state.vmcs\_host\_cr3)
fires, and the currently loaded VMCS is updated. Then we switch from L2 to
L1 and the next exit reverts CR3 to its old value.

The fix part: do not check kvm\_arch\_has\_assigned\_device, instead
check the SN bit to figure out whether vmx\_vcpu\_pi\_put ran before.
This matches what the previous patch did in pi\_post\_block.

KVM: VMX: avoid double list add with VT-d posted interrupts
commit 8b306e2f3c41939ea528e6174c88cfbfff893ce1 upstream.
In some cases, for example involving hot-unplug of assigned
devices, pi\_post\_block can forget to remove the vCPU from the
blocked\_vcpu\_list. When this happens, the next call to
pi\_pre\_block corrupts the list.
Fix this in two ways. First, check vcpu->pre\_pcpu in pi\_pre\_block
and WARN instead of adding the element twice in the list. Second,
always do the list removal in pi\_post\_block if vcpu->pre\_pcpu is
set (not -1).
The new code keeps interrupts disabled for the whole duration of
pi\_pre\_block/pi\_post\_block. This is not strictly necessary, but
easier to follow. For the same reason, PI.ON is checked only
after the cmpxchg, and to handle it we just call the post-block
code. This removes duplication of the list removal code.

arm64: fault: Route pte translation faults via do\_translation\_fault
commit 760bfb47c36a07741a089bf6a28e854ffbee7dc9 upstream.
We currently route pte translation faults via do\_page\_fault, which elides
the address check against TASK\_SIZE before invoking the mm fault handling
code. However, this can cause issues with the path walking code in
conjunction with our word-at-a-time implementation because
load\_unaligned\_zeropad can end up faulting in kernel space if it reads
across a page boundary and runs into a page fault (e.g. by attempting to
read from a guard region).
In the case of such a fault, load\_unaligned\_zeropad has registered a
fixup to shift the valid data and pad with zeroes, however the abort is
reported as a level 3 translation fault and we dispatch it straight to
do\_page\_fault, despite it being a kernel address. This results in calling
a sleeping function from atomic context:
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at arch/arm64/mm/fault.c:313

arm64: mm: Use READ\_ONCE when dereferencing pointer to pte table
commit f069faba688701c4d56b6c3452a130f97bf02e95 upstream.
On kernels built with support for transparent huge pages, different CPUs
can access the PMD concurrently due to e.g. fast GUP or page\_vma\_mapped\_walk
and they must take care to use READ\_ONCE to avoid value tearing or caching
of stale values by the compiler. Unfortunately, these functions call into
our pgtable macros, which don't use READ\_ONCE, and compiler caching has
been observed to cause the following crash during ext4 writeback:
PC is at check\_pte+0x20/0x170
LR is at page\_vma\_mapped\_walk+0x2e0/0x540
[...]
Process doio (pid: 2463, stack limit = 0xffff00000f2e8000)
Call trace:
[] check\_pte+0x20/0x170

[] vfs\_fsync\_range+0x64/0xc0
[] SyS\_msync+0x194/0x1e8
This is because page\_vma\_mapped\_walk loads the PMD twice before calling
pte\_offset\_map: the first time without READ\_ONCE (where it gets all zeroes
due to a concurrent pmdp\_invalidate) and the second time with READ\_ONCE
(where it sees a valid table pointer due to a concurrent pmd\_populate).
However, the compiler inlines everything and caches the first value in
a register, which is subsequently used in pte\_offset\_phys which returns
a junk pointer that is later dereferenced when attempting to access the
relevant pte.
This patch fixes the issue by using READ\_ONCE in pte\_offset\_phys to ensure
that a stale value is not used. Whilst this is a point fix for a known
failure (and simple to backport), a full fix moving all of our page table
accessors over to {READ,WRITE}\_ONCE and consistently using READ\_ONCE in
page\_vma\_mapped\_walk is in the works for a future kernel release.

arm64: Make sure SPsel is always set
commit 5371513fb338fb9989c569dc071326d369d6ade8 upstream.
When the kernel is entered at EL2 on an ARMv8.0 system, we construct
the EL1 pstate and make sure this uses the the EL1 stack pointer
(we perform an exception return to EL1h).
But if the kernel is either entered at EL1 or stays at EL2 (because
we're on a VHE-capable system), we fail to set SPsel, and use whatever
stack selection the higher exception level has choosen for us.
Let's not take any chance, and make sure that SPsel is set to one
before we decide the mode we're going to run in.

extable: Enable RCU if it is not watching in kernel\_text\_address()
commit e8cac8b1d10589be45671a5ade0926a639b543b7 upstream.
If kernel\_text\_address() is called when RCU is not watching, it can cause an
RCU bug because is\_module\_text\_address(), the is\_kprobe\_\*insn\_slot()
and is\_bpf\_text\_address() functions require the use of RCU.
Only enable RCU if it is not currently watching before it calls
is\_module\_text\_address(). The use of rcu\_nmi\_enter() is used to enable RCU
because kernel\_text\_address() can happen pretty much anywhere (like an NMI),
and even from within an NMI. It is called via save\_stack\_trace() that can be
called by any WARN() or tracing function, which can happen while RCU is not
watching (for example, going to or coming from idle, or during CPU take down
or bring up).

commit 9aadde91b3c035413c806619beb3e3ef6e697953 upstream.
The functionality between kernel\_text\_address() and \_kernel\_text\_address()
is the same except that \_kernel\_text\_address() does a little more (that
function needs a rename, but that can be done another time). Instead of
having duplicate code in both, simply have \_kernel\_text\_address() calls
kernel\_text\_address() instead.
This is marked for stable because there's an RCU bug that can happen if
one of these functions gets called while RCU is not watching. That fix
depends on this fix to keep from having to write the fix twice.

commit 28585a832602747cbfa88ad8934013177a3aae38 upstream.
A number of architecture invoke rcu\_irq\_enter() on exception entry in
order to allow RCU read-side critical sections in the exception handler
when the exception is from an idle or nohz\_full CPU. This works, at
least unless the exception happens in an NMI handler. In that case,
rcu\_nmi\_enter() would already have exited the extended quiescent state,
which would mean that rcu\_irq\_enter() would (incorrectly) cause RCU
to think that it is again in an extended quiescent state. This will
in turn result in lockdep splats in response to later RCU read-side
critical sections.
This commit therefore causes rcu\_irq\_enter() and rcu\_irq\_exit() to
take no action if there is an rcu\_nmi\_enter() in effect, thus avoiding
the unscheduled return to RCU quiescent state. This in turn should
make the kernel safe for on-demand RCU voyeurism.

libceph: don't allow bidirectional swap of pg-upmap-items
commit 29a0cfbf91ba997591535a4f7246835ce8328141 upstream.
This reverts most of commit f53b7665c8ce ("libceph: upmap semantic
changes").
We need to prevent duplicates in the final result. For example, we
can currently take
[1,2,3] and apply [(1,2)] and get [2,2,3]
or
[1,2,3] and apply [(3,2)] and get [1,2,2]
The rest of the system is not prepared to handle duplicates in the
result set like this.
The reverted piece was intended to allow
[1,2,3] and [(1,2),(2,1)] to get [2,1,3]
to reorder primaries. First, this bidirectional swap is hard to
implement in a way that also prevents dups. For example, [1,2,3] and
[(1,4),(2,3),(3,4)] would give [4,3,4] but would we just drop the last
step we'd have [4,3,3] which is also invalid, etc. Simpler to just not
handle bidirectional swaps. In practice, they are not needed: if you
just want to choose a different primary then use primary\_affinity, or
pg\_upmap (not pg\_upmap\_items).

Core qp->usecnt will never go down, so ib\_destroy\_qp() will fail.

pkey by destroying an old mcast object in ipoib\_mcast\_dev\_flush())

MIPS: Fix perf event init
commit fd0b19ed5389187829b854900511c9195875bb42 upstream.
Commit c311c797998c ("cpumask: make "nr\_cpumask\_bits" unsigned")
modified mipspmu\_event\_init() to cast the struct perf\_event cpu field to
an unsigned integer before it is compared with nr\_cpumask\_bits (and
\*ahem\* did so without copying the linux-mips mailing list or any MIPS
developers...). This is broken because the cpu field may be -1 for
events which follow a process rather than being affine to a particular
CPU. When this is the case the cast to an unsigned int results in a
value equal to ULONG\_MAX, which is always greater than nr\_cpumask\_bits
so we always fail mipspmu\_event\_init() and return -ENODEV.
The check against nr\_cpumask\_bits seems nonsensical anyway, so this
patch simply removes it. The cpu field is going to either be -1 or a
valid CPU number. Comparing it with nr\_cpumask\_bits is effectively
checking that it's a valid cpu number, but it seems safe to rely on the
core perf events code to ensure that's the case.
The end result is that this fixes use of perf on MIPS when not
constraining events to a particular CPU, and fixes the "perf list hw"
command which fails to list any events without this.

powerpc/tm: Flush TM only if CPU has TM feature
commit c1fa0768a8713b135848f78fd43ffc208d8ded70 upstream.
Commit cd63f3c ("powerpc/tm: Fix saving of TM SPRs in core dump")
added code to access TM SPRs in flush\_tmregs\_to\_thread(). However
flush\_tmregs\_to\_thread() does not check if TM feature is available on
CPU before trying to access TM SPRs in order to copy live state to
thread structures. flush\_tmregs\_to\_thread() is indeed guarded by
CONFIG\_PPC\_TRANSACTIONAL\_MEM but it might be the case that kernel
was compiled with CONFIG\_PPC\_TRANSACTIONAL\_MEM enabled and ran on
a CPU without TM feature available, thus rendering the execution
of TM instructions that are treated by the CPU as illegal instructions.
The fix is just to add proper checking in flush\_tmregs\_to\_thread()
if CPU has the TM feature before accessing any TM-specific resource,
returning immediately if TM is no available on the CPU. Adding
that checking in flush\_tmregs\_to\_thread() instead of in places
where it is called, like in vsr\_get() and vsr\_set(), is better because
avoids the same problem cropping up elsewhere.

KEYS: prevent KEYCTL\_READ on negative key
commit 37863c43b2c6464f252862bf2e9768264e961678 upstream.
Because keyctl\_read\_key() looks up the key with no permissions
requested, it may find a negatively instantiated key. If the key is
also possessed, we went ahead and called ->read() on the key. But the
key payload will actually contain the ->reject\_error rather than the
normal payload. Thus, the kernel oopses trying to read the
user\_key\_payload from memory address (int)-ENOKEY = 0x00000000ffffff82.
Fortunately the payload data is stored inline, so it shouldn't be
possible to abuse this as an arbitrary memory read primitive...
Reproducer:
keyctl new\_session
keyctl request2 user desc '' @s
keyctl read $(keyctl show | awk '/user: desc/ {print $1}')
It causes a crash like the following:

KEYS: prevent creating a different user's keyrings
commit 237bbd29f7a049d310d907f4b2716a7feef9abf3 upstream.
It was possible for an unprivileged user to create the user and user
session keyrings for another user. For example:
sudo -u '#3000' sh -c 'keyctl add keyring \_uid.4000 "" @u
keyctl add keyring \_uid\_ses.4000 "" @u
sleep 15' &
sleep 1
sudo -u '#4000' keyctl describe @u
sudo -u '#4000' keyctl describe @us
This is problematic because these "fake" keyrings won't have the right
permissions. In particular, the user who created them first will own
them and will have full access to them via the possessor permissions,
which can be used to compromise the security of a user's keys:
-4: alswrv-----v------------ 3000 0 keyring: \_uid.4000
-5: alswrv-----v------------ 3000 0 keyring: \_uid\_ses.4000
Fix it by marking user and user session keyrings with a flag
KEY\_FLAG\_UID\_KEYRING. Then, when searching for a user or user session
keyring by name, skip all keyrings that don't have the flag set.

KEYS: fix writing past end of user-supplied buffer in keyring\_read()
commit e645016abc803dafc75e4b8f6e4118f088900ffb upstream.
Userspace can call keyctl\_read() on a keyring to get the list of IDs of
keys in the keyring. But if the user-supplied buffer is too small, the
kernel would write the full list anyway --- which will corrupt whatever
userspace memory happened to be past the end of the buffer. Fix it by
only filling the space that is available.

security/keys: rewrite all of big\_key crypto
commit 428490e38b2e352812e0b765d8bceafab0ec441d upstream.
This started out as just replacing the use of crypto/rng with
get\_random\_bytes\_wait, so that we wouldn't use bad randomness at boot
time. But, upon looking further, it appears that there were even deeper
underlying cryptographic problems, and that this seems to have been
committed with very little crypto review. So, I rewrote the whole thing,
trying to keep to the conventions introduced by the previous author, to
fix these cryptographic flaws.
It makes no sense to seed crypto/rng at boot time and then keep
using it like this, when in fact there's already get\_random\_bytes\_wait,
which can ensure there's enough entropy and be a much more standard way
of generating keys. Since this sensitive material is being stored
untrusted, using ECB and no authentication is simply not okay at all. I
find it surprising and a bit horrifying that this code even made it past
basic crypto review, which perhaps points to some larger issues. This
patch moves from using AES-ECB to using AES-GCM. Since keys are uniquely
generated each time, we can set the nonce to zero. There was also a race
condition in which the same key would be reused at the same time in
different threads. A mutex fixes this issue now.
So, to summarize, this commit fixes the following vulnerabilities:
\* Low entropy key generation, allowing an attacker to potentially
guess or predict keys.
\* Unauthenticated encryption, allowing an attacker to modify the
cipher text in particular ways in order to manipulate the plaintext,
which is is even more frightening considering the next point.
\* Use of ECB mode, allowing an attacker to trivially swap blocks or
compare identical plaintext blocks.
\* Key re-use.
\* Faulty memory zeroing.

drm/amdgpu: revert tile table update for oland
commit 4cf97582b46f123a4b7cd88d999f1806c2eb4093 upstream.
Several users have complained that the tile table update broke Oland
support. Despite several attempts to fix it, the root cause is still
unknown at this point and no solution is available. As it is not
acceptable to leave a known regression breaking a major functionality
in the kernel for several releases, let's just reverse this
optimization for now. It can be implemented again later if and only
if the breakage is understood and fixed.
As there were no complaints for Hainan so far, only the Oland part of
the offending commit is reverted. Optimization is preserved on
Hainan, so this commit isn't an actual revert of the original.

Disable device ready before shutdown command was added previously to

link is not supported and will need some rework in the upstream
code. For single link DSI panels, the change is not required. This will
cause failure in sending SHUTDOWN packet during disable. Hence reverting

drm/i915/gvt: Fix incorrect PCI BARs reporting
commit 7b4dc3c0da0d66e7b20a826c537d41bb73e4df54 upstream.
Looking at our virtual PCI device, we can see surprising Region 4 and Region 5.
00:10.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Sky Lake Integrated Graphics (rev 06) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
....
Region 0: Memory at 140000000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
Region 2: Memory at 180000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=1G]
Region 4: Memory at  (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
Region 5: Memory at  (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
Expansion ROM at febd6000 [disabled] [size=2K]
The fact is that we only implemented BAR0 and BAR2. Surprising Region 4 and
Region 5 are shown because we report their size as 0xffffffff. They should
report size 0 instead.
BTW, the physical GPU has a PIO BAR. GVTg hasn't implemented PIO access, so
we ignored this BAR for vGPU device.
v2: fix BAR size value calculation.

scsi: aacraid: Add a small delay after IOP reset
commit d1b490939d8c117a06dfc562c41d933f71d30289 upstream.
Commit 0e9973ed3382 ("scsi: aacraid: Add periodic checks to see IOP reset
status") changed the way driver checks if a reset succeeded. Now, after an
IOP reset, aacraid immediately start polling a register to verify the reset
is complete.
This behavior cause regressions on the reset path in PowerPC (at least).
Since the delay after the IOP reset was removed by the aforementioned patch,
the fact driver just starts to read a register instantly after the reset
was issued (by writing in another register) "corrupts" the reset procedure,
which ends up failing all the time.
The issue highly impacted kdump on PowerPC, since on kdump path we
proactively issue a reset in adapter (through the reset\_devices kernel
parameter).
This patch (re-)adds a delay right after IOP reset is issued. Empirically
we measured that 3 seconds is enough, but for safety reasons we delay
for 5s (and since it was 30s before, 5s is still a small amount).
For reference, without this patch we observe the following messages
on kdump kernel boot process:
[ 76.294] aacraid 0003:01:00.0: IOP reset failed

md/raid5: preserve STRIPE\_ON\_UNPLUG\_LIST in break\_stripe\_batch\_list
commit 184a09eb9a2fe425e49c9538f1604b05ed33cfef upstream.
In release\_stripe\_plug(), if a stripe\_head has its STRIPE\_ON\_UNPLUG\_LIST
set, it indicates that this stripe\_head is already in the raid5\_plug\_cb
list and release\_stripe() would be called instead to drop a reference
count. Otherwise, the STRIPE\_ON\_UNPLUG\_LIST bit would be set for this
stripe\_head and it will get queued into the raid5\_plug\_cb list.
Since break\_stripe\_batch\_list() did not preserve STRIPE\_ON\_UNPLUG\_LIST,
A stripe could be re-added to plug list while it is still on that list
in the following situation. If stripe\_head A is added to another
stripe\_head B's batch list, in this case A will have its
batch\_head != NULL and be added into the plug list. After that,
stripe\_head B gets handled and called break\_stripe\_batch\_list() to
reset all the batched stripe\_head(including A which is still on
the plug list)'s state and reset their batch\_head to NULL.
Before the plug list gets processed, if there is another write request
comes in and get stripe\_head A, A will have its batch\_head == NULL
(cleared by calling break\_stripe\_batch\_list() on B) and be added to
plug list once again.

md/raid5: fix a race condition in stripe batch
commit 3664847d95e60a9a943858b7800f8484669740fc upstream.
We have a race condition in below scenario, say have 3 continuous stripes, sh1,
sh2 and sh3, sh1 is the stripe\_head of sh2 and sh3:
CPU1 CPU2 CPU3
handle\_stripe(sh3)
stripe\_add\_to\_batch\_list(sh3)
-> lock(sh2, sh3)
-> lock batch\_lock(sh1)
-> add sh3 to batch\_list of sh1
-> unlock batch\_lock(sh1)
clear\_batch\_ready(sh1)
-> lock(sh1) and batch\_lock(sh1)
-> clear STRIPE\_BATCH\_READY for all stripes in batch\_list
-> unlock(sh1) and batch\_lock(sh1)
->clear\_batch\_ready(sh3)
-->test\_and\_clear\_bit(STRIPE\_BATCH\_READY, sh3)
--->return 0 as sh->batch == NULL
-> sh3->batch\_head = sh1
-> unlock (sh2, sh3)
In CPU1, handle\_stripe will continue handle sh3 even it's in batch stripe list
of sh1. By moving sh3->batch\_head assignment in to batch\_lock, we make it
impossible to clear STRIPE\_BATCH\_READY before batch\_head is set.

tracing: Remove RCU work arounds from stack tracer
commit 15516c89acce948debc4c598e03c3fee53045797 upstream.
Currently the stack tracer calls rcu\_irq\_enter() to make sure RCU
is watching when it records a stack trace. But if the stack tracer
is triggered while tracing inside of a rcu\_irq\_enter(), calling
rcu\_irq\_enter() unconditionally can be problematic.
The reason for having rcu\_irq\_enter() in the first place has been
fixed from within the saving of the stack trace code, and there's no
reason for doing it in the stack tracer itself. Just remove it.

commit 8dd33bcb7050dd6f8c1432732f930932c9d3a33e upstream.
One convenient way to erase trace is "echo > trace". However, this
is currently broken if the current tracer is irqsoff tracer. This
is because irqsoff tracer use max\_buffer as the default trace
buffer.
Set the max\_buffer as the one to be cleared when it's the trace
buffer currently in use.

tracing: Fix trace\_pipe behavior for instance traces
commit 75df6e688ccd517e339a7c422ef7ad73045b18a2 upstream.
When reading data from trace\_pipe, tracing\_wait\_pipe() performs a
check to see if tracing has been turned off after some data was read.
Currently, this check always looks at global trace state, but it
should be checking the trace instance where trace\_pipe is located at.
Because of this bug, cat instances/i1/trace\_pipe in the following
script will immediately exit instead of waiting for data:
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
echo 0 > tracing\_on
mkdir -p instances/i1

It turns out that what has happened is that the SLB entry for the
vmmemap region hasn't been reloaded on exit from a guest, and it has
the wrong page size. Then, when the host next accesses the vmemmap
region, it gets a page fault.
Commit a25bd72badfa ("powerpc/mm/radix: Workaround prefetch issue with
KVM", 2017-07-24) modified the guest exit code so that it now only clears
out the SLB for hash guest. The code tests the radix flag and puts the
result in a non-volatile CR field, CR2, and later branches based on CR2.
Unfortunately, the kvmppc\_save\_tm function, which gets called between
those two points, modifies all the user-visible registers in the case
where the guest was in transactional or suspended state, except for a
few which it restores (namely r1, r2, r9 and r13). Thus the hash/radix indication in CR2 gets corrupted.
This fixes the problem by re-doing the comparison just before the
result is needed. For good measure, this also adds comments next to
the call sites of kvmppc\_save\_tm and kvmppc\_restore\_tm pointing out
that non-volatile register state will be lost.

Commit 468808bd35c4 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Set process table for HPT

the kvmppc\_setup\_partition\_table() call in the locked region, since
it is altering global state of the VM.
This error appears not to have any fatal consequences for the host;
the consequences would be that the VCPUs could end up running with
different LPCR values, or an update to the LPCR value by userspace
using the one\_reg interface could get overwritten, or the update
done by kvmhv\_configure\_mmu() could get overwritten.

genirq/msi: Fix populating multiple interrupts
commit 596a7a1d0989c621c3ae49be73a1d1f9de22eb5a upstream.
On allocating the interrupts routed via a wire-to-MSI bridge, the allocator
iterates over the MSI descriptors to build the hierarchy, but fails to use
the descriptor interrupt number, and instead uses the base number,
generating the wrong IRQ domain mappings.
The fix is to use the MSI descriptor interrupt number when setting up
the interrupt instead of the base interrupt for the allocation range.
The only saving grace is that although the MSI descriptors are allocated
in bulk, the wired interrupts are only allocated one by one (so
desc->irq == virq) and the bug went unnoticed so far.

genirq: Make sparse\_irq\_lock protect what it should protect
commit 12ac1d0f6c3e95732d144ffa65c8b20fbd9aa462 upstream.
for\_each\_active\_irq() iterates the sparse irq allocation bitmap. The caller
must hold sparse\_irq\_lock. Several code pathes expect that an active bit in
the sparse bitmap also has a valid interrupt descriptor.
Unfortunately that's not true. The (de)allocation is a two step process,
which holds the sparse\_irq\_lock only across the queue/remove from the radix
tree and the set/clear in the allocation bitmap.
If a iteration locks sparse\_irq\_lock between the two steps, then it might
see an active bit but the corresponding irq descriptor is NULL. If that is
dereferenced unconditionally, then the kernel oopses. Of course, all
iterator sites could be audited and fixed, but....
There is no reason why the sparse\_irq\_lock needs to be dropped between the
two steps, in fact the code becomes simpler when the mutex is held across
both and the semantics become more straight forward, so future problems of
missing NULL pointer checks in the iteration are avoided and all existing
sites are fixed in one go.
Expand the lock held sections so both operations are covered and the bitmap
and the radixtree are in sync.

When an RX BA session is started by the driver, and it has to tell

set and the BA session work is scheduled. Upon testing this bit, it
will call \_\_ieee80211\_start\_rx\_ba\_session(), thus deadlocking as it
already holds the ampdu\_mlme.mtx, which that acquires again.
Fix this by adding \_\_\_ieee80211\_start\_rx\_ba\_session(), a version of

mac80211: flush hw\_roc\_start work before cancelling the ROC
commit 6e46d8ce894374fc135c96a8d1057c6af1fef237 upstream.
When HW ROC is supported it is possible that after the HW notified
that the ROC has started, the ROC was cancelled and another ROC was
added while the hw\_roc\_start worker is waiting on the mutex (since
cancelling the ROC and adding another one also holds the same mutex).
As a result, the hw\_roc\_start worker will continue to run after the
new ROC is added but before it is actually started by the HW.
This may result in notifying userspace that the ROC has started before
it actually does, or in case of management tx ROC, in an attempt to
tx while not on the right channel.
In addition, when the driver will notify mac80211 that the second ROC
has started, mac80211 will warn that this ROC has already been
notified.
Fix this by flushing the hw\_roc\_start work before cancelling an ROC.

mac80211\_hwsim: Use proper TX power
commit 9de981f507474f326e42117858dc9a9321331ae5 upstream.
In struct ieee80211\_tx\_info, control.vif pointer and rate\_driver\_data[0]
falls on the same place, depending on the union usage.
During the whole TX process, the union is referred to as a control struct,
which holds the vif that is later used in the tx flow, especially in order
to derive the used tx power.
Referring direcly to rate\_driver\_data[0] and assigning a value to it,
overwrites the vif pointer, hence making all later references irrelevant.
Moreover, rate\_driver\_data[0] isn't used later in the flow in order to
retrieve the channel that it is pointing to.

commit 53168215909281a09d3afc6fb51a9d4f81f74d39 upstream.
With TXQs, the AP\_VLAN interfaces are resolved to their owner AP
interface when enqueuing the frame, which makes sense since the
frame really goes out on that as far as the driver is concerned.
However, this introduces a problem: frames to be encrypted with
a VLAN-specific GTK will now be encrypted with the AP GTK, since
the information about which virtual interface to use to select
the key is taken from the TXQ.
Fix this by preserving info->control.vif and using that in the
dequeue function. This now requires doing the driver-mapping
in the dequeue as well.
Since there's no way to filter the frames that are sitting on a
TXQ, drop all frames, which may affect other interfaces, when an
AP\_VLAN is removed.

SMB3: Add support for multidialect negotiate (SMB2.1 and later)
commit 9764c02fcbad40001fd3f63558d918e4d519bb75 upstream.
With the need to discourage use of less secure dialect, SMB1 (CIFS),
we temporarily upgraded the dialect to SMB3 in 4.13, but since there
are various servers which only support SMB2.1 (2.1 is more secure
than CIFS/SMB1) but not optimal for a default dialect - add support
for multidialect negotiation. cifs.ko will now request SMB2.1
or later (ie SMB2.1 or SMB3.0, SMB3.02) and the server will
pick the latest most secure one it can support.
In addition since we are sending multidialect negotiate, add
support for secure negotiate to validate that a man in the
middle didn't downgrade us.

fs/proc: Report eip/esp in /prod/PID/stat for coredumping
commit fd7d56270b526ca3ed0c224362e3c64a0f86687a upstream.
Commit 0a1eb2d474ed ("fs/proc: Stop reporting eip and esp in
/proc/PID/stat") stopped reporting eip/esp because it is
racy and dangerous for executing tasks. The comment adds:
As far as I know, there are no use programs that make any
material use of these fields, so just get rid of them.
However, existing userspace core-dump-handler applications (for
example, minicoredumper) are using these fields since they
provide an excellent cross-platform interface to these valuable
pointers. So that commit introduced a user space visible
regression.
Partially revert the change and make the readout possible for
tasks with the proper permissions and only if the target task
has the PF\_DUMPCORE flag set.

Even though read operations fail, dm\_integrity\_map\_continue() calls

This also makes it so read I/O errors do not generate integrity warnings

dax: remove the pmem\_dax\_ops->flush abstraction
commit c3ca015fab6df124c933b91902f3f2a3473f9da5 upstream.
Commit abebfbe2f731 ("dm: add ->flush() dax operation support") is
buggy. A DM device may be composed of multiple underlying devices and
all of them need to be flushed. That commit just routes the flush
request to the first device and ignores the other devices.
It could be fixed by adding more complex logic to the device mapper. But
there is only one implementation of the method pmem\_dax\_ops->flush - that
is pmem\_dax\_flush() - and it calls arch\_wb\_cache\_pmem(). Consequently, we
don't need the pmem\_dax\_ops->flush abstraction at all, we can call
arch\_wb\_cache\_pmem() directly from dax\_flush() because dax\_dev->ops->flush
can't ever reach anything different from arch\_wb\_cache\_pmem().
It should be also pointed out that for some uses of persistent memory it
is needed to flush only a very small amount of data (such as 1 cacheline),
and it would be overkill if we go through that device mapper machinery for
a single flushed cache line.
Fix this by removing the pmem\_dax\_ops->flush abstraction and call
arch\_wb\_cache\_pmem() directly from dax\_flush(). Also, remove the device
mapper code that forwards the flushes.

The initial chunk size for host memory buffer allocation is currently
PAGE\_SIZE << MAX\_ORDER. MAX\_ORDER order allocation is usually failed
without CONFIG\_DMA\_CMA. So the HMB allocation is retried with chunk size
PAGE\_SIZE << (MAX\_ORDER - 1) in general, but there is no problem if the
retry allocation works correctly.

cifs: release auth\_key.response for reconnect.
commit f5c4ba816315d3b813af16f5571f86c8d4e897bd upstream.
There is a race that cause cifs reconnect in cifs\_mount,
- cifs\_mount
- cifs\_get\_tcp\_session
- [ start thread cifs\_demultiplex\_thread
- cifs\_read\_from\_socket: -ECONNABORTED
- DELAY\_WORK smb2\_reconnect\_server ]
- cifs\_setup\_session
- [ smb2\_reconnect\_server ]
auth\_key.response was allocated in cifs\_setup\_session, and
will release when the session destoried. So when session re-
connect, auth\_key.response should be check and released.
Tested with my system:
CIFS VFS: Free previous auth\_key.response = ffff8800320bbf80
A simple auth\_key.response allocation call trace:
- cifs\_setup\_session
- SMB2\_sess\_setup

Sanitize 'move\_pages()' permission checksThe 'move\_paghes()' system call was introduced long long ago with the
same permission checks as for sending a signal (except using
CAP\_SYS\_NICE instead of CAP\_SYS\_KILL for the overriding capability).
That turns out to not be a great choice - while the system call really
only moves physical page allocations around (and you need other
capabilities to do a lot of it), you can check the return value to map
out some the virtual address choices and defeat ASLR of a binary that
still shares your uid.
So change the access checks to the more common 'ptrace\_may\_access()'
model instead.
This tightens the access checks for the uid, and also effectively
changes the CAP\_SYS\_NICE check to CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE, but it's unlikely that
anybody really \_uses\_ this legacy system call any more (we hav ebetter
NUMA placement models these days), so I expect nobody to notice.
Famous last words.
