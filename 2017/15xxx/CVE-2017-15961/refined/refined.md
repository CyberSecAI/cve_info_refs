Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `ID` parameter in the URL.
*   Specifically, the `ID` parameter in requests to `index.php` with `cmd=agent` and `cmd=client_master` are vulnerable.
*   The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, which occurs when user-controlled data is inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious SQL commands.
*   This allows the attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database.
*   It also allows the possibility to gain further access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests.
*   Vulnerable URLs are of the form:
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?cmd=agent&mod=true&ID=[SQL]`
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?cmd=client_master&mod=true&ID=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not appear to need any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit is for iProject Management System 1.0
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ihsan Sencan.
*   The exploit was tested on Windows 7 x64 and Kali Linux x64.
