```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the `new-mppeencryption` parameter in the `pptp_client.lua` file. This allows for command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability. The application doesn't properly sanitize the 'new-mppeencryption' input before using it in a system command.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system by injecting malicious commands through the vulnerable parameter. This could lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the router.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a POST request to the web management panel with a crafted `new-mppeencryption` parameter within the `pptp_client.lua` file's handling logic.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator on the TP-Link router. This can be achieved via LAN access or remotely if remote management is enabled."
