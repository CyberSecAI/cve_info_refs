{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The tomcat-native library, which provides Tomcat with access to the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library's network connection (socket) implementation and random-number generator, fails to properly parse the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate when the fields are longer than 127 bytes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of long fields in AIA-Extension.",
      "OCSP check bypass due to parsing error."
    ],
    "impact": "Client certificates that should have been rejected based on OCSP checks may be accepted, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A specially crafted client certificate with an AIA-Extension field longer than 127 bytes is presented to the server."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to present a client certificate to the server for authentication. They need to be able to craft a certificate with an AIA-Extension field longer than 127 bytes."
