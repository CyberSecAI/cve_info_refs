Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient validation of DNSSEC signatures in the PowerDNS Recursor. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the component that validates DNSSEC signatures, where signatures might be accepted as valid even if the signed data was not in the bailiwick of the DNSKEY used to sign it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Incorrect DNSSEC signature validation. The server does not properly verify if a signature is valid for the zone it's associated with.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Records Manipulation:** An attacker can alter the content of DNS records by creating a valid signature for crafted records. This allows them to inject or modify DNS data.
*   The advisory mentions "Impact: Records manipulation"
*   While the impact is record manipulation, the content notes that there is "no risk of system compromise".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM):** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is positioned as a man-in-the-middle between the client and the authoritative DNS server. This allows them to intercept and modify DNS traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the DNS server to inject crafted DNS responses.

**Affected Versions:**

*   PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.6 are affected.
*   Versions prior to 4.0.0 and 4.0.7 are not affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to PowerDNS Recursor version 4.0.7 or later.
*   A minimal patch is available for those who cannot upgrade immediately.
