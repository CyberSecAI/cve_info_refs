Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that OctoberCMS 1.0.425 (Build 425) allows users to upload SVG files as avatars without proper sanitization. SVG files can contain embedded JavaScript and arbitrary HTML, which can be executed when the SVG is rendered in a browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript embedded within a user's SVG avatar is executed in the context of the admin's session when the admin views the user's profile. This bypasses normal XSS protections which are usually applied to user generated data.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize SVG files upon upload, allowing the inclusion of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Account Compromise:** An attacker, by uploading a malicious SVG avatar, can execute JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This could lead to session hijacking, allowing an attacker to take over an admin's account and perform privileged actions.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can potentially modify system configurations, create new users, or perform other administrative tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Upload of Malicious SVG:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing JavaScript as their user avatar.
*   **Admin Viewing User Profile:** The admin views the vulnerable user's profile, triggering the execution of the malicious script contained within the SVG.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Least Privileged User Account:** The attacker needs a user account with the ability to upload an avatar.
*   **Knowledge of SVG Exploitation:** The attacker must know how to embed malicious JavaScript within an SVG file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit log from GitHub (3bbbbf3da469f457881b5af902eb0b89b95189a2) shows the removal of SVG from the list of allowed image types, which is a mitigation for this issue.
*   The exploit-db entry (42978) provides detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability and highlights the lack of sanitization as the main issue.
*   The discussion in the github commit implies that even if SVG is used within an `<img>` tag, there are ways it can be exploited (via `<image>` which is different) if external resources are not disallowed.
*   The exploit-db description implies that the "Attachment URL" is where the exploit is triggered.
