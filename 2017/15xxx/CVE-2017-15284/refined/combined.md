I'm not sure why this was added in the first place, so can't really comment. If SVG is truly needed, one can override the acceptable types in the form widget itself. This list defines what is considered safe and SVG is not considered safe.

[@daftspunk](https://github.com/daftspunk)

Yes, we can all agree on that. However, the fact of the matter is, even though SVG is a document format, and not an image format, it still makes sense for a MEDIA-Manager to support those SVG's that do represent an image. So, while we can enable uploading SVG's, there are no previews in the media manager grid views.

I wanted to add support for this (just previews), but seeing how they will now be disabled by default, [the PR I made a while back](https://github.com/octobercms/october/pull/3106) will need some changes. It's nothing complicated and will not break anything as far as I can tell.

Still, the question is, is this something you will consider? Cause if not, there is no point in me doing more work on this subject.

I think if you are going to enable uploads of svg, they should be sanitized for sure. Its too risky to be able to allow for arbitrary JS to be executed if a client uploads a random SVG found online or worse if there's a public upload form in the frontend that somehow ends up visible in the cms views.

[@osmanzeki](https://github.com/osmanzeki) It‚Äòs always been possible to upload svg‚Äòs, this is not what this issue is about. My initial commit was simply enabling previews of svg‚Äòs in the media manager.

I see. Am I correct to assume then that if an svg is previewed in the media manager, that its code is executed and could expose the CMS to xss attacks?

In any case, I think previews for svgs are beneficial for sure, but only if we add the sanitization on uploads with it.

[@osmanzeki](https://github.com/osmanzeki) he's just putting the URL of the SVG in the img element. That forces the browser to render it purely as an image which eliminates the issues with XSS. It's not going to be rendered straight to HTML at all.

   - Login using a normal user and click on my account.
   - Click on the avatar.
   - Upload the malicious .svg file which contains the javascript
   - Click on save.
   - Login in another browser with Admin Credentials.
   - Click on Settings > Administrators.
   - Select the normal user's avatar and click on Attachment URL.

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
