{
  "CVE-2017-15268": {
    "description": "A memory leak in websockets support may result in denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The websocket GSource was monitoring the size of the rawoutput buffer, which is a temporary staging buffer, instead of the encoutput buffer. This caused the encoutput buffer to grow without bound if the other end of the underlying data channel doesn't read data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect buffer monitoring in websocket implementation.",
      "Memory leak due to unbounded buffer growth."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious VNC client or a slow WAN connection could cause the encoutput buffer to grow without bound, leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network (VNC connection via websockets)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A remote attacker, either malicious or on a slow network, needs to establish a VNC connection with a QEMU instance via websockets and generate a high rate of framebuffer updates (e.g., playing a video). The attacker needs to read the data slowly to exacerbate the memory leak."
