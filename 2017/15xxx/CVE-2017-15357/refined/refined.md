  "CVE-2017-15357": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The updater binary has a \"setpermissions\" function which sets the suid bit and root ownership on itself but it suffers from a race condition.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race Condition",
        "Local Privilege Escalation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this race condition to gain +s and root ownership on any arbitrary binary.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system",
        "Symlink manipulation"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks and execute programs on the target system as a user."
    },
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability resides in versions of Arq for macOS before 5.9.7 and other binaries in the application also suffer from the same issue. The provided exploit uses a symlink to redirect the setpermissions operation from the legitimate updater binary to a custom crafted one. "
