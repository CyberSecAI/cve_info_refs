{
  "CVE-2017-15121": {
    "Root cause": "A bug exists in the `truncate_inode_pages_range()` function in the Virtual File System (VFS) when dealing with a FUSE client. A non-page aligned range of bytes may be passed to this function which can trigger an issue",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of a non-page aligned range by truncate_inode_pages_range() function"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, non-privileged user can crash a system if an application punches a hole in a file that does not end aligned to a page boundary while mounted through FUSE.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local, non-privileged user can trigger the bug by mounting a fuse filesystem and using a specific application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A non-privileged user with the ability to mount a FUSE filesystem, and an application capable of creating files with non page-aligned holes."
  }
