Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in various Lua files used by TP-Link router firmware. Specifically, user-supplied input, such as interface names, is not properly sanitized before being used in system commands. This allows for command injection.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Attackers can inject arbitrary shell commands into the system by manipulating specific parameters sent to the router's web management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
*   **Full Router Control:** This can lead to complete compromise of the router, allowing attackers to modify settings, intercept traffic, install backdoors, or use the router as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Management Interface:** The vulnerabilities are exposed through the web management interface of the router.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack is performed via crafted HTTP POST requests containing malicious payloads in specific parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to have valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This implies that they must either know the administrator password or have compromised the router through some other means.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the router's web management interface, either from the local network or remotely if the "remote management" feature is enabled.

**Specific Vulnerability Details from the Document:**

*   **CVE-2017-15615:** The vulnerability exists in the `pptp_client.lua` file, specifically through the `lcpechointerval` variable.
*   The document also provides details on how other CVEs in the range CVE-2017-15613 to CVE-2017-15637 are triggered through other variables in different lua files.
*   The vulnerability description of CVE-2017-15616 is used as a general example due to the similar nature of all the vulnerabilities in the mentioned range.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `/usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/admin/phddns.lua` file. The `interface` argument passed in the POST request `ip/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=xxx/admin/phddns?form=phddns` is vulnerable to command injection. The code does not properly validate the input before using it in `sys.fork_exec`.
*   The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) code demonstrates how to exploit CVE-2017-15616 by sending a crafted request that injects the `telnetd` command.
*   The provided PoC code shows the steps required:
    * Login to web interface
    * Construct a malicious payload in the `interface` parameter
    * Send a POST request to the vulnerable URL with the malicious payload.
* The document lists the affected TP-Link models.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of TP-Link SOHO/WiFi routers.
*   The vendor has confirmed that these vulnerabilities have been fixed in later firmware updates.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered both in LAN and WAN if "remote management" is enabled.
