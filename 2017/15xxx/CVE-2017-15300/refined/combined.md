Also ewbf isn't giving me any ip address.  I did do the ipconfig under windows 10, and added a few ip's but not accepting. They want your PUBLIC IP address, not the local one (if you use a NAT router, they won't be the same). Try "myipis" as a google search to find various sites that will tell you your public IP address.myipis worked!  Thanks!or <https://www.whatismyip.com>That didn't work for me.<http://www.myipis.net/>   did work. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
