Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to EWBF's CUDA Zcash miner:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The HTTP API of EWBF's CUDA Zcash miner is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The API hangs on incoming TCP connections until a request is made. This allows an attacker to open a connection without sending a request, effectively blocking the API.
- The API can sometimes be completely stopped from responding to TCP requests even after the attack has ceased, requiring a restart of the miner to regain access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can prevent users from accessing their mining statistics through the HTTP API.
- In some cases, the API can be rendered completely unresponsive, requiring a miner restart.
- The mining operation itself is not affected by this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network connection.
- The attack can be performed using tools like `telnet` or `netcat`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the miner and knowledge of the miner's IP address and HTTP API port.
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the miner's API port.

**Technical Details:**
- The attack involves opening a TCP connection to the miner's HTTP API port without sending any text/request.
- The miner's API will hang and not respond to subsequent requests until the offending connection is closed, or the connection sends a valid request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is reported for EWBF's Cuda Zcash Miner Version 0.3.4b.
- The impact of the vulnerability is limited to the miner's API, and the mining operation itself is unaffected.
