Friday, October 27, 2017

The Stable channel has been updated to 62.0.3202.74 (Platform version: 9901.54.0/1) for most\* Chrome OS devices. This build contains a number of bug fixes and security updates. Systems will be receiving updates over the next several days.

New Features

* Kerberos SSO integration for Active Directory managed Chrome OS devices
* Ability to zoom legacy apps in tablet mode
* Randomized Alternate Hosts for Captive Portal Detection
* Chrome notification style & interactions refresh
* Enhanced touch experience in Files app
* Support for full-screen apps in Enterprise Public Session mode
* ARC++ inbound network connections

Security Fixes

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

[[762671](https://crbug.com/762671)] This update includes fixes for the [KRACK vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRACK) (CVE-2017-13077 to 13082, 13084, 13086 to 13088).

[$100,000][[766253](https://crbug.com/766253)] Critical: Persistent code execution on Chrome OS. Reported by Anonymous on 2017-09-18

* [[766260](https://crbug.com/766260)] High CVE-2017-15401: Out of bounds memory access in V8

[$TBD][[777215](https://crbug.com/777215)] High CVE-2017-15400: CRLF and code injection in printer zeroconfig. Reported by Rory McNamara on 2017-10-22

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

If you find new issues, please let us know by visiting our [forum](https://chromebook.com/community) or [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/). Interested in switching channels? [Find out how.](https://www.google.com/support/chromeos/bin/answer.py?answer=1086915) You can submit feedback using ‘Report an issue...’ in the Chrome menu (3 vertical dots in the upper right corner of the browser).

# ChromeOS Doesn’t Always Use SSL During Startup [CVE-2017-15397]

[January 1, 2018](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/01/01/chromeos-doesnt-always-use-ssl-during-startup-cve-2017-15397/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)

# Summary

**ChromeOS** did not use SSL in all network calls originating from the ChromeVox component during startup. This could potentially have allowed an MITM attacker to inject content into ChromeOS or crash the device. The vendor (Google) fixed this issue in **Chrome M62**. Google has assigned **CVE-2017-15397** to track this issue.

# Details

ChromeOS is the operating system developed by Google that runs on ChromeBook devices. It is build on top of Linux and around the Chrome browser.

By monitoring network traffic using a proxy we noticed that some network calls originating from the ChromeVox component did not use SSL. These calls occured during the startup process before a user logged in. Because these calls did not use SSL, it would be possible for an MITM attacker, in theory, to either inject their own content into ChromeOS, or crash the device by sending a very large packet. We did not conduct any follow-up testing to confirm either of these two possibilities.

To reproduce:

1. Setup a proxy with WiFi.

2. Switch ChromeOS device to use proxy.

3. Restart the device and on the login screen enable ChromeVox.

4. Observe calls to HTTP without SSL.

All testing was done on an Acer ChromeBook, running Chrome version 51.0.2704.106 \*stable) and ChromeOS version 8172.62.0 (stable).

# Vendor Response

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor via the Chromium bug tracker. The vendor fixed this issue in ChromeOS release M62 and assigned CVE-2017-15397 to track it.
