CVE-2017-15093:
  - Root cause: Insufficient validation of new netmask and IP addresses of forwarded zones.
  - Weakness: Configuration file injection in the API. An authenticated user could inject new configuration directives into the Recursor's configuration.
  - Impact: Alteration of configuration by an API user.
  - Attack vector: Attacker with valid API credentials.
  - Required capabilities: Valid API credentials.
  - Affected versions: PowerDNS Recursor up to and including 4.0.6, 3.7.4.
  - Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version (PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.7) or disable the ability to alter the configuration via the API by setting api-config-dir to an empty value (default), or set the API read-only via the api-readonly setting.
