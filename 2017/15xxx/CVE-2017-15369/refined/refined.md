- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `fz_drop_imp()` function due to a variable not being properly managed with `fz_var()`. This likely means that memory associated with the variable is freed prematurely, and then later accessed, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to a heap-use-after-free error.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted PDF file using the `mutool` command-line tool. The specific PDF that triggers the vulnerability is included in the provided attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PDF file to a system running the vulnerable `mupdf` software.
