{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the lua files of TP-Link routers. Specifically, the 'new-bindif' variable in the pptp_server.lua file is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected router with administrative privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access (if 'remote management' is enabled)",
      "Local network access"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
       "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator on the web management interface of the router."
