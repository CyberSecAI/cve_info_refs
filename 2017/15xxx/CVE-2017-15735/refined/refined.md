The provided content is a commit diff from the phpMyFAQ project, specifically addressing the addition of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability being addressed is the lack of CSRF protection in several admin actions related to glossary management (add, edit, delete). Without this protection, an attacker could potentially trick an administrator into performing unwanted actions by submitting malicious requests from a different site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The original code did not include any mechanism to verify that requests originated from the legitimate admin page, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially add, edit, or delete glossary entries without the administrator's explicit consent or knowledge. This could lead to data manipulation, defacement of the FAQ, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft malicious links or forms on a separate website that, when clicked or submitted by a logged-in administrator, would send requests to phpMyFAQ's admin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to know (or be able to guess) the URL structure and parameters of the vulnerable actions.
- The attacker would need to entice a logged-in administrator to interact with the malicious content (e.g., by clicking a link).
- The administrator would need to be logged into phpMyFAQ when interacting with the malicious content for the attack to succeed.

**Changes in the Commit:**

The commit introduces the following changes to mitigate the CSRF vulnerability:

1.  **CSRF Token Generation and Inclusion:**
    *   A CSRF token is generated and stored in the user's session.
    *   This token is included as a hidden input field in the relevant forms (`glossary.add.php`, `glossary.edit.php`).
    *   The token is also added as a GET parameter to the delete action URL within `glossary.main.php`.
2.  **CSRF Token Validation:**
    *   In `glossary.main.php`, the `saveglossary`, `updateglossary` and `deleteglossary` actions check if the received CSRF token matches the one stored in the session.
    *   If the tokens don't match, the corresponding actions are prevented from executing.

**Additional Details:**
- The code uses the `$user->getCsrfTokenFromSession()` method to retrieve the CSRF token from the session.
- The changes involve checking the POST CSRF token for `saveglossary` and `updateglossary` actions and the GET CSRF token for the `deleteglossary` action.
- It utilizes  `PMF_Filter::filterInput` to sanitize input data, which may be a separate vulnerability mitigation (not related to CSRF directly), but included in the context of these changes.

In summary, this commit implements CSRF protection by adding hidden tokens to forms and validating these tokens on the server side, thus preventing unauthorized actions from external sources.
