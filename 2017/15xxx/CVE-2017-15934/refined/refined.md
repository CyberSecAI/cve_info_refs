The content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Pandora FMS Enterprise, including CVE-2017-15934.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability (CVE-2017-15934):**
The root cause is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the file manager functionality, which allows administrators to upload files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present (CVE-2017-15934):**
-  The vulnerability is present in the way the application includes remote files, specifically through the file manager functionality.
-  The application allows administrators to upload arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation (CVE-2017-15934):**

- In this specific attack, the attacker obtains a reverse shell on the server, gaining full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors (CVE-2017-15934):**
- The attacker must be logged in as an administrator to use the file manager function.
- The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file to the server, which can then be executed via RFI.
- A remote connection is then established to the attacker's IP, resulting in a reverse shell.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position (CVE-2017-15934):**
- The attacker needs administrator-level access to the Pandora FMS Enterprise application.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files using the file manager feature.
- The attacker must have a server to receive the reverse shell connection.
