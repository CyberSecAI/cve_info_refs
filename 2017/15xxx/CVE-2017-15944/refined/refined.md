Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-15944:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a chain of three bugs that can be exploited together to achieve remote code execution as root.

1.  **Authentication Bypass:**  The `readSessionVarsFromFile()` function, used for parsing session data, has a flaw. It uses `strtok()` which doesn't correctly parse PHP session data, allowing an attacker to inject values into the session file. This is achieved by calling `/esp/cms_changeDeviceContext.esp` without authentication, and injecting a crafted string in the `device` parameter that includes the `";` sequence. This allows for the manipulation of the `user` variable within the session data. This bypasses the authentication check implemented by `panAuthCheck` directive.
2.  **Arbitrary Directory Creation:** The `/php/utils/router.php` allows API requests to be made to the backend. The `Administrator.get` method has an XML injection vulnerability via the `jsonArgs->id` parameter. By injecting a directory traversal string into the cookie attribute of the `request` tag in XML request along with `async-mode='yes'`, an attacker can create an arbitrary directory with an attacker controlled path in the filesystem.
3.  **Command Injection:** A cron job runs the script `/usr/local/bin/genindex_batch.sh`, which in turn executes `/usr/local/bin/genindex.sh`. The `genindex.sh` script has a command injection vulnerability where the output of a `find` command is used as arguments in another `find` command without proper quoting, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the directory name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Session Parsing:** `readSessionVarsFromFile()` uses `strtok()` improperly, leading to session data injection.
*   **XML Injection:** Unsanitized input in `Administrator.get` method allows XML injection.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Ability to control the path where a directory is created through the injected XML.
*   **Command Injection:** Improper handling of filenames in `genindex.sh` leads to command injection.
*   **Authentication Bypass**: The `panCheckSessionExpired()` function doesn't handle unexpected states in the session file and incorrectly flags authentication as successful.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the affected system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker gains complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerabilities are exploited remotely through the device's management interface (typically web interface).
*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploitation involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the target's management interface (typically exposed on port 443).
*   **No Authentication Required Initially**: The initial authentication bypass does not require any valid credentials or prior knowledge of the system.
*   **Exploit Chaining:** Requires knowledge of all 3 vulnerabilities to be chained together.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit leverages a reverse TLS callback to stage a payload on the target.
*   The cron job used for the final payload runs every 15 minutes, making exploitation time dependent on cron job execution.
*   Vulnerable PAN-OS versions include 6.1.18 and earlier, 7.0.18 and earlier, 7.1.13 and earlier and 8.0.5 and earlier.
*   Patched versions include 6.1.19, 7.0.19, 7.1.14, and 8.0.6.
