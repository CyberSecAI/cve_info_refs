Is there a CVE for this?

Do we need a formal embargo for this? (IMHO not, I'd classify it as annoying, but non-critical remote DoS) I. e. when can the fix be pushed upstream?

Thanks!

Do you think this vulnerability deserve a CVE as the bug isn't really critical ? How do we request a CVE ID ?

We also don't require an embargo on the release of the fix.

Thank you,

A CVE is not about "critical", it's just a succinct name/label to put into changelogs, patches, etc. to say what you are talking about. But of course "LP: [#1725351](/bugs/1725351)" just works as well as a reference. :-) (but it's distro specific)

@Marc: Everyone agreed to not have an embargo, and the downstream PR is public. It doesn't have much detail, but IMHO this can become public now.

We manually enable systemd-resolved.service on xenial. It's installed though it is not the default. Does that mean we are not going to get the fix for this?

I'm also not an expert on NSEC/DNSSEC. Is this something that any random app that uses DNS can be vulnerable too, or does it require a program to specifically be trying to invoke DNSSEC somehow?

Thanks Marc! Do you happen to know the answer to my other question?

"I'm also not an expert on NSEC/DNSSEC. Is this something that any random app that uses DNS can be vulnerable too, or does it require a program to specifically be trying to invoke DNSSEC somehow?"

Is there a CVE for this?

Do we need a formal embargo for this? (IMHO not, I'd classify it as annoying, but non-critical remote DoS) I. e. when can the fix be pushed upstream?

Thanks!

Do you think this vulnerability deserve a CVE as the bug isn't really critical ? How do we request a CVE ID ?

We also don't require an embargo on the release of the fix.

Thank you,

A CVE is not about "critical", it's just a succinct name/label to put into changelogs, patches, etc. to say what you are talking about. But of course "LP: [#1725351](/bugs/1725351)" just works as well as a reference. :-) (but it's distro specific)

@Marc: Everyone agreed to not have an embargo, and the downstream PR is public. It doesn't have much detail, but IMHO this can become public now.

We manually enable systemd-resolved.service on xenial. It's installed though it is not the default. Does that mean we are not going to get the fix for this?

I'm also not an expert on NSEC/DNSSEC. Is this something that any random app that uses DNS can be vulnerable too, or does it require a program to specifically be trying to invoke DNSSEC somehow?

# USN-3558-1: systemd vulnerabilities

5 February 2018

Several security issues were fixed in systemd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [systemd](/security/cves?package=systemd) - system and service manager

## Details

Karim Hossen & Thomas Imbert and Nelson William Gamazo Sanchez

independently discovered that systemd-resolved incorrectly handled certain

DNS responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

systemd to temporarily stop responding, resulting in a denial of service.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-15908](/security/CVE-2017-15908))

It was discovered that systemd incorrectly handled automounted volumes. A

local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause applications to hang,

resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-1049](/security/CVE-2018-1049))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [systemd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd)
  -
  [229-4ubuntu21.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd/229-4ubuntu21.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [systemd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd)
  -
  [204-5ubuntu20.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd/204-5ubuntu20.26)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## Description

In systemd 223 through 235, a remote DNS server can respond with a custom crafted DNS NSEC resource record to trigger an infinite loop in the dns\_packet\_read\_type\_window() function of the 'systemd-resolved' service and cause a DoS of the affected service.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Binary packages built by this source

[gir1.2-gudev-1.0](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/gir1.2-gudev-1.0):
libgudev-1.0 introspection data

This package contains the GObject-introspection data of libgudev-1.0 in

 binary typelib format.

[libgudev-1.0-0](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/libgudev-1.0-0):
GObject-based wrapper library for libudev

This library makes it much simpler to use libudev from programs already using

 GObject. It also makes it possible to easily use libudev from other

 programming languages, such as Javascript, because of GObject introspection

 support.

[libgudev-1.0-0-dbgsym](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/libgudev-1.0-0-dbgsym):
debug symbols for package libgudev-1.0-0

This library makes it much simpler to use libudev from programs already using

 GObject. It also makes it possible to easily use libudev from other

 programming languages, such as Javascript, because of GObject introspection

 support.

[libgudev-1.0-dev](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/libgudev-1.0-dev):
libgudev-1.0 development files

This package contains the files needed for developing applications that

 use libgudev-1.0.

[libpam-systemd](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/libpam-systemd):
