{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Sera application stores the user's login password in a plaintext file within the user's home directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Plaintext storage of sensitive credentials. This allows for local privilege escalation and disclosure of the user's password.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root/administrator, ability to dump the user's keychain (and potentially system keychain for admin users) because the user's login password can be obtained.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the user's file system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have local access to the target system and be able to read the user's home directory files."
