Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-15978

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the AROX School ERP PHP Script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection (SQLi). Specifically, the application is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection, where the attacker can inject SQL commands through the `id` parameter, making the server sleep for a specified duration. This allows the attacker to deduce information about the database structure and content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    -   Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information from the database.
    -   Data modification: Altering or deleting data within the database.
    -   Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.
    -  Complete compromise of the system: depending on the database user permissions
- The vulnerability can be exploited to perform time-based blind SQL injection, confirming the vulnerability through time delays.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request using the vulnerable `id` parameter in the following URLs:
- `http://localhost/[PATH]/office_admin/?pid=95&action=print_charactercertificate&id=[SQL]`
- `http://localhost/[PATH]/office_admin/?pid=95&action=edit&id=3[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
- No prior authentication is explicitly mentioned in the exploit, suggesting the vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
