- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'username' field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. They could also gain unauthorized access to the application and its database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the login form of the application, specifically by manipulating the 'username' parameter within an HTTP POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application, with the ability to modify the `username` field. No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
