Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2017-15808:

**Verification:**

The commit message "Added missing CSRF token" and the code diffs strongly suggest this commit addresses a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, which aligns with the common nature of CVE-2017-15808. The changes specifically add CSRF token validation to the `ajax.config.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protection in the `add_instance` AJAX action, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability in the `add_instance` AJAX action within the phpMyFAQ admin panel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially trick an authenticated administrator into performing unintended actions, such as adding malicious instances. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, such as:
    - Injection of malicious content
    - Redirection to malicious URLs
    - Unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious web page or email with a forged request to the vulnerable `add_instance` endpoint. If the victim is an authenticated user of phpMyFAQ and clicks on the crafted link or loads the malicious page in the browser, the forged request will be sent to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated phpMyFAQ administrator to interact with their malicious content (e.g., by clicking a link or loading a malicious page).

**Technical details:**

The commit introduces the following changes to mitigate the vulnerability:

1.  **`phpmyfaq/admin/ajax.config.php`:**
    *   A CSRF token check is added to the `add_instance` case:
        ```php
        if (!isset($_SESSION['phpmyfaq_csrf_token']) || $_SESSION['phpmyfaq_csrf_token'] !== $csrfToken) {
            $http->sendJsonWithHeaders(array('error' => $PMF_LANG['err_NotAuth']));
            exit(1);
        }
        ```
        This ensures that requests to this endpoint must include a valid CSRF token.
2.  **`phpmyfaq/admin/instances.php`:**
    *   The CSRF token is added to the AJAX call when adding an instance:
        ```javascript
           $.get('index.php',
               { action: 'ajax', ajax: 'config', ajaxaction: 'add_instance', csrf: csrf, url: url,
               instance: instance, comment: comment, email: email, admin: admin, password: password
               },
        ```

These changes ensure that the `add_instance` action is only executed if a valid CSRF token is present, preventing CSRF attacks.

In summary, this commit effectively addresses the CSRF vulnerability by implementing CSRF token validation.
