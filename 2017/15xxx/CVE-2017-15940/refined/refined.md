Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-15940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the PAN-OS web interface's packet capture management.
*   Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, specifically related to how the web interface handles user inputs when managing packet captures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The core issue is a command injection vulnerability. An authenticated user can inject arbitrary commands into the system through the packet capture management feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the PAN-OS system. This could lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality Impact (High):** Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Integrity Impact (High):** Modification of system configurations or data.
    *   **Availability Impact (High):** Disruption of services and system functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network through the PAN-OS web interface.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability exists in the web interface packet capture management feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** An attacker must have valid credentials to access the PAN-OS web interface.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-15940 is a critical command injection vulnerability in the PAN-OS web interface. An authenticated attacker could leverage the packet capture management feature to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system, leading to full compromise. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the network.

The provided text includes more detail than the original CVE description by specifying that the issue exists within packet capture management in the web interface, thus providing additional context for the vulnerability.
