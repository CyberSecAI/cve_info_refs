Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper access controls in Zivif cameras, allowing direct calls to CGI functions without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass authentication checks and directly access CGI functions.
- **Cleartext Credentials:** The vulnerability allows retrieval of user credentials in cleartext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of User Credentials:** Attackers can obtain usernames and passwords (including admin credentials) in cleartext. This can lead to complete device compromise.
- Potential for further attacks by using the obtained credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network using HTTP.
- **Direct CGI Call:**  The attack vector involves crafting a specific HTTP request to a CGI endpoint, namely `/web/cgi-bin/hi3510/param.cgi?cmd=getuser`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable camera's IP address.
- No authentication or prior knowledge of credentials is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Zivif PR115-204-P-RS camera version V2.3.4.2103.
- The device returns the usernames, passwords, and auth levels of all users.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to user credentials by sending an unauthenticated HTTP request to the camera.
