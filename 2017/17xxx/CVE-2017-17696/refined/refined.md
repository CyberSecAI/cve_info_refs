The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Techno Portfolio Management Panel, but **does not directly relate to CVE-2017-17696.** The described vulnerabilities are:

*   **Information Leak:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application reveals the absolute path of the `search.php` file in the server's file system.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's directory structure, which can assist in further attacks.
    *   **Attack vector:** By sending a request to the `search.php` endpoint with a specific parameter (`s=1`).
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:**  An attacker needs to send HTTP requests and analyze responses.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *  **Root cause:** The `search.php` page is vulnerable to XSS via the `s` parameter.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization/output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. This could result in session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious payload in the `s` parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request, and the victim needs to visit the vulnerable URL.

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Root cause:** The `search.php` page is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `s` parameter.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper parameterization when building SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially compromising the entire application.
    *   **Attack vector:** By sending SQL injection payloads in the `s` parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to craft SQL injection payloads and send them as a query parameter.

*   **Broken Access Control:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application does not properly validate user permissions when deleting feedback.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** A normal user can gain administrative privileges and delete feedback entries that should only be accessible to an administrator.
    *   **Attack vector:** By replacing the user's session cookie with the administrator's cookie.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to access the application with two different user accounts (normal and admin), capture their cookies, and replace the cookie during a request to delete feedback entries.

**Summary:** The content describes information leak, XSS, SQL injection, and broken access control vulnerabilities in the Techno Portfolio Management Panel. However, since no reference is made to the specified CVE, this response is:
