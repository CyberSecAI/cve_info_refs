Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17629:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the Secure E-commerce Script version 2.0.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied inputs in the `searchmain` and `searchcat` GET parameters, which allows for SQL injection. Additionally, `sid` parameter in `single_detail.php` is also vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
   - Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive data like user credentials, product information, etc.).
   - Data modification (altering or deleting data).
   - Potential complete compromise of the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges
   - Information disclosure (extracting version, database names)
  
**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests. The vulnerable parameters are `searchmain` and `searchcat` in `category.php` and `sid` in `single_detail.php` .

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious queries. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

The exploit example provided demonstrates how to inject SQL queries using `UNION` statements to retrieve version information. It also shows a boolean-based blind SQL injection payload.
