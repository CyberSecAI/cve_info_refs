Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Dolphin Browser for Android's Backup and Restore feature does not properly validate the contents of backup files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The backup restore process allows overwriting of arbitrary files within the Dolphin Browser's data directory.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the contents of a backup file, allowing a crafted malicious backup to overwrite files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting a specific executable within the Dolphin Browser's data directory with a malicious executable, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the browser is launched.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious backup file is crafted by the attacker.
- The crafted backup file is then used to restore the Dolphin Browser's settings via the built-in restore functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create a crafted Dolphin Browser backup file.
- The attacker must then be able to have the victim restore this crafted backup file through the Dolphin Browser's built-in restore functionality.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of Dolphin Browser for Android prior to 12.0.2.
- The vendor, Mobotap, did not respond to multiple attempts to report the vulnerability, and has not released a patch.
