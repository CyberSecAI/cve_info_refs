Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is SQL injection vulnerabilities in the FS Expedia Clone 1.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through multiple parameters. Specifically, the `fl_orig`, `fl_dest` and `id` parameters in `show-flight-result.php`, `pages.php`, and `content.php` are susceptible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database queries.
*   This could lead to a variety of impacts, including:
    *   **Data breaches:** The attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data manipulation:** The attacker may be able to modify or delete data.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** Depending on the database user permissions, the attacker might be able to gain administrative access to the database or underlying system.
    *   **Information Disclosure**: The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract database information such as `USER(), DATABASE(), VERSION()` along with schema information via `information_schema`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable pages.
*   Specifically, the following vulnerable pages and parameters were identified:
    *   `show-flight-result.php?fl_orig=[SQL]`
    *   `show-flight-result.php?fl_dest=[SQL]`
    *  `pages.php?id=[SQL]`
   * `content.php?id=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned as required for exploitation, indicating a remote attack vulnerability.
