Product description:
-------------------
“The bi-directional radio system BiSecur is based on future-oriented
technology for the convenient and secure operation of garage and entrance
gate operators, door operators, lights and more. This extremely secure
BiSecur encryption protocol, developed by Hoermann, with a stable,
interference-free range makes sure that no-one can copy your radio signal.”

Vulnerability description:
--------------------------
The Hoermann BiSecur radio system uses a proprietary encryption scheme, with
the AES-128 algorithm at its core, to secure the radio communication between
transmitter and receiver. During an initial key generation process or a
device reset, the transmitter utilizes a key generation algorithm based
on the proprietary Hoermann encryption scheme to generate a new encryption key.
The key is used to protect any subsequent radio communication between
transmitter and receiver.

The key generation algorithm uses a static initial 80-bit random value,
a static 128-bit data vector (both are common to all observed
Hoermann BiSecur transmitters) and the individual 32-bit serial
number (transmitted in the clear during all transmissions).

The vulnerability can be exploited by recording a single radio transmission.
An attacker can thus intercept an arbitrary radio frame exchanged between a
BiSecur transmitter and a receiver to obtain the encrypted packet and the
32-bit serial number. The interception of the one-time pairing process is
specifically not required. Due to the initial static random value and the
static data vector (common to Hoermann BiSecur transmitters), the attacker
can easily derive the utilized encryption key and decrypt the intercepted packet.
The key can be verified by decrypting the intercepted packet and checking
for known plaintext.

Subsequently, an attacker can create arbitrary radio frames with the
correct encryption key to control BiSecur garage and entrance gate
operators and possibly other BiSecur systems as well.
To conduct the attack, a low cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) is sufficient.

Vulnerability impact:
--------------------------
-
-
-
      (untested)
-

Over the air cloning of transmitters (“copying of radio signal”)
Unauthorized control and access to garage and entrance gates
Likely impact on other BiSecure devices including SmartHome devices

Denial of Service: By advancing the rolling counter value to a value outside
the accepted window (between the genuine transmitter and the receiver), the
genuine transmitter can no longer control the receiver as its transmitted
counter value will be lower than the counter values that are accepted
by the receiver.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
Due to the high number of affected BiSecur systems and users, we do not provide a
proof-of-concept exploit.

Vulnerable / tested devices:
-----------------------------
The following devices have been tested and are known to be vulnerable:

Hoermann Hand Transmitter HS5-868-BS
Hoermann Hand Transmitter HSE1-868-BS
Hoermann Hand Transmitter HSE2-868-BS

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2017-10-04: Involving the Austrian national CERT team as coordinator, we reported
            the security vulnerability including a detailed advisory and a
            suggested security fix so that the manufacturer can fix the issue.

2017-10-31: Confirmation from CERT that the manufacturer received and understood
            the security problem.

2017-11:    Various e-mails and phone calls with manufacturer.

2017-11-30: Meeting with manufacturer - we presented the vulnerability and the

     suggested security fix.

2017-12:    Confirmation from manufacturer - security fix has been implemented and
            is in testing phase.

2017-12-28: Public presentation of the vulnerability at the 34C3 conference.

Solution:
---------
According to the manufacturer, a security fix has been implemented.
Customers should thus contact the manufacturer.

Workaround:
-----------
Not available.
