- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hoermann BiSecur radio system uses a proprietary encryption scheme based on AES-128. The key generation algorithm relies on a static 80-bit random value and a static 128-bit data vector, both of which are common to all vulnerable Hoermann BiSecur transmitters. Combined with the 32-bit serial number transmitted in the clear, this allows an attacker to derive the encryption key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Predictable AES-128 key generation due to static initial values and a static data vector.
    - Transmission of the serial number in clear text.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Over-the-air cloning of transmitters.
    - Unauthorized control and access to garage and entrance gates.
    - Potential impact on other BiSecur devices, including SmartHome devices.
    - Denial of service by manipulating the rolling counter.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Interception of a single radio transmission between a transmitter and receiver to obtain the encrypted packet and the serial number.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to intercept radio transmissions using a Software Defined Radio (SDR).
    - No specific knowledge of the one-time pairing process is required.
