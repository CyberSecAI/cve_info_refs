{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-17051",
  "base_score": "N/A",
  "cvss": "N/A",
  "impact": "An authenticated user can cause a denial of service by repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, leading to the hypervisor host running out of resources.",
  "attack_vector": "An authenticated user can repeatedly rebuild an instance with a new image.",
  "required_capabilities": "Authenticated user with the ability to rebuild an instance with a new image.",
  "vulnerability_details": "The FilterScheduler in OpenStack Nova's scheduler service does not properly track resources when an instance is rebuilt with a new image. The scheduler allocates new resources in Placement for the rebuild, but the ResourceTracker in the compute service does not adjust the allocations. This leads to a double allocation of resources with each rebuild.  Over multiple rebuilds of the same instance with a new image, the Placement service will report the compute node as not having any capacity left and will take it out of scheduling consideration. Eventually the rebuild would fail once the compute node is at capacity.",
   "affected_versions": "OpenStack Nova stable/pike or later deployments with the fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239) applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler. Specifically, Nova version 16.0.3 is vulnerable."
