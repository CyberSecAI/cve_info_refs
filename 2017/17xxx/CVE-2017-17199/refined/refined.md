- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper processing of malformed H323 messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to out-of-bounds read operations and potentially cause a service to become unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker who controls a server connected to the target device can send malformed H323 reply messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control a server that is connected to the vulnerable Huawei device. The attacker sends malformed H323 reply messages to trigger the vulnerability.
