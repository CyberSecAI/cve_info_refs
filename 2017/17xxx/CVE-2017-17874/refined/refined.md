- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of file names before saving them to the server. The application uses `basename($_FILES['thumbnail_file']['name'])`, `basename($_FILES['preview_file']['name'])`, and `basename($_FILES['main_file']['name'])` to extract file names. This allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary extensions by manipulating the file name.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient file name sanitization.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload malicious files, including PHP files, and execute them on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and complete system compromise.

- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can upload a malicious file through the product add/preview functionality by manipulating the filename of the uploaded files.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add new products or product previews.
