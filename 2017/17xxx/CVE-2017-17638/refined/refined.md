  - `http://localhost/[PATH]/city_ajax.php?state_id=[SQL]`
  - `http://localhost/[PATH]/category_list.php?search=[SQL]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
