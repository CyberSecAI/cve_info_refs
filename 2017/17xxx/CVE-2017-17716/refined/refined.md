- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ruby-net-ldap` gem, used by the `omniauth-ldap` library for LDAP authentication in GitLab, does not enable SSL verification by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of SSL certificate verification in the LDAP client.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by impersonating the LDAP server. This would allow the attacker to intercept and potentially modify communication between GitLab and the LDAP server, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based MITM attack, intercepting traffic between GitLab and the LDAP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between GitLab and the LDAP server, such as being on the same network or controlling a network device in the path.
