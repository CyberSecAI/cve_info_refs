Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17976

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a misconfigured elfinder plugin within Perfex CRM 1.9.7, which allows unrestricted file uploads. Specifically, the plugin does not properly validate file extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of restrictions on file uploads. The application fails to properly validate the file extension, allowing an attacker to upload files with potentially dangerous extensions like `.php5`.
-   **MIME Type Bypass:**  The exploit demonstrates a bypass of file content restrictions. By including the text 'demo\n' at the beginning of the file content the uploader is tricked into thinking the content is plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete system takeover.
-   **System Compromise:** By executing malicious code, the attacker gains control over the application and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the Perfex CRM application via the elfinder plugin.
-   **HTTP Requests:** The attack uses specifically crafted HTTP GET and POST requests to create and upload the malicious file to a specific folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Perfex CRM application.
-   **Authentication:** Although not explicitly stated in the exploit, the attacker likely needs to have administrative access or a valid session on the vulnerable Perfex CRM instance to reach the vulnerable `elfinder_init` endpoint.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint**: The attacker needs to know the location of the `elfinder_init` endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker first creates a file named `shell.php5` with an HTTP GET request to `admin/utilities/elfinder_init?cmd=mkfile&name=shell.php5&target=[dir]`. This request circumvents the extension filtering due to the misconfiguration of the file uploader.
- After creating the file, the attacker uploads the malicious PHP code using an HTTP POST request to `/admin/utilities/elfinder_init`. The `cmd` parameter is set to `put`, and the `content` parameter is used to include the PHP code. By adding "demo\n" the content-type check is bypassed, allowing a php5 file to be created and the contained php to be executed.
