Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17651

**Vulnerable Software:** Paid To Read Script 2.0.5

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `uid`, `fnum`, and `fn` parameters used in specific PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input. Specifically, the following parameters are vulnerable:
    *   `uid` parameter in `admin/userview.php`
    *   `fnum` parameter in `admin/viewemcamp.php`
    *   `fn` parameter in `admin/viewvisitcamp.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, financial data, etc.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain full control of the database server and, consequently, the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are through HTTP GET requests to the following vulnerable PHP scripts:
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/admin/userview.php?uid=[SQL]`
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/admin/viewemcamp.php?fnum=[SQL]`
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/admin/viewvisitcamp.php?fn=[SQL]`
The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them into the `uid`, `fnum`, or `fn` parameters of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques. No specific user privileges or access to the server are needed. The attacker can be external to the network hosting the vulnerable server.
