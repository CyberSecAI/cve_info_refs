Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-17805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Salsa20 encryption algorithm in the Linux kernel prior to version 4.14.8 has a flaw where it doesn't properly handle zero-length inputs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness lies in the insufficient input validation within the Salsa20 algorithm's implementation in the kernel. When a zero-length input is provided to the algorithm using the `blkcipher_walk` API it leads to uninitialized memory being freed. The unkeyed state of the underlying hash function used by HMAC is also a weakness. Specifically, the provided content states: "Both the generic implementation (crypto/salsa20_generic.c) and x86 implementation (arch/x86/crypto/salsa20_glue.c) of Salsa20 were vulnerable," which indicates the issue was present in multiple implementations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker can trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition leading to a kernel crash. The provided content mentions, "uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash" as a result of exploitation. There's also mention of "unspecified other impact," although details are not provided. In the context of Red Hat, the impact is rated as "Important".

**Attack vectors:**
A local attacker must be able to utilize the AF_ALG-based skcipher interface (`CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_SKCIPHER`) or the AF\_ALG-based hash interface (`CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_HASH`). The `blkcipher_walk` API must be used when a zero-length input is provided to the vulnerable Salsa20 implementations, or a crafted sequence of system calls that encounter a missing SHA-3 initialization are used to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires local user access and the ability to make specific system calls using the affected cryptographic interfaces and the ability to use crafted sequences of system calls. The attacker must be able to use the AF\_ALG-based skcipher interface with `CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_SKCIPHER` or the AF\_ALG-based hash interface with `CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_HASH`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue affects both generic and x86 implementations of Salsa20.
*   The issue was resolved by properly handling zero-length inputs in the salsa20 algorithm, and validating underlying hash algorithms for HMAC to require an unkeyed hash algorithm.
