Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The application suffers from SQL injection vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `search_result.php` script. Specifically, the parameters `marital`, `gender`, `country`, and `profileid` are vulnerable to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters. This is a classic SQL Injection vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain control over the server.
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive data.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `search_result.php` page with maliciously crafted SQL code injected within the `marital`, `gender`, `country`, and `profileid` parameters.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No special privileges are needed.
    *   The attacker can be a remote user.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit examples provided in the content use `UNION` based SQL injection to retrieve database information.
*   The exploit specifically targets the `information_schema.columns` table to extract table and column names.
*   The provided SQL injection payloads are fairly complex, indicating that the application might have some restrictions in place.
