Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `newid` parameter of the `news-detail.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `newid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to:
    *   Extract sensitive information.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the server if the database user has sufficient privileges.
    *   Execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server through database functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `news-detail.php` file, injecting malicious SQL code into the `newid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Web Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP GET requests and inject SQL code.
*  **No Authentication Required**: The provided exploit code does not suggest any authentication bypass requirements.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit code provided in the document demonstrates how to inject SQL code into the `newid` parameter to retrieve database information.
*   The vulnerable software is identified as MLM Forced Matrix version 2.0.9.
*   The exploit was tested on Windows 7 x64 and Kali Linux x64
*  The PoC SQL injection is time based and extracts `table_name` and `column_name`.
