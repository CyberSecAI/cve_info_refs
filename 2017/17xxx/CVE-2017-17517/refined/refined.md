{
  "CVE-2017-17517": {
    "Description": "libsylph/utils.c in Sylpheed through 3.6 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize or validate the BROWSER environment variable string before launching it, leading to argument injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Argument injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary arguments into the command launched by the application, leading to potential command execution and other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted URLs that exploit the lack of input validation on the BROWSER environment variable.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the BROWSER environment variable, often through a crafted URL."
  }
