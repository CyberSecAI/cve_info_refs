- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Information leak vulnerability in the date service proxy implementation of some Huawei smart phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability exists in the date service proxy implementation, allowing for unauthorized access to kernel date.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leak sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability and gaining access to kernel date.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must trick a user into installing a malicious application. The malicious application then exploits the vulnerable date service proxy implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious application and convince a user to install it. The attacker needs to have local access to the device and user interaction is required for installation.
