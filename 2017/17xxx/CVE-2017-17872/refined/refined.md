- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! Component JEXTN Video Gallery 3.0.5 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `com_jevideogallery` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to database data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially complete server compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `id` parameter in the URL. Specifically, the `index.php?option=com_jevideogallery&view=category&id=[SQL injection]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
