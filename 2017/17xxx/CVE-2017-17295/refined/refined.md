Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-17295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of certain values within SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) packages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The advisory explicitly mentions two buffer overflow vulnerabilities related to SIP packages, with CVE-2017-17295 being one of them. This implies that the insufficient validation allows an attacker to send oversized data in the SIP packets, exceeding the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to "services abnormal." This suggests that the affected services might crash, become unresponsive, or behave unexpectedly. The advisory does not provide further specifics on the impact other than service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Network-based Attack:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted SIP packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected Huawei products.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates that the vulnerability was identified by an internal Huawei tester.
*   The provided document is a security advisory, which includes information about two other vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-17296 and CVE-2017-17297), related to H323 packages and SIP packages, respectively. However, the analysis here focuses specifically on CVE-2017-17295.
*   A large number of Huawei products are affected.

**In summary, CVE-2017-17295 is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability present in several Huawei products due to insufficient validation of SIP packet values. This can lead to service disruption.**
