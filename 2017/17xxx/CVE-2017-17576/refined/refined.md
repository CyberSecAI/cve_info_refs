Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17576

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is SQL injection vulnerability in the FS Gigs Script 1.0. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities in `browse-category.php`, `browse-scategory.php`, and `service-provider.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can manipulate the database by injecting SQL queries.
- This includes the ability to extract sensitive data (e.g. database users, database names, version), and potentially modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the following files with the vulnerable parameters:
   - `browse-category.php?cat=[SQL]`
   - `browse-scategory.php?sc=[SQL]`
   - `service-provider.php?ser=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are needed. The attacker just needs to know the vulnerable parameters and be able to craft the SQL injection strings.
