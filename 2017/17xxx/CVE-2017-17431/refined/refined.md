{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The GeniXCMS application uses the `cleanX()` function to sanitize input parameters, but this function is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate input sanitization using the `cleanX()` function."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to actions like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating HTTP request parameters to include malicious JavaScript code. Several parameters were found to be vulnerable, including the `$mod` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GeniXCMS application with crafted parameters containing XSS payloads."
