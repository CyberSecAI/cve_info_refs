Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `advance_result.php` file of the Opensource Classified Ads Script version 3.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `keyword` parameter in the `advance_result.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., database name, table data).
    - Potentially modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the underlying server if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `advance_result.php` file.
- **`keyword` parameter:** The SQL injection payload is inserted into the `keyword` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **No authentication needed:**  The exploit appears to work without authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject SQL code to extract the database name.
- The PoC uses a specific SQL injection payload to exploit the vulnerability.
- The exploit targets version 3.2 of the "Opensource Classified Ads Script"
