The provided content relates to CVE-2017-17878.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Steam Link device uses the DES algorithm for password hashing within BusyBox, which truncates passwords to the first 8 characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Password truncation: Due to the use of DES, passwords are limited to the first 8 characters, effectively reducing the password's entropy and making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Default password: The device has a default password which is "steamlink" which was mistakenly typed as "steamlin" in the software
- Insecure algorithm: The usage of DES for password hashing is considered insecure due to its limited key size and susceptibility to attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain unauthorized root access to the Steam Link device by exploiting the truncated password.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker would need network access to the Steam Link device, typically through SSH.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to reach the Steam Link device over the network (either local or via IPv6).
- Password knowledge: The attacker needs to know the truncated default password of "steamlin" or any truncated version of a password set by the user.

**Additional details:**
- The blog post details how the issue was discovered, including the fact that Valve initially misidentified the default password.
- It also mentions that a temporary fix is to force the root account to use SHA512 instead of DES for hashing passwords.
- The blog mentions that the device is reachable via IPv6 by default.
