Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the Yoga Class Script 1.0 application. Specifically, the `list?city` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed to the `city` parameter in the `list` endpoint, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the application's database. This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Obtaining sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal data, etc.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    - Potential for further compromise of the server and underlying infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable `list` endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `city` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web application. No special privileges are required beyond that, meaning that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable with no prior authentication required.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection and how to craft SQL payloads for this specific application.

**Additional details from the provided exploit:**
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the usage of a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract database information such as `USER()`, `DATABASE()`, and `VERSION()`. This shows the potential of this SQL injection for sensitive data disclosure.
- The exploit uses comment injection (`--+-`) to terminate the existing SQL query and prevent any errors when executing the injected SQL.
- The application is identified as Yoga Class Script 1.0. The vendor homepage and software download link are also provided.
