  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the 'keyword' parameter of the job search functionality.",
        "SQL injection vulnerability in the `location_name[]` parameter of the job search functionality.",
         "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists that allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, information disclosure, or defacement. An attacker can also gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database (SQLi). A successful CSRF attack can allow an attacker to perform actions that the user did not intend.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "The XSS attack vector involves crafting a malicious payload within the 'keyword' parameter and tricking the user into accessing the crafted URL.",
        "The SQLi attack vector involves manipulating the `location_name[]` parameter to inject malicious SQL queries.",
        "The CSRF attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into submitting a crafted form via a malicious website."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP requests and to trick the user to visit the crafted URL or submit a malicious form, using XSS/CSRF.",
      "additional_information": "The report provides example URLs and payloads for both XSS and SQL injection, including a simple HTML form to demonstrate the CSRF attack. The vulnerable application is identified as 'Ready Made Job Site Script'."
