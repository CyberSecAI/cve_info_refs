Subject: Xen Security Advisory 248 - x86 PV guests may gain access to
 internally used pages

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

                    Xen Security Advisory XSA-248
                              version 2

         x86 PV guests may gain access to internally used pages

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

Provide metadata file.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Memory management for PV guests builds on page ownership and page
attributes.  A domain can always map, at least r/o, pages of which it
is the owner.  Certain fields in the control structure of a page are
used for different purposes in the main PV memory management code and
in code handling shadow paging.

When a guest is running in shadow mode (which for PV guests is necessary
e.g. for live migration), certain auxiliary pages used by Xen internally
had their owner set to the guest itself.  When the PV guest maps such a
page, shadow code and PV memory management code will disagree on the
meaning of said multi-purpose fields, generally leading to a crash of
the hypervisor.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in
a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, or cause hypervisor
memory corruption.  We cannot rule out a guest being able to escalate
its privilege.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

x86 HVM guests cannot exploit this vulnerability.

Only x86 PV guests can exploit this vulnerability, and only when being
run in shadow mode.  PV guests are typically run in shadow mode for live
migration, as well as for features like VM snapshot.

Note that save / restore does *not* use shadow mode, and so does not
expose this vulnerability.  Some downstreams also include a "non-live
migration" feature, which also does not use shadow mode (and thus does
not expose this vulnerability).

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM guests avoids the vulnerability.

Avoiding live migration of x86 PV guests also avoids the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201801-14**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, the worst of which
could allow for privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.9.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.9.1-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.9.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.9.1-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the Xen (QEMU) process on the host, gain privileges on the
host system, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.9.1-r1"

```

All Xen tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.9.1-r1"

```

Package        : xen
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-17563 CVE-2017-17564 CVE-2017-17565
                 CVE-2017-17566

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor:

CVE-2017-17563

    Jan Beulich discovered that an incorrect reference count overflow
    check in x86 shadow mode may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17564

    Jan Beulich discovered that improper x86 shadow mode reference count
    error handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-17565

    Jan Beulich discovered that an incomplete bug check in x86 log-dirty
    handling may result in denial of service.

CVE-2017-17566

    Jan Beulich discovered that x86 PV guests may gain access to
    internally used pages which could result in denial of service or
    potential privilege escalation.

In addition this update ships the "Comet" shim to address the Meltdown
class of vulnerabilities for guests with legacy PV kernels. In addition,
the package provides the "Xen PTI stage 1" mitigation which is built-in
and enabled by default on Intel systems, but can be disabled with
`xpti=false' on the hypervisor command line (It does not make sense to
use both xpti and the Comet shim.)

Please refer to the following URL for more details on how to configure
individual mitigation strategies:
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html>

Additional information can also be found in README.pti and README.comet.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.3+comet2+shim4.10.0+comet3-1+deb9u4.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
