Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17688:

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-17688 is related to a vulnerability discovered in the OpenPGP standard, specifically in the Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode of operation. This vulnerability, known as "Efail," allows an attacker to potentially exfiltrate the plaintext of encrypted emails by manipulating the ciphertext and leveraging vulnerabilities in email clients. While the vulnerability exists in the OpenPGP standard, the severity is greatly increased by implementation flaws in email clients that do not properly handle Modification Detection Codes (MDCs), thus failing to detect ciphertext modification.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause lies in the malleability of the CFB mode used in OpenPGP, which allows an attacker to make controlled modifications to the ciphertext. Additionally, email clients not correctly implementing and checking the MDC, which is meant to detect alterations, fail to protect against these changes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **CFB Malleability:** The CFB mode allows attackers to manipulate the ciphertext to inject malicious content.
2.  **MDC Handling Issues:** Email clients failing to correctly handle or ignoring MDC warnings. This means that a modified encrypted message will still be decrypted and displayed to the user, thus enabling the attack.
3.  **Direct Exfiltration:** Email clients concatenating HTML parts of a multipart email message improperly, allowing for an image tag to span across a decrypted section of the message, exfiltrating the plaintext through the URL.
4.  **Obsolete Packet Type:** Some clients accept the obsolete "Symmetrically Encrypted" packet type which does not provide modification detection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of the plaintext of encrypted emails. An attacker with access to encrypted emails can modify the ciphertext, send it to the victim, and, if the email client is vulnerable, the modified message will be decrypted, and plaintext exfiltrated to the attacker via a crafted URL.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **CBC/CFB Gadget Attacks:** Attackers modify the ciphertext to include malicious HTML (e.g., an image tag) that, upon decryption and rendering by the vulnerable client, loads an external resource, effectively leaking the plaintext through the crafted URL.
2.  **Direct Exfiltration:** Attackers create a malicious multipart email with an HTML part including an unclosed image tag before the ciphertext, allowing plaintext exfiltration via a URL including the decrypted content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Access to Encrypted Emails:** Attackers need access to the encrypted emails. This could be achieved through various means such as network eavesdropping, compromised email accounts, or access to email servers or backups.
2.  **Ability to Send Modified Emails:** Attackers must be able to send the manipulated encrypted emails to the victim.
3.  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Email Clients:** Attackers need to target users with vulnerable email clients.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not in the core cryptographic principles of OpenPGP but rather in the implementation of the standard in email clients and, to a lesser extent, in the malleability of CFB mode.
*   The Modification Detection Code (MDC) was implemented in GnuPG to counter this issue and has been available since 2000. If the MDC is missing or invalid, GnuPG will return an error, but email clients need to properly handle this error to avoid being vulnerable.
*   The attack is not specific to PGP, similar techniques can be used against S/MIME
*   The "Direct Exfiltration" attacks have been shown to work against Apple Mail, iOS Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird.
*   ProtonMail claims to be unaffected as it encrypts all emails on the server-side and does not mix plaintext and ciphertext in a manner that can be exploited.

The provided content also includes information on mitigations including, not decrypting emails within email clients and disabling HTML rendering. Long term mitigations include updating the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards.
