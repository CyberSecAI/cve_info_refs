# Exploit Title: GPS-SERVER.NET SAAS CMS <=3.0 Multiple Vulnerabilities
# Exploit Author: Noman Riffat
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.gps-server.net/
# Software Link: http://www.gps-server.net/
# Version: <=3.0
# Tested on: Linux and Windows
# CVE : CVE-2017-17097, CVE-2017-17098

GPS-SERVER.NET SAAS CMS Version <=3.0 Suffers from multiple vulnerabilities
which results in complete takeover of the target remotely.

1. Remote Code Injection (Works until version 3.0)

The writeLog function in fn_common.php in gps-server.net GPS Tracking
Software (self hosted) through 3.0 allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary PHP code via a crafted request that is mishandled during admin
log viewing. Login, signup and other common incidents are logged into a PHP
file in /logs/ directory with the given input. For example an attacker can
use PHP code in password recovery mode instead of email which will be
injected into the PHP log file.

Demo:

Go to the vulnerable site
Click recover tab
Give following code in email field, fill captcha and click submit
<?php system($_GET[cmd]); ?>
Unfortunately each and every POST request in the CMS is going through
function mysql_real_escape_string() which will add slashes behind every
quote in the payload. So you have to make sure your payload doesn't contain
any quote. Fortunately, PHP is flexible enough to allow a string without
having quotes as you can see in above payload it doesn't contain quotes
around "cmd" but it still works. The shell can then be collected from here
https://localhost/logs/YYYY_MM_user_access.php
YYYY=Current Year
MM=Current Month
Use the payload carefully. If you messed it up, PHP log file will get
corrupted and then wait until next month so CMS generates a new log file
for you :)
Unfortunately the header of log files only allows admin session to access
log data which makes it less of a RCE. Code will only be executed if admin
checks the log files. But fortunately there is another vulnerability
(explained below) which allows an attacker to hijack admin's account hence
making the RCE exploitable with 100% success.

2. Password Reset Vulnerability (Tested upto version 2.7)

gps-server.net GPS Tracking Software (self hosted) 2.x has a password reset
procedure that immediately resets passwords upon an unauthenticated
request, and then sends e-mail with a predictable (date-based) password to
the admin, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by
predicting this new password. This is related to the use of gmdate()
function for password creation in fn_connect.php.

Demo:

Go to the vulnerable site
Click recover tab
Input admin's email, fill captcha and click submit. Now execute following
PHP code on your local machine immediately.

<?php
for($seconds=-10;$seconds<10;$seconds++){
echo substr(hash('sha1',gmdate('d F Y G i s u',
time()+$seconds)),0,6).'<br>';
}
?>

Submitting password reset form and executing above should be done parallel
to predict password as close as possible. Unfortunately i couldn't make
full remote exploit because of the captcha in the password reset form. This
code will predict possible 20 passwords generated in 20 seconds. It might
not be possible to have synchronized timing on your local machine and
target's server so this code generates 20 passwords (10 before actual time
and 10 after).  Set your local machine's time as accurate as you can to get
the perfect combo :)
Password reset vulnerability is tested up to version 2.7 but doesn't work
on version 3.0 which means it was fixed somewhere in between version 2.7
and 3.0 and since the CMS isn't open source so I can't say when it got
fixed (I only had source code of version 2.5.9 and 2.7). Even though the
reset vulnerability was patched unintentionally as developers added a
mid-step in password reset procedure. CMS sends password reset link to the
admin's email and password is only reset once admin clicks the link. Since
we don't know when admin is gonna click the link so we can't predict the
new password.

Mitigation: Update CMS to version 3.1

Give me feedback @nomanriffat :)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
