```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by a missing reset of the report_counter variable in the res_rtp_asterisk module when processing multiple RTCP RR/SR report blocks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Memory corruption: The logic in res\_rtp\_asterisk, which handles RTCP RR/SR record report blocks, does not reset the report\_counter between processing RR/SR records. This leads to writing data outside of the allocated memory on subsequent RR/SR records within the same packet.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service: The memory corruption can lead to crashes.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted RTCP packet containing multiple RR/SR report blocks.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted RTCP packet to the vulnerable Asterisk instance.
