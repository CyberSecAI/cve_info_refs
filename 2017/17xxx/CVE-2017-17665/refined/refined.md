{
  "CVE-2017-17665": {
    "Description": "The machine update process in Octopus Deploy does not check that the user has access to all environments. An authenticated user with access to some environments could add a different environment (that they do not have access to) to a machine's scope if that machine already has an environment that the user has access to.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient access control checks during the machine update process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization",
      "Inadequate verification of user permissions"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated user can gain access to machines and environments they are not authorized to access by adding a new environment to the scope of a machine that the user can already access.",
     "Attack vectors": "Network access to the Octopus Deploy server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An authenticated user with access to at least one environment within Octopus Deploy. The user needs to have network access to the Octopus Deploy server"
  }
