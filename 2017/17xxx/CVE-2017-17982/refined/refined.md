The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in a "Muslim Matrimonial Script". The vulnerabilities described are:

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present in multiple admin pages, including `event_edit.php`, `slider_edit.php`, `state_view.php`, and `caste_view.php`.
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the query parameters (`edit_id`, `cou_id`, `comm_id`) of the vulnerable URLs. The injected script is then executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted link.
*  **Impact:**  An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious JavaScript and trick a user into visiting the URL, or embed it into a website the user visits.

**2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Vulnerability:**  A stored XSS vulnerability exists in `event_add.php`.
*   **Root Cause:**  The application does not sanitize user-provided input when adding a new event. The `event_title` parameter is stored in the database, and then displayed without sanitization.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript through the `event_title` parameter when creating a new event. This payload is then stored in the database and executed when any user views the event.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to reflected XSS, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of users who view the stored content, leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to access the `event_add.php` and submit a POST request containing the malicious JavaScript payload in the `event_title` parameter.

**3. SQL Injection**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerability in `view-rofile.php`.
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the `mem_id` parameter, which is decoded from Base64 before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `mem_id` parameter after base64 decoding.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive database information, modify data, or even gain control over the database server.
*  **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to craft the malicious SQL payload into the base64 encoded mem_id parameter.

**4. Arbitrary File Upload**

*   **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in `mydetails_edit.php`.
*   **Root Cause:**  The application does not restrict the type of files that users can upload through the `user_photo` parameter.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can upload any type of file, including web shells with malicious code, through the `user_photo` parameter.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can upload and execute malicious files on the server, potentially leading to complete control of the web server.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs to access `mydetails_edit.php` and submit a POST request with the malicious file through the `user_photo` parameter.

**5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Vulnerability:** CSRF vulnerability in `subadmin_edit.php`.
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not use CSRF protection tokens when submitting requests.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML form that, when visited by an authenticated user, will force the user's browser to submit a request to `subadmin_edit.php` with attacker-controlled parameters.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions they did not intend, such as changing sensitive settings like passwords.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to craft an HTML page that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint, and trick a logged-in user into visiting the page. The attacker does not need access to the user panel.
