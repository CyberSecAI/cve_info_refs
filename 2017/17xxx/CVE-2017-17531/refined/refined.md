{
  "CVE-2017-17531": {
    "description": "gozilla.c in GNU GLOBAL 4.8.6 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `gozilla.c` program in GNU GLOBAL does not properly sanitize or validate the input URL string before passing it to the system's default web browser, which is determined by the `BROWSER` environment variable.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Improper Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system. This can result in a complete compromise of the affected host, data breaches, and denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted URL",
         "Manipulated BROWSER Environment Variable"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing shell metacharacters and potentially modify the BROWSER environment variable to point to a malicious executable."
    },
    "affected_versions": {
        "vulnerable": "GNU GLOBAL versions before 6.6.1.",
        "fixed_versions": "GNU GLOBAL 6.6.1 and later."
     },
    "remediation": "Users are advised to upgrade to GNU GLOBAL version 6.6.1 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability stems from the program's reliance on the system shell to execute the browser command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands via a specially crafted URL."
