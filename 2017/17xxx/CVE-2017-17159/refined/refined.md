- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of System Information (SI) messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of malformed System Information (SI) messages leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a device restart, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker within radio range of the vulnerable device can send specially crafted SI messages via a wireless device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within radio range and have the capability to send malformed System Information messages via a specialized wireless device.
