Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17753:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `esb-cie-import-export-page.php` file of the CSV Import-Export WordPress plugin. Specifically, HTTP GET parameters (`cie_type`, `cie_import`, `cie_update`, and `cie_ignore`) are directly echoed back into the HTML output without any filtering or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable parameters. This can lead to:
*   Stealing cookies and session tokens
*   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
*   Defacing the website
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests. The attacker crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `cie_type`, `cie_import`, `cie_update`, or `cie_ignore` parameters. When a user (typically an admin accessing the plugin's admin page) visits this crafted URL, the JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be able to:
*   Craft HTTP GET requests.
*  Have knowledge of a vulnerable WordPress installation using the CSV Import-Export plugin.

The attacker does not need privileged access to the WordPress instance in order to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is exploitable on the admin page of the plugin and an attacker would likely target WordPress administrators.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in version 1.1 of the plugin.
* The plugin has been closed due to the security issue and is not available for download anymore.
* The vendor was contacted multiple times but failed to respond adequately.
*   The vulnerable code is located on line 21 of `includes/admin/views/esb-cie-import-export-page.php` in the plugin.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) URL is provided.
* There is no fix available in the provided content as the plugin was closed.
