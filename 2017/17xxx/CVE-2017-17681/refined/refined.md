{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop in the `ReadPSDChannelZip` function within the `coders/psd.c` file when processing a crafted PSD image file, specifically during the inflate operation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is an uncontrolled loop in the zlib inflate processing when handling a malformed PSD file, leading to a denial-of-service condition due to high CPU usage.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted PSD image to ImageMagick, leading to 100% CPU consumption and potentially making the system unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves providing a malicious PSD image file to ImageMagick for processing. This could be done by tricking a user or an automated system into opening the crafted image.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to get the ImageMagick software to process the malicious PSD file. This could mean the attacker has a system that is using ImageMagick to process external files, or they are able to convince a user to process a file."
