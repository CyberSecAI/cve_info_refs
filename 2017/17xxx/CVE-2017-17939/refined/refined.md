**Vulnerabilities Detailed in the content:**

1.  **Reflected XSS:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `theatreid` parameter in `viewtheatre.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows arbitrary JavaScript execution through a crafted URL.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft the malicious URL and trick the victim into clicking it.

2.  **Stored XSS:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `title` parameter in `sitesettings.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows storing arbitrary JavaScript within the application's database.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious script can be executed every time the stored data is displayed to a user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** POST request to `sitesettings.php` with malicious JavaScript within the title parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to submit the POST request with the crafted payload

3.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `movieid` parameter in `movieview.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows direct SQL queries to be crafted through the vulnerable parameter, thus leading to database manipulation
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can access sensitive data, modify data, or potentially take over the database server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious `movieid` query string parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft the SQL injection payload within the URL.

4.  **CSRF:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper CSRF protection on the `sitesettings.php` endpoint.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows an attacker to trick a logged-in user into submitting unintended requests.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can change sensitive settings on behalf of the user, including injecting stored XSS payload
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious HTML page containing a crafted POST request to `sitesettings.php`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening a malicious webpage while being logged in to the application.
