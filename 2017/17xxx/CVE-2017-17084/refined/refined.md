Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the IWARP_MPA dissector of Wireshark. A malformed packet can trigger a crash in the dissector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The IWARP_MPA dissector is vulnerable to a crash due to improper handling of malformed packets. Specifically the issue is related to the dissection of malformed packets by the IWARP_MPA dissector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition as the Wireshark application crashes. This prevents the user from analyzing network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting a malformed IWARP_MPA packet onto the network or convincing a user to open a pcap file containing such packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to either inject a crafted packet into a network being monitored by Wireshark, or to send a crafted pcap file to a user. The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark versions 2.4.3 and 2.2.11
- The issue was identified via fuzzing as indicated by the bug report title, "Buildbot crash output: fuzz-2017-11-20-16253.pcap".
