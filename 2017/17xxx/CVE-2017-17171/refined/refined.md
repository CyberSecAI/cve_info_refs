- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper processing of malicious parameters by some Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to the incorrect handling of specific parameters sent to the smartphone driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a system restart (denial of service).
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application (APK). Then, the attacker can leverage a pre-installed app with specific permissions to send malicious parameters to the smartphone's driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to install a malicious app. The attacker also needs to exploit a pre-installed application that has necessary permissions to interact with the phone's driver.
