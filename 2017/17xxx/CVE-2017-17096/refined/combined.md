It seemed to still work as of May 2019. Had an initial rookie mistake of inserting hotlinked URLS into the shortlinks, but once that was resolved it seems to work for about a minute, then BAM added a third and the site borked, white page with error message
“The site is experiencing technical difficulties. Please check your site admin email inbox for instructions.”
Had to deactivate plugin.
1 star. If it worked, 5 stars.

AFAICS, this works fine on Wordpress 5.2. I don’t have any visible errors. It’s a shame it hasn’t been updated to include a Gutenberg block as manually typing in shortcodes over and over is a bit laborious (or in my case, duplicating the previously made shortcode block then changing the URL).

I love this! It is so easy to use and elegant result! Wiuth the shortcode it even works in a elementor carousel.
I only wish one addition: being able to add an image when there is none (and not just a default placeholder)
Thanks!

### [Good – but don´t use it in Germany to avoid copyright lawsuits](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/good-but-dont-use-it-in-germany-to-avoid-copyright-lawsuits/)

The plugin is technically great.
But in Germany, where I live, you can get sued for violation of copyrights when you embed content this way, especially the pictures. I was just warned that a lawyer wants to sue unless I desist from showing the picture of an embedded article.
So my suggestion to the programmer: include an option page where one can choose:
-show headlines
-show teasertext
-show pictures
