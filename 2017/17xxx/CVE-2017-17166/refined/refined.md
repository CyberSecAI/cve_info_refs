- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper processing of a specific field within H.323 messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software fails to correctly handle a certain field in H.323 messages. This leads to a resource exhaustion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making certain services unavailable due to stack memory exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted H.323 message to the vulnerable device. The attacker must have network access to the target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the target device and be able to send crafted H.323 messages. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
