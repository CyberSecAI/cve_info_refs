- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple SAML implementation vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to a SAML-enabled Splunk Web instance or allow an authenticated user to impersonate another user or role.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to a SAML-enabled Splunk Web, and an authenticated user can impersonate another user or role.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is possible via SAML authentication when enabled on Splunk Web.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the Splunk Web interface with SAML authentication enabled. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit some vulnerabilities.
