- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries within the handling of NVBUBackup PluginList method requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Quest NetVault Backup in the context of the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated requests to the NVBUBackup PluginList method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required.
