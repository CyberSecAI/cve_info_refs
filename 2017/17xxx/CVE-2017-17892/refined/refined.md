The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the "Readymade Video Sharing Script". These vulnerabilities include SQL Injection, Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, and CSRF.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Reflected XSS:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when reflecting it back in the HTTP response, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and proper output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to account hijacking, stealing session cookies, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs that include JavaScript code, attackers can trick users into clicking these links, leading to code execution within their browsers.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious URLs. Victim needs to be tricked into clicking the URL.

2.  **Stored XSS:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application stores unsanitized user input in the database. This unsanitized data is later retrieved and rendered in the user's browser without proper encoding.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization before storing the data, lack of output encoding when displaying the data.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject persistent JavaScript payloads into the application. This allows the attacker to execute malicious scripts whenever the compromised data is displayed to users.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can submit malicious script through the user profile edit form which is later displayed to users when they view the profile.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to access the profile edit page and ability to send POST request.

3.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization and the use of user-supplied data directly in SQL queries.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Failure to sanitize user input before using it in database queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to access, modify, or delete database information.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** The `search` and `chnlid` parameters in `search_video.php` and `viewsubs.php`, respectively, are vulnerable.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to access the vulnerable parameters in the affected URLs, knowledge of SQL.

4.  **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms. The application does not properly validate the origin of requests when updating user profile information.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Missing CSRF protection.
    *  **Impact:**  An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unintentionally submitting requests to the application, such as modifying profile settings, by embedding a malicious form in a different site/email.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML demonstrates how a malicious site can craft a POST request to `user-profile-edit.php`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to load an attacker-controlled webpage or email. The attacker can use the CSRF vulnerability to inject a stored-XSS payload.
