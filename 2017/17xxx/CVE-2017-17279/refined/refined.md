- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The soundtrigger module in some Huawei smartphones has an authentication bypass vulnerability due to improper design.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the soundtrigger module.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to wake up the phone and control it to send short messages and make calls within audio range to the phone.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must trick the user into installing a malicious application. Also, the attacker needs to be within audio range of the phone to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must first trick the user into installing a malicious application. The attacker must also be within audio range of the device when exploiting the vulnerability.
