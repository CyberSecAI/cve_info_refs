**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries within the handling of `NVBUScheduleSet Get` method requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the underlying database.

**Attack vectors:** Network based attack via specifically crafted requests to the `NVBUScheduleSet Get` method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require authentication.
