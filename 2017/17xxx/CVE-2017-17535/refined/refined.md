    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `lib/gui.py` file of gjots2 version 2.4.1. The application does not sanitize user-controlled input, specifically the BROWSER environment variable, before passing it to the system command. This can allow a malicious user to inject additional arguments to the command when a browser is launched. The affected versions of Ubuntu include 18.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS."
