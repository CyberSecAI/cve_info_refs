Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Piwigo 2.9.2:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Piwigo application. User-supplied input is directly rendered into the HTML output without proper filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are stored within the application's database (or configuration) and executed when a user views the affected pages.

The specific vulnerable instances are:
  - `/admin.php?page=batch_manager&mode=unit`, specifically within the `tags-*[]` POST parameters.
  - `/admin.php?page=configuration&section=main`, specifically within the `gallery_title` POST parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application which would be executed in the context of the user's browser.
- This can lead to various attacks like:
  - Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
  - Defacing the website.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Accessing sensitive data from the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST requests** to the mentioned vulnerable endpoints by manipulating the vulnerable input fields of the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access or the ability to manipulate form submissions to these admin panel endpoints.
- The attacker must have the capability to send HTTP POST requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example demonstrates the vulnerability in the `/admin.php?page=configuration&section=main` endpoint.
- The attacker injects `<title><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` into the `gallery_title` parameter.
- When the page is rendered, the injected script executes, displaying an alert box containing the document's domain.
- The vulnerability is confirmed to be stored, meaning the script persists and will execute every time the configuration page is loaded until remediated.

**Remediation:**
- The report recommends implementing "Context Specific Filtering," which involves sanitizing user inputs based on the context where they are being displayed to prevent XSS.

**Vendor Patch:**
- The vendor patch is available at the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/commit/c3b4c6f7f0ddeaea492080fb8211d7b4cfedaf6f
