- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper exception handling when processing malformed packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper handling of malformed packets during the exception handling process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain higher privileges on the affected smartphone.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires tricking a user into installing a malicious application, which allows the attacker to craft malformed packets and exploit a vulnerability in the exception handling process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Requires an authenticated, local attacker.
    - The attacker must trick the user into installing a malicious application.
    - The attacker then crafts malformed packets to trigger the vulnerability during the exception handling process.
