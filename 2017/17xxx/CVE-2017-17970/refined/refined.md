Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17970:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is SQL injection vulnerability in multiple parameters of the Muviko 1.1 application

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the following parameters:
  - `email` parameter in `login.php` (POST request)
  - `season_id` parameter in `load_season.php` (GET request)
  - `movie_id` parameter in `get_rating.php` (GET request)
  - `movie_id` and `rating` parameters in `update_rating.php` (GET request)
  - `id` parameter in `set_player_source.php` (GET request)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities to:
  - Extract sensitive data from the database.
  - Bypass authentication by injecting malicious SQL queries into the login form.
  - Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
  - Execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are the vulnerable parameters within the identified PHP files, specifically using HTTP GET and POST requests:
  - Crafted HTTP POST request to `login.php` with malicious SQL in `email` parameter.
  - Crafted HTTP GET request to `themes/flixer/ajax/load_season.php` with malicious SQL in `season_id` parameter.
  - Crafted HTTP GET request to `themes/flixer/ajax/get_rating.php` with malicious SQL in `movie_id` parameter.
  - Crafted HTTP GET request to `themes/flixer/ajax/update_rating.php` with malicious SQL in `movie_id` and `rating` parameters.
  - Crafted HTTP GET request to `themes/flixer/ajax/set_player_source.php` with malicious SQL in `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Muviko application.
  - No authentication is needed for exploiting the SQL injection in the `load_season.php`, `get_rating.php`, `update_rating.php` and `set_player_source.php` files. However, exploiting the SQL injection in login.php would require the attacker to have knowledge of a valid username to inject SQL into the email parameter.
