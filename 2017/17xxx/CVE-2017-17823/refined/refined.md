Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Piwigo 2.9.2 (CVE-2017-17823):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the Piwigo application. User-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without using parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the following areas:
*   `/admin/user_list_backend.php` : The `sSortDir_0` POST parameter is vulnerable.
*   `/admin.php?page=batch_manager&mode=unit` : The `element_ids` POST parameter is vulnerable.
*   `/admin.php?page=configuration&section=main` : The `order_by[]` POST parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
*   Gain unauthorized access to the underlying MySQL database.
*   Extract sensitive information, including usernames and passwords, as shown in the provided examples.
*   Potentially modify or delete database records.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are the vulnerable POST parameters in the specified admin panel pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability details are provided in the "Proof of Concept" sections, including the crafted POST request payloads to demonstrate the SQL injection.
* The vulnerable parameters directly inject SQL code into the queries, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. For example:

    * In `user_list_backend.php`, the `sSortDir_0` parameter is injected with SQL to extract username and password
   `sSortDir_0=`and+extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select group_concat(username,password) from piwigo_users limit 0,1)))+--+`
   * In `admin.php?page=batch_manager&mode=unit`, the `element_ids` parameter is injected with SQL to extract username and password:
 `element_ids=12%2c13`)+union select group_concat(username,0x3a,password,0x3c62723e),2 from piwigo_users+--+`
    * In `admin.php?page=configuration&section=main`, the `order_by[]` parameter is injected with SQL to extract the database user:
    `order_by%5B%5D=`extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select user())))`
*  The responses show that the injected SQL queries are executed and output results of the query, such as username and password.
* The configuration vulnerability's impact is reflected publicly via the `index.php` page

**Remediation:**
The report recommends implementing a centralized controller that uses parameterized queries and input validation to sanitize user input.

**Vendor Patches:**

The vendor patches for the vulnerabilities are available at:
*   [Admin/Users](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/commit/33a03e9afb8fb00c9d8f480424d549311fe03d40)
*   [Batch Manager](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/commit/f7c8e0a947a857ff5d31dafd03842df41959b84c)
*   [Configuration](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/commit/91ef7909a5c51203f330cbecf986472900b60983)
The patch for the configuration vulnerability, introduces the check_input_parameter function to validate the order_by input parameter against a regular expression.
