Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-17565:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An incomplete bug check in the x86 log-dirty handling within the Xen hypervisor. Specifically, an assertion that an M2P (machine to physical address translation table) entry is not a special "shared" indicator was insufficiently qualified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is present in the logic that handles memory sharing for x86 HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests.
- The insufficient qualification of the bug check allows PV (Paravirtualized) guests to trigger it.
- The vulnerability is exposed when PV guests are in log-dirty mode (e.g., during live migration or VM snapshot).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious or buggy PV guest can cause a hypervisor crash.
- This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious PV guest can trigger the bug check.
- Specifically, the guest must be in log-dirty mode (which happens when being live migrated or using VM snapshot features).
- The guest needs to manipulate M2P entries corresponding to its owned pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have control over a PV guest on an x86 system.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the log-dirty mode of the guest, typically by initiating a live migration or using VM snapshot features.
- The attacker needs the ability to manipulate M2P entries of their guest.
