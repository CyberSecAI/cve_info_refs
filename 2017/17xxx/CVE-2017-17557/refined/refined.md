{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow during the calculation of the destination buffer size, which is based on the `biWidth` attribute from a bitmap image header. The calculation does not properly account for large `biWidth` values, leading to a smaller than required buffer being allocated. Subsequent writes into this undersized buffer cause a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow in buffer size calculation",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient buffer size",
       "Missing boundary check during data copy operation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution by overflowing the heap buffer allocated for bitmap image data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a malicious PDF document that includes a specially crafted bitmap image with an overlong `biWidth` attribute."
        ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF document with a specially crafted bitmap image and convince a user to open this document."
