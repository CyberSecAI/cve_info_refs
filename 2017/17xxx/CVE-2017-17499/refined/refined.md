Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17499:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A missing return statement in the `Magick::Image::read` function within the ImageMagick library. This caused a use-after-free vulnerability. Specifically, when no image is loaded, the function would throw an exception using `throwExceptionExplicit` but wouldn't return. This allowed subsequent code to execute with the freed image data, leading to a heap-use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The `Magick::Image::read` function didn't properly handle the case where no image is loaded. It would free the `exceptionInfo` but then continue executing, trying to use the same pointer after it had been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: A crafted image could cause a program using ImageMagick to crash due to the use-after-free, potentially disrupting services or applications.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated in the provided documents, a use-after-free vulnerability can sometimes be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution depending on memory layout and allocation details, though this is not guaranteed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious image files: An attacker could craft a malicious image file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `Magick::Image::read`, leading to the use-after-free.
- Triggering the vulnerable code path: Attackers would need to find a way to trick a program using ImageMagick into processing the crafted malicious image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted image to a system using the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "littleputa" of NSFOCUS Security Team.
- Patches were released to address this issue. The commit `8c35502217c1879cb8257c617007282eee3fe1cc` added the missing return to address the heap-use-after-free and commit `dd96d671e4d5ae22c6894c302e8996c13f24c45a` added an additional missing return in a different location to avoid use-after-free.
- Various distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu released security updates to address this and other ImageMagick vulnerabilities.
