Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a heap-use-after-free vulnerability within the NASM assembler. This occurs when NASM incorrectly handles certain crafted source files during preprocessing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-use-after-free:**  The vulnerability manifests as a heap-use-after-free error. This means the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause NASM to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** The vulnerability description mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution, which could allow an attacker to gain control of the system running NASM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Source Files:**  The attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into processing a malicious, specially crafted source file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input to NASM:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious source file to NASM for processing. This could be achieved through various means, such as getting a user to assemble a malicious file or exploiting a service that uses NASM.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was detected using a custom fuzzer called collAFL.
- The issue was present in NASM version 2.14rc0 and is resolved in upcoming 2.13.02.

The provided text indicates that the vulnerability is resolved in the upcoming version 2.13.02.
