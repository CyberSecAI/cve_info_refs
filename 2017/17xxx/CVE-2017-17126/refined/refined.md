Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `load_debug_section` function within the `readelf.c` file of the Binutils package. Specifically, the code attempts to access section header information without verifying if the section headers exist. This occurs when processing a malformed ELF file that is missing section headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Check:** The code does not check for the presence of section headers before attempting to access them. This leads to a null pointer dereference when the `strs` pointer is null.
- **Malformed Input Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed ELF file. The `readelf` tool fails to gracefully handle this type of input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a segmentation fault, causing the `readelf` tool to crash. This leads to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed ELF File:** An attacker crafts a malformed ELF file specifically lacking section headers.
- **Tool Invocation:** The attacker provides this malformed ELF file as input to the `readelf` command, triggering the vulnerability when the program attempts to parse the file's debug sections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft a Malformed ELF:** The attacker needs the knowledge and tools to create a specific type of ELF file that lacks section headers.
- **File System Access or User Interaction:** The attacker must be able to either place the malformed ELF file in a location where a user might inadvertently use `readelf` on it or entice a user to use `readelf` on the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided sourceware.org bug report provides a GDB backtrace which pinpoints the exact line of code causing the segmentation fault: `readelf.c:13584`, where `strs->sh_size` is accessed without validating that `strs` is not null.
- A patch was implemented in the `load_debug_section` function to check for the existence of section headers before attempting to load debug sections.
- The Gentoo security advisory also confirms that this vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted ELF file and can lead to a Denial of Service.
