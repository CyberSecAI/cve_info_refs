- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The iBMC software incorrectly performs an authorization check. A normal user can access certain information intended for admin users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must log into the system through the web portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a valid user account (normal user, not admin) and be able to access the web portal.
