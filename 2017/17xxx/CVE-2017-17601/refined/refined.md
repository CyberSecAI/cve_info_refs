Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-17601:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `city` parameter of the `service-list` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query. Specifically the `city` parameter in the `service-list` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, application configurations, and other confidential information.
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/service-list` endpoint. The malicious SQL code is injected into the `city` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not require prior authentication.
- No special access or privileges on the server are required; the attack is carried out through the web interface.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit demonstrates how to inject a `UNION SELECT` statement into the `city` parameter to extract database information such as the user, database name, and version.
- The vulnerable parameter is `city` in the URL: `http://localhost/[PATH]/service-list?city=[SQL]&main_search=`

The provided information is consistent with the typical description of a SQL Injection vulnerability.
