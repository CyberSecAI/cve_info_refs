  "CVE-2017-17513": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "TeX Live through 20170524 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL, related to linked_scripts/context/stubs/unix/mtxrun, texmf-dist/scripts/context/stubs/mswin/mtxrun.lua, and texmf-dist/tex/luatex/lualibs/lualibs-os.lua.",
      "Published Date": "2017-12-15T07:00:00",
      "Modified Date": "2024-07-24T17:01:01"
    },
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the BROWSER environment variable when launching external programs, which allows for argument injection through a crafted URL.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Argument injection vulnerability due to lack of input validation."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary arguments into the command executed by TeX Live, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the victim's system.",
    "Attack vectors": "A crafted URL, when processed by TeX Live, can inject malicious arguments into the command invoked by the application. The BROWSER environment variable needs to be manipulated to be able to control the program being launched.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to set the BROWSER environment variable to a malicious value.",
      "Ability to craft URLs."
    ],
    "Affected packages": [
        "context",
        "texlive-base",
        "texlive-bin"
     ],
    "More details": "The vulnerability affects the following files:\n- linked_scripts/context/stubs/unix/mtxrun\n- texmf-dist/scripts/context/stubs/mswin/mtxrun.lua\n- texmf-dist/tex/luatex/lualibs/lualibs-os.lua"
