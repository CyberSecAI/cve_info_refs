  "CVE-2017-17502": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Access": "Network",
      "Complexity": "Medium",
      "Authentication": "None",
      "Confidentiality": "Partial",
      "Integrity": "Partial",
      "Availability": "Partial"
    },
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the `ReadCMYKImage` function within `coders/cmyk.c` due to insufficient bounds checking when processing CMYK images.",
    "Vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow when reading CMYK image formats",
     "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious CMYK image file. This could lead to a denial of service (application crash), disclosure of in-memory information, or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted CMYK image file, making it remotely exploitable if an application using GraphicsMagick processes such files received over a network.",
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted CMYK image file to an application using GraphicsMagick for processing. No special privileges or authentication are needed."
