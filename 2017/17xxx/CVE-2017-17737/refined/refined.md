{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The BrightSign Digital Signage (4k242) device (Firmware 6.2.63 and below) suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `/network_diagnostics.html` and `/storage_info.html` due to unsanitized `REF` parameter.",
      "Directory traversal/information leakage vulnerability in `storage.html` due to unsanitized `RP` parameter.",
      "Unauthenticated file upload vulnerability in `storage.html`.",
      "Unauthenticated file rename/manipulation vulnerability in `/tools.html`."
    ],
    "impact": "Combined, these vulnerabilities allow for compromise of both end users and the device itself. A malicious attacker can upload a malicious page and steal credentials, host malicious content, or distribute content through the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By manipulating the `REF` parameter in `/network_diagnostics.html` and `/storage_info.html`, an attacker can inject malicious scripts.",
      "By manipulating the `RP` parameter in `storage.html`, an attacker can traverse the file system to access sensitive information.",
       "By accessing `storage.html`, an attacker can upload arbitrary files",
      "By accessing `/tools.html`, an attacker can rename and manipulate files."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires network access to the BrightSign device. No authentication is required to exploit the directory traversal, file upload and file manipulation vulnerabilities."
