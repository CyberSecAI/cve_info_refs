{
  "cveId": "CVE-2017-17522",
  "description": "Lib/webbrowser.py in Python through 3.6.3 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a software maintainer indicates that exploitation is impossible because the code relies on subprocess.Popen and the default shell=False setting.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `webbrowser.py` module in Python does not properly sanitize strings from the `BROWSER` environment variable before using them to launch a web browser. This lack of validation could allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments into the browser's command-line execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Argument Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions on the victim's system by crafting a malicious `BROWSER` environment variable value.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Manipulating the BROWSER environment variable"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to set the BROWSER environment variable. This could be achieved through a compromised user account, remote access, or some other means of code execution within a vulnerable environment."
  },
    "additionalNotes": [
    "Multiple sources indicate that the vulnerability is disputed, primarily due to the use of `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=False`, which prevents the shell from interpreting the injected commands. The vulnerability relies on the user modifying the BROWSER environment variable.",
    "SUSE rates this issue as having moderate severity with a local attack vector, while the NVD rates it with a network attack vector. This difference highlights the debated nature of the vulnerability.",
     "Several Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat have marked this CVE as not affected or not a bug due to the subprocess.Popen with shell=False protection."
