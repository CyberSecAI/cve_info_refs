The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in a "Muslim Matrimonial Script" application. While the content does not explicitly mention CVE-2017-17986, it details several security flaws that are typical of web applications and it is possible one of these vulnerabilities was assigned this CVE. The identified vulnerabilities are:

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within URL parameters.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly encode or sanitize user-provided input before reflecting it back in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URLs with injected JavaScript.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious link to the victim, who must click it while logged into the application.
*   **Specific Locations:**
    *   `admin/event_edit.php?edit_id=[INJECTION]`
    *   `admin/slider_edit.php?edit_id=[INJECTION]`
    *   `admin/state_view.php?cou_id=[INJECTION]`
    *   `admin/caste_view.php?comm_id=[INJECTION]`

**2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of sanitization of user input before storing it in the database, leading to the execution of stored malicious scripts when the data is retrieved and displayed.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input that is stored in the database.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored and executed when other users view the affected content. This could lead to persistent compromise of the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting the malicious script through a web form.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to submit content via a form, like adding an event.
*   **Specific Location:** `admin/event_add.php` (POST parameter: `event_title`)

**3. SQL Injection**
*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input used in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application doesn't sanitize user-controlled input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to modify the SQL query to execute malicious actions or retrieve sensitive data.
*  **Impact:** An attacker could retrieve, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database. It could potentially lead to a complete compromise of the application and its database.
*   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `mem_id` parameter in the URL with SQL injection payloads.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable URL parameter (`mem_id`) and inject SQL queries.
*  **Specific Location:** `view-rofile.php?mem_id=[INJECTION]`

**4. Arbitrary File Upload**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of file type validation or proper sanitization during file upload.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application allows the user to upload files with arbitrary extensions and content, without proper validation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g. web shells) that can be accessed through the web server to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Submitting a POST request to upload a file.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable URL and craft a specific POST request for file upload.
*   **Specific Location:** `admin/mydetails_edit.php?u_id=xxx` (POST parameter: `user_photo`)

**5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
*  **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in sensitive actions.
*  **Weaknesses:** The application doesn't implement anti-CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to verify the origin of requests.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions, such as changing user settings, modifying passwords, or injecting malicious content.
*  **Attack Vector:** Embedding a malicious form or link on a website or email that makes a request to the target application when a victim clicks it.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page that targets the vulnerable action. The victim needs to be logged in and interact with the malicious webpage.
*  **Specific Location:**  `admin/subadmin_edit.php?edit_id=9999`
