The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in the "Techno Portfolio Management Panel," not just one. However, the provided CVE ID is for a single vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the content:

**1. Information Leak:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application reveals the absolute server path in the `search.php` page when an error or specific query is made.
*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's filesystem structure, potentially aiding in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `s` parameter in the URL (`search.php?s=1'`)
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires no authentication

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user input in the `search.php` page.
*   **Weakness:** XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially stealing cookies or performing other actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious payload within the `s` parameter in the URL (`search.php?s=123%27%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E%3C%27%22>`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires no authentication

**3. SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `search.php` page.
*   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to retrieve sensitive information from the database or perform other malicious operations.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `s` parameter in the URL (`search.php?s=1`)
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires no authentication

**4. Broken Access Control:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application does not properly validate user roles when deleting feedback items.
*  **Weakness:** Broken access control vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** A normal user can delete feedback using an admin user's cookie, which they are not authorized to do
*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating cookies to assume a higher role
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user's cookie to elevate privileges

**Summary of Findings:**
The provided content describes a web application with multiple security vulnerabilities including information disclosure, XSS, SQL injection, and broken access control.  It highlights the danger of unsanitized user inputs, missing user authorization checks and the potential impact of these flaws.

**CVE Relevance:**
Since the content describes multiple vulnerabilities and the provided CVE ID is for a singular vulnerability, I cannot confirm if this content is related to the specific CVE provided as the CVE description is not available.
