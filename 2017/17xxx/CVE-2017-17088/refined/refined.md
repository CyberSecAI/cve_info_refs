Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the SyncBreeze Enterprise web server.
- The server fails to properly check the bounds when reading the Host header in an HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted Host header with an oversized value, an attacker can overwrite memory.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The server does not perform proper validation of the Host header's size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a denial of service. The buffer overflow causes the application to crash, rendering it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network. An attacker can send a malicious HTTP request from a remote machine to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server (port 80 according to the provided PoC).
- **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a basic HTTP request and be able to use HTTP version 1.1 to trigger the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, which makes it trivially exploitable for anyone who has network access to the web server of SyncBreeze.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects SyncBreeze version 10.2.12 and earlier.
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit provided uses a simple Python script to send an HTTP GET request with an oversized 'Host' header consisting of 2000 'A' characters to trigger the overflow.
- The vendor released version 10.3 to address the vulnerability.
