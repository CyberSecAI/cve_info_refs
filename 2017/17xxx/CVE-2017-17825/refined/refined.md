The provided content details Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Piwigo version 2.9.2.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it within the admin panel. Specifically, the `gallery_title` parameter in the configuration settings is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored/Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
- When other users (especially administrators) view the affected pages, the injected script will execute in their browsers.
- This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/admin.php?page=configuration&section=main`.
- Specifically, the `gallery_title` parameter within the POST request is used for the XSS injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious javascript into the application through the vulnerable fields.
