The provided content is a vulnerability report for a "Muslim Matrimonial Script" and does not relate to CVE-2017-17985. The vulnerabilities described are SQL Injection, Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, Arbitrary File Upload, and CSRF.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Multiple instances of reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present in different admin pages (`event_edit.php`, `slider_edit.php`, `state_view.php`, `caste_view.php`). These occur due to the lack of proper sanitization of input parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URL.
*   **Stored XSS:** A stored XSS vulnerability is found in `event_add.php`, where the `event_title` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to permanently store malicious scripts.
*   **SQL Injection:** A SQL injection vulnerability is present in `view-rofile.php` through the `mem_id` parameter, which is vulnerable to SQL injection via a base64 encoded value.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:**  The script allows arbitrary file uploads in `mydetails_edit.php` via the `user_photo` parameter. There is no type checking which allows an attacker to upload malicious files, including webshells.
*   **CSRF:** A CSRF vulnerability is found in the `subadmin_edit.php` page, allowing attackers to trick users into performing actions, such as changing settings.

**Root Cause:**

*   Lack of input sanitization: Insufficient filtering and encoding of user inputs, including URL parameters and POST data.
*   Lack of file type validation: The system does not validate file types when uploading.
*   Missing CSRF protection: Absence of CSRF tokens when performing sensitive actions.
*   Base64 encoded parameter exploitation: Base64 encoded parameter is used without additional security measures and allows for easy manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to account hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload malicious files, such as webshells, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick a user into unknowingly performing actions on the web application, potentially leading to unauthorized changes to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Attacker sends crafted URLs containing malicious scripts to the victim.
*   **Stored XSS:** Attacker injects malicious scripts into application input fields, and they are stored in the database and displayed to other users.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attacker manipulates URL parameters to execute malicious SQL queries.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attacker uploads malicious files through the file upload functionality in the application.
*   **CSRF:** Attacker creates a malicious web page or link that tricks the user's browser into sending unauthorized requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Ability to craft malicious URLs and trick victims into clicking on them.
*   **Stored XSS:** Ability to interact with the application, usually through account registration or access to the admin panel.
*   **SQL Injection:** Basic knowledge of SQL and the ability to craft SQL injection payloads.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Ability to access the file upload functionality.
*   **CSRF:** Ability to craft a malicious web page that tricks a user to perform actions, does not need previous authentication.
