Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a failed assertion within the `Exiv2::(anonymous namespace)::readHeader` function in `bigtiffimage.cpp` of the exiv2 library. Specifically, the assertion `size == 8` fails during the processing of a crafted TIFF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Assertion failure: The code assumes a specific size (8) for a certain part of the TIFF header, and this assumption is violated by the crafted input. This indicates a lack of proper input validation.
- Lack of error handling: Instead of gracefully handling the invalid size, the code triggers an assertion which results in program termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted TIFF file to a program utilizing the vulnerable exiv2 library. The assertion failure leads to the program crashing and becoming unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted TIFF File: The attack vector is a malicious TIFF file that causes the `size == 8` assertion to fail within the `readHeader` function.
- Remote Exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as any software using the vulnerable exiv2 library is affected by this issue, this implies the vulnerable software could be processing files from external sources such as uploaded media or files received through network protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF file to software that uses the vulnerable exiv2 library.
- No specific user privileges are needed for the attack to be successful beyond the ability to supply the malicious file to the vulnerable program.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report includes a proof-of-concept (POC) file named `poc_2.tiff` which can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was fixed in exiv2 version 0.27.0-1.el7_6 and is associated with Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2019:2101.
- The vulnerability was reported by Wei You and fixed by Jan Grulich
