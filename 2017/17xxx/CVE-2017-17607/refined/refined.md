{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject SQL commands into the application.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or even complete compromise of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the 'news-detail' page, where the application takes an ID parameter and processes it in SQL query without proper sanitization. The attack vector is through crafted requests to the 'news-detail' URL with injected SQL code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application and send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable 'news-detail' endpoint."
