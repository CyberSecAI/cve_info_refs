  "CVE-2017-17450": {
    "description": "net/netfilter/xt_osf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for add_callback and remove_callback operations, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions because the xt_osf_fingers data structure is shared across all net namespaces.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check in the `xt_osf.c` module for add_callback and remove_callback operations. This allows unprivileged users in any network namespace with CAP_NET_ADMIN to modify the global OS fingerprint list.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect access control, missing capability check. The `xt_osf_fingers` data structure is shared across all network namespaces, but proper checks were not being done to prevent modifications from unauthorized namespaces.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Local users with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` in a user-created net namespace can modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list. This can lead to unexpected behavior or potentially allow for the bypass of intended security restrictions.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local, specifically through operations performed on netlink sockets related to the `xt_osf` module, potentially from within a container.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have the ability to create network namespaces, have CAP_NET_ADMIN within that namespace, and needs to be able to send netlink messages."
