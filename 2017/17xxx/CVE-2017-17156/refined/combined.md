* Last Release Date:
  Apr 18, 2018

Summary

There have multiple vulnerabilities in the IKEv2 protocol on some Huawei products.

IKEv2 has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit it to craft special packets to trigger out-of-bounds memory write, which may further lead to system exceptions. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-03101)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-17152.

IKEv2 has a memory leak vulnerability due to memory release failure resulted from insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit it to cause memory leak, which may further lead to system exceptions. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-03102)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-17153.

IKEv2 has a DoS vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit it to cause unauthorized memory access, which may further lead to system exceptions. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-03103)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-17154.

IKEv2 has an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability due to incompliance with the 4-byte alignment requirement imposed by the MIPS CPU. An attacker could exploit it to cause unauthorized memory access, which may further lead to system exceptions. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-03110)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-17155.

IKEv2 has an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit it to craft special packets to trigger out-of-bounds memory access, which may further lead to system exceptions. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-03111)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-17156.

IKEv2 has an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit it to craft special packets to trigger out-of-bounds memory access, which may further lead to system exceptions. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-03112)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-17157.

Huawei has released software updates to fix these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:
