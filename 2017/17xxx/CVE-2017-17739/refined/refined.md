Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-17739, as well as CVE-2017-17737 and CVE-2017-17738 as they are grouped together in the content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE-2017-17737 & CVE-2017-17738 (XSS):** The `REF` parameter on `/network_diagnostics.html` and `/storage_info.html` is not sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*  **CVE-2017-17739 (Directory Traversal/Information Leakage & Unauthenticated File Upload/Manipulation):** The `RP` parameter in `STORAGE.HTML` is vulnerable to directory traversal, enabling access to sensitive files. Also, the `/storage.html` page allows for unauthenticated file uploads. The `/tools.html` page permits unauthenticated file renaming and manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized user input allows arbitrary script execution.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Improper validation of the `RP` parameter enables unauthorized file system access.
*   **Information Leakage:** The directory traversal weakness leaks sensitive system information.
*  **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The system allows uploading files without authentication.
*   **Unauthenticated File Manipulation:** The system allows renaming and manipulating files without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Arbitrary code execution, token theft, and related attacks, potentially allowing for unauthorized actions within a user's session.
*   **Directory Traversal/Information Leakage:** Leaking sensitive information and potentially compromising the device.
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload/Manipulation:** Allows an attacker to upload and manipulate files, leading to device compromise or distribution of malicious content.
*   **Combined Vulnerabilities:** Allows complete compromise of end users and the device itself, including hosting malicious content, stealing credentials, and distributing content through the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Sending a crafted URL with a malicious script in the `REF` parameter to a user via a phishing attack, or other social engineering vector.
*   **Directory Traversal/Information Leakage:** Manipulating the `RP` parameter in the URL for the `storage.html` page.
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** Accessing the `storage.html` page to upload malicious files.
*   **Unauthenticated File Manipulation:** Accessing the `tools.html` page to modify existing files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious request to the BrightSign device. This could be achieved if the attacker has access to the network or is able to trick a user into visiting a malicious link.
*   For directory traversal, file upload, and manipulation, no authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected BrightSign Digital Signage device is the 4k242 model, with firmware version 6.2.63 and below.
*   The identified vulnerabilities were addressed in firmware version 6.2.171 and newer.
