Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17641:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `preview.php` file of the Resume Clone Script version 2.0.5.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed to the `id` parameter in `preview.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Retrieval of sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Modification or deletion of existing data, potentially leading to data corruption or service disruption.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, it could be possible to escalate privileges if the database user has higher permissions than expected.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing information about the database structure, version, users and system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `preview.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** An understanding of SQL syntax is required to craft effective injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The provided exploit suggests the vulnerability is present without prior authentication.

**Exploit Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to inject a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement into the `id` parameter of the `preview.php` script.
*   The specific payload used in the example is:
    ```
    -2++/*!08888UNION*/(/*!08888SELECT*/+0x283129,0x283229,0x283329,0x283429,0x283529,0x283629,0x283729,0x283829,0x283929,CONCAT_WS(0x203a20,USER(),DATABASE(),VERSION()),0x28313129,0x28313229,0x28313329,0x28313429)--+-
    ```
* This payload retrieves the current user, database name, and version of the SQL server and some hardcoded values.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes information about the vulnerable application: "Resume Clone Script 2.0.5" by "phpscriptsmall.com".
*   The exploit is specific to this version and may not work on other versions of the script.
* The exploit was tested on Windows 7 x64 and Kali Linux x64.
* The date of the exploit is December 10, 2017.
