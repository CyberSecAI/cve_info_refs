This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker gains access to the network.

Vulnerability details:

There are three null pointer dereference vulnerabilities in H323 protocol of Huawei products. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could craft malformed packets and send the packets to the affected products. Due to insufficient validation of packets, which could be exploited to cause process crash.

HWPSIRT-2017-06297 and HWPSIRT-2017-06298:

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker gains access to the network.

Vulnerability details:

There are two out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in H323 protocol of Huawei products. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could craft malformed packets with specific parameters and send the packets to the affected products. Due to insufficient validation of packets, which could be exploited to cause process crash.

HWPSIRT-2017-06301 and HWPSIRT-2017-06302:

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker gains access to the network.

Vulnerability details:

There are several memory leak vulnerabilities in H323 protocol of Huawei products. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could craft malformed packets and send the packets to the affected products. Due to insufficient verification of the packets, successful exploit could cause a memory leak and eventual denial of service (DoS) condition.

HWPSIRT-2017-06303:
