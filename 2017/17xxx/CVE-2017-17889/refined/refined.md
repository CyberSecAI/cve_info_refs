- Rewriting the content of HTML pages.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user (if they're logged in).
- Facilitating further exploitation using frameworks like BeEF.

**Attack vectors:**
- Creating a group with malicious code in the group name.
- Updating a user profile's homepage with a malicious JavaScript URL.
