- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper management of LDAP connection resources. The LDAP clients in affected Huawei products do not properly handle connection resources when communicating with an LDAP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Resource management error vulnerability in the LDAP client implementation, leading to potential resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to the exhaustion of connection resources on the LDAP client, causing the client to become unresponsive and impacting services that rely on the LDAP functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by controlling the LDAP server and causing it to not respond to the client's requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected product and must be able to control the LDAP server. The LDAP function must also be configured in the affected product.
