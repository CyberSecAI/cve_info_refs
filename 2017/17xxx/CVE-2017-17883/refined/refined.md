The content relates to CVE-2017-17883.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to memory leaks in the `ReadPGXImage` function within the `coders/pgx.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `ReadPGXImage` function is not properly freeing allocated memory, resulting in memory leaks. This occurs when processing PGX image files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially cause the application to crash, if not handled or mitigated.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted PGX image file to the ImageMagick `magick` command via CLI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PGX file to be processed by an ImageMagick application.
