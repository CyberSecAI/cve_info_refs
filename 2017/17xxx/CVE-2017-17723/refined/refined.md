Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-17723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Heap-based buffer over-read in the `Exiv2::Image::byteSwap4` function within `image.cpp`. This function is responsible for byte swapping data within images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The `byteSwap4` function reads beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory Disclosure:**  Attackers can potentially read sensitive memory data beyond the buffer.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The over-read can cause the application to crash due to the AddressSanitizer error.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted TIFF File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted TIFF image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a malicious TIFF file to an application that uses the vulnerable `exiv2` library.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The provided AddressSanitizer output shows the exact location of the heap-buffer-overflow in `image.cpp` within the `byteSwap4` function. It also shows the call stack leading to the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability occurs during the processing of TIFF images and specifically affects the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function, which calls the vulnerable `byteSwap4` function.
*   The provided bug report from Red Hat includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) file to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `exiv2-0.27.0-1.el7_6`
* The gentoo security advisory confirms the vulnerability as a remote exploitable DoS or information disclosure
* The gentoo advisory lists this as one of several CVEs fixed in the version 0.26_p20180811-r3
