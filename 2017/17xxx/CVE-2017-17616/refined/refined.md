Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17616:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `city` parameter of the `event-list` functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive information stored in the database by exploiting this vulnerability. This includes accessing user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
*   **Information disclosure:** By injecting specific SQL queries, the attacker can extract data from the database, such as user information, database structure and versions.
*   **Privilege escalation:** In some cases, depending on the database permissions, an attacker might be able to gain higher privileges or control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `event-list` endpoint, specifically the `city` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's server.
*   **Understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to know how to craft malicious SQL queries that can be injected into the vulnerable parameter to extract information or modify data.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit demonstrates a UNION-based SQL injection technique.
*   The vulnerable application is "Event Search Script 1.0".
*   The vulnerable parameter is the `city` parameter in the URL `http://localhost/[PATH]/event-list?city=[SQL]&main_search=`.
*   The exploit example demonstrates how to extract database user, name, and version.
