The provided content details vulnerabilities found in the "cell blog" system, and it includes both SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. While the content does not directly mention CVE-2017-17949, it is possible that the mentioned vulnerabilities might be related if the CVE is associated with the "cell blog" system. However, without the official description for CVE-2017-17949, it's hard to say for sure.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the provided content:

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**

*   **Root cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing web pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the page.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist in the system.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing user credentials or sensitive information
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
*   **Attack vectors:** Malicious input is injected via the URL parameters `fmid` and `jfdname`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload and trick the victim into clicking the link.

**SQLi (SQL Injection):**

*   **Root cause:** The application constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  The `ptid` parameter in `pub_readpost.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database
    *   Modify data within the database
    *   Potentially gain access to the database server
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the `ptid` parameter, which can be manipulated via the URL.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries in the `ptid` parameter.

**Summary of vulnerabilities found:**

*   **XSS1:** Located in `pub_readpost.php` via the `fmid` parameter.
*   **XSS2:** Located in `fotos/` via the `jfdname` parameter.
*   **SQLi:** Located in `pub_readpost.php` via the `ptid` parameter.
