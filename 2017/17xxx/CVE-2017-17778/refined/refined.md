The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities found in the "Paid To Read Script", which include:

**1. Sensitive Information Leak:**
   - **Root Cause:**  The application discloses the absolute file path when an invalid parameter value is provided.
   - **Weakness:** Lack of proper error handling and input validation.
   - **Impact:**  Reveals the server's internal file structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending HTTP requests to specific PHP pages with invalid parameter values (e.g., `uid=12'`).
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities required; the attacker can be unauthenticated.

**2. Unauthorized Access:**
   - **Root Cause:**  Lack of authentication checks before allowing access to admin panel pages.
   - **Weakness:** Insufficient access controls.
   - **Impact:**  Allows access to sensitive admin functionalities and data without login.
   - **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing specific admin panel pages by manipulating URL parameters (e.g., `fn=7` or `uid=13`).
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities required; the attacker can be unauthenticated.

**3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` and `uid` parameters of `referrals.php` and `userview.php`, respectively.
   - **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/output encoding.
   - **Impact:** Allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript, which could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or further exploitation on the victim's browser.
   - **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious URLs with JavaScript payloads in parameters (e.g., `tier=1'%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E%3C%27%22`).
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to lure a user to click the malicious link.

**4. SQL Injection:**
   - **Root Cause:**  Unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of `referrals.php` is directly used in SQL queries.
   - **Weakness:**  Lack of input sanitization and usage of parameterized queries.
   - **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `id` parameter in `referrals.php` to inject SQL code (e.g., `id=10&tier=1`).
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can be unauthenticated.
