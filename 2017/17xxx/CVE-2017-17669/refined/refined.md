Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17669:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read in the `Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::keyTXTChunk` function within the `pngchunk_int.cpp` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This occurs when processing a crafted PNG file, specifically within the `keyTXTChunk` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. The over-read can cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious PNG File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted PNG file designed to trigger the buffer over-read in the `keyTXTChunk` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted PNG file. No specific privileges are required beyond the ability to provide input to the application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a user or system to process the malicious image using the vulnerable `exiv2` library.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided github issue #187 contains the stack trace, crash information and the Proof of Concept (POC).
*   The debian security advisory DLA-3265-1 also mentions this vulnerability with other CVE's
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3852-1 confirms that this vulnerability was also present and fixed in Ubuntu.
*   The vulnerable function is `Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::keyTXTChunk` in `src/pngchunk_int.cpp`.
