Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17614:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `city` parameter of the `list` endpoint of the "Food Order Script 1.0" web application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user input in the `city` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (extracting sensitive information from the database)
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
    - Database server compromise in severe cases.
    - Access to usernames, passwords, and other sensitive database information as shown in the Proof of Concept.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the `/list` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `city` parameter.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted URL containing SQL injection payloads within the `city` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote (no need for local access).
- Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
