The provided content describes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in WebKit's `WTF::FastBitVector` implementation, specifically within the `FastBitVectorWordOwner::resizeSlow` function. This vulnerability is due to a misuse of the `memcpy` function during resizing operations.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `FastBitVectorWordOwner::resizeSlow` function uses `memcpy` to copy data from the old bit vector array to a new array after resizing. The size of data to be copied is calculated based on the old bit vector size (`arrayLength()`), while the allocated memory for the new array is calculated based on the new requested size, which might be smaller. If the old size is larger than the new size, `memcpy` will read past the bounds of the destination buffer and result in a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow in the `memcpy` operation within `FastBitVectorWordOwner::resizeSlow` when the old size is bigger than the new size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow could lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite other data in memory, leading to unpredictable behavior of WebKit.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In the worst case, if an attacker can carefully craft the bit vector sizes, this could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a call to `FastBitVector::resize`. Specifically, the attack vector is that `FastBitVector::resize` can be called with a smaller `numBits` value than what `FastBitVector` was using previously. This path leads to the `resizeSlow` function being called, which contains the vulnerable memcpy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the size of the bit vector and force the application to resize it to a smaller size. In the case of WebKit, this would require the ability to execute JavaScript and control WebKit API calls related to `FastBitVector` or a data structure using it.
- The attacker needs to have access to a function which uses `FastBitVector` and is vulnerable to size miscalculation leading to the described memcpy issue.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided text mentions that `FastBitVector` is not referenced by many functions in WebKit, but the text describes one example in `JavaScriptCore/bytecode/BytecodeLivenessAnalysisInlines.h` where the `resize` is properly used, and another in `WTF/wtf/FastBitVector.h`, where a `misuse` of the `resizeSlow` could occur.
- The description highlights that the `FastBitVectorWordOwner::resize` function could be misunderstood and dangerous.
- It was reported that NVD might have overated its impact.
