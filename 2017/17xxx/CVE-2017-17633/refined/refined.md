Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17633

**Vulnerable Software:** Multiplex Movie Theater Booking Script 3.1.5

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `moid` and `eid` parameters used in `trailer-detail.php`, `show-time.php`, and `event-detail.php` scripts. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other potentially confidential information (e.g., `ticket_admin` table details).
- **Potential Data Modification:** Although not explicitly stated, successful SQL injection can also allow an attacker to modify or delete data, leading to data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests to the following scripts, by manipulating the `moid` and `eid` parameters:
    - `trailer-detail.php?moid=[SQL]`
    - `show-time.php?moid=[SQL]`
    - `event-detail.php?eid=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a fundamental understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit examples demonstrate the use of `UNION SELECT` statements to inject SQL queries.
- The examples use techniques to extract database information by manipulating the `moid` and `eid` parameters to query system tables like `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, as well as specific application tables like `ticket_admin`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit examples target MySQL databases.
- The exploit details provide proof-of-concept code.
