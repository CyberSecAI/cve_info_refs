  "CVE-2017-17637": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'val' parameter of the `countrycode1.php` script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or complete compromise of the application and its underlying database server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The application's `countrycode1.php` script receives a `val` parameter via HTTP GET request, which is then used in an unsanitized way in a SQL query."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application, which can be done remotely. No authentication is mentioned as a pre-requisite, implying no prior access is needed."
