{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user input when processing search queries, leading to stored XSS. Additionally, there is a lack of CSRF protection on the search functionality and user panel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers (XSS). They can also perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user by leveraging CSRF to modify user data or trigger XSS payloads.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted POST request to the search endpoint with malicious JavaScript in the 'phps_query' parameter (XSS).",
      "Tricking a logged-in user into submitting a form that performs a malicious action (CSRF)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload and send a POST request to the vulnerable search endpoint or prepare a malicious HTML page with a form targeting the vulnerable application for CSRF attacks. For XSS, the attacker can store the payload through the POST request and it will trigger when a user visits the search page. For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to trigger the malicious form, possibly through a link in a phishing email or malicious website."
