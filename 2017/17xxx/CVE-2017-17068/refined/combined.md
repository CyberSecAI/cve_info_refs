# AppCheck Discovers Vulnerability in Auth0 Library (CVE-2017-17068)

AppCheck discovered a security flaw within the auth0.js JavaScript library that could be exploited by a malicious website to read sensitive access tokens cross-domain.

AppCheck discovered a security flaw within the auth0.js JavaScript library that could be exploited by a malicious website to read sensitive access tokens cross-domain.

### About Auth0

Auth0 provides authentication solutions for a variety of platforms including the ability to integrate social media authentication into an application.

**“We solve the most complex identity use cases with an extensible and easy to integrate platform that secures billions of logins every month” – https://auth0.com/**

###

###

### Token Disclosure Vulnerability

AppCheck identified a security flaw within the Social Media authentication flow employed by the auth0.js client library. In brief, the following authentication flow is followed when authenticating via Facebook or Google using auth0.js :

* User selects to authenticate via Facebook and triggers a pop-up window to the Facebook login flow.
* The Facebook OAuth authentication process is completed and an access token is generated.
* The pop-up window passes the access token back to the requesting site using HTML5 postMessage. This token is then used to authenticate the user.

A vulnerability occurs since the origin and target of postMessage events between the pop-up window and the requesting page are not validated. i.e. Message event handlers will process messages from, and reply to, any website that submits the event. It is therefore possible for a malicious web page to open a pop-up for an authenticated user and intercept the sensitive access token. The attacker could use the token to then carry out actions on behalf of the user or read sensitive user information.

###

###

###

### Detecting the Vulnerability

AppCheck was able to detect this security flaw without any specific updates, reporting the vulnerability as “HTML5 postMessage information disclosure”. However, a specific plugin has been added to properly categorise the vulnerability to aid in remediation:

###

###

###

###

### Resolving the Vulnerability

Developers using the auth0.js library need to upgrade to the latest version: `8.12`.

Further details can be found on the vendors official website:

<https://auth0.com/docs/security/bulletins/cve-2017-17068>

###

### Proof of Concept

The following Proof of Concept JavaScript can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability. The auth\_url variable should be populated with the pop-up URL used in the target authentication flow

<script> function request\_token(event){ // when message is recieved send request back a request for the access\_token data = JSON.parse(event.data) if (data.a ==”ready”){ window.poc.postMessage(‘{“a”:”request”}’, ‘\*’); }else{ alert(JSON.stringify(data)); } } function popup(){ var auth\_url = “https://<target URL>/authorize?client\_id=<client\_id>&response\_type=token&connection=facebook….” window.poc = window.open(auth\_url); } window.addEventListener(“message”, request\_token) </script>

# CVE-2017-17068: Security Update for auth0.js Popup Callback Vulnerability

**Published**: December 4, 2017

**CVE number**: CVE-2017-17068

**Credit**: [@AppCheckNG](https://twitter.com/AppCheckNG)

## Overview

A vulnerability has been identified in the [auth0.js JavaScript library](/docs/libraries/auth0js), affecting versions < `8.12`.

If your site or application uses a popup callback page with `auth0.popup.callback()` then an attacker can take advantage of unrestricted cross-origin post message requests and gain access to the tokens of logged-in users. A malicious website could then use any acquired Access Tokens to invoke services on behalf of the user.

This update addresses the vulnerability by implementing origin verification so the message cannot be posted to a page that is not in a specified domain. If no domain is specified, only the domain where the callback page is hosted is allowed. An attacker would receive a cross-origin request error.

Patching this vulnerability requires a library upgrade.

## Am I affected?

If the following apply you are affected by this vulnerability:

* You use a version of auth0.js lower than `8.12`
* You use a popup callback page with `auth0.popup.callback()` in your code

## How to fix that?

Developers using the auth0.js library need to upgrade to the latest version: `8.12`.

Updated packages are available on npm. To ensure delivery of additional bug fixes moving forward, please make sure your `package.json` file is updated to take patch and minor level updates of our libraries.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "auth0-js": "^8.12.0"
  }
}
```

Yes /No
### Will this update impact my users?

No. This fix patches the library that your application runs, but will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.
