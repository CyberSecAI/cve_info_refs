Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-17068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of `postMessage` events within the `auth0.js` JavaScript library during social media authentication flows (Facebook, Google). Specifically, the origin and target of these events between a popup window and the requesting page are not validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Origin Validation:** The `auth0.js` library does not verify the origin of `postMessage` events. This allows any website, not just the intended one, to receive and process the access token sent via `postMessage`.
*   **Cross-Origin Information Disclosure:** This lack of validation enables a malicious website to intercept sensitive access tokens intended for the legitimate application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access Token Theft:** An attacker can steal access tokens from authenticated users.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The stolen access token can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as invoking services or accessing sensitive user information, without the user's consent.
*   **Account Hijacking (potential):** If the access token allows for sufficient permissions, an attacker could potentially gain full control over a user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a malicious web page.
*   **Pop-up Window:** The malicious page opens a pop-up window to initiate an authentication flow with the vulnerable application.
*   **Message Interception:** The malicious page intercepts the access token sent via `postMessage` from the pop-up.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website.
*   The attacker must be able to induce a user to visit this malicious website while the user is authenticated with an application using the vulnerable `auth0.js` library.
*   The attacker does not need any specific knowledge or access to the user's application or account beyond what is exposed during the normal authentication flow.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `auth0.js` versions prior to `8.12`.
*   The vulnerability is present when using a popup callback page with `auth0.popup.callback()`.
*   The fix involves implementing origin verification in `auth0.js` to ensure that `postMessage` requests are only processed if they originate from a specified domain.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by AppCheck, a security company.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) JavaScript code is provided that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
