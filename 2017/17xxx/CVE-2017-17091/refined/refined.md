Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-17091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `newbloguser` key, used when adding a new user in WordPress, was generated using a predictable method (`substr(md5($user_id), 0, 5)`), specifically a substring of the MD5 hash of the user ID. This made the key easily guessable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Key Generation:** The vulnerability stemmed from the use of a predictable method to generate the `newbloguser` key. Instead of generating a secure random key, a simple substring of an MD5 hash of the user ID was used.
- **Bypass of Access Restrictions**: Attackers could bypass intended access restrictions by knowing or guessing the key for a particular user, which was easily derived from the user ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing User Creation Restrictions:** Attackers could bypass the intended access control restrictions related to new user creation by crafting a request with the predictable `newbloguser` key, leading to unauthorized user creation.
- While the impact is limited to the new user creation process, this can be a stepping stone for further compromise if the new user is given elevated privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability could be exploited over the network by sending a request to the WordPress server with the predictable `newbloguser` key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of User ID:** The attacker needed to know or guess the user ID of the intended user they wanted to create.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needed network access to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented in WordPress 4.9.1 replaced the predictable key generation method with `wp_generate_password(20, false)`, which creates a more secure, random password.
- This vulnerability is part of a set of four security issues addressed in WordPress 4.9.1.
- Debian also released security updates to address this issue in their packaged versions of WordPress.
