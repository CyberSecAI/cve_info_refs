Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `findcity.php` script of the Single Theater Booking Script version 3.2.1. Specifically, the `q` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input in an SQL query without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database by crafting SQL queries.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  An attacker might modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker may gain the ability to execute code on the database server or the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is the `q` parameter within the `findcity.php` script via a GET request, as demonstrated in the exploit example:
    `http://localhost/[PATH]/findcity.php?q=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `q` parameter in `findcity.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection and must be able to craft a malicious SQL query.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided exploit code includes a blind SQL injection payload that attempts to extract database information using `UNION` and `export_set`.
