```
{
  "CVE-2017-17405": {
    "root_cause": "The `Net::FTP` module in Ruby uses `Kernel#open` to open a local file. When the `localfile` argument starts with a pipe character (`|`), the command following the pipe character is executed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the system where the Ruby application is running, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious FTP server can manipulate the `remotefile` string (used as default `localfile`) to include a pipe character followed by a command. When a client downloads the file using the vulnerable `Net::FTP` methods (such as `get`, `getbinaryfile`, `gettextfile`, `put`, `putbinaryfile`, and `puttextfile`), the command is executed by the ruby interpreter.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must control a malicious FTP server or have the ability to manipulate file names on a legitimate FTP server. The client application must use the vulnerable methods in `Net::FTP` and not provide their own `localfile` argument, relying instead on the default value of `File.basename(remotefile)`."
