The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in a "Bus Booking Script", including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input sanitization in `view_seatseller.php` and `view_member.php`.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as database users and versions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `sp_id` and `memid` parameters in the URLs.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests with crafted parameters.
*   **Technical Details:** The provided URLs show how to exploit the SQL injection using `and length(version())<12--+-` and `order by 28--+-` to extract database information.

**XSS (Reflected & Stored):**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient output encoding or sanitization.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Reflected XSS and Stored XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.
*   **Attack Vector (Reflected XSS):** The `datepicker` parameter in `results.php` is vulnerable to XSS by injecting malicious script.
*   **Attack Vector (Stored XSS):** The `spemail` parameter in `new_master.php` is vulnerable to stored XSS.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests with malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Technical Details:** Reflected XSS is demonstrated by injecting `<img src=x onerror="console.log(document.cookie)">`. Stored XSS is shown by injecting  `'"><img src=x onerror=alert(123)><'"` in the `spemail` parameter.

**CSRF:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in `new_master.php`.
*   **Vulnerability:** CSRF.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform actions they didn't intend to, such as adding malicious XSS code through the admin panel.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious HTML page with a form that submits to the vulnerable `new_master.php` endpoint with malicious XSS code.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage and trick a logged-in admin user into visiting it.
*   **Technical Details:** The provided proof-of-concept HTML demonstrates how to craft a CSRF attack that injects a stored XSS payload.

The document provides proof-of-concept URLs and HTML code demonstrating each vulnerability type, which goes beyond the standard CVE description.
