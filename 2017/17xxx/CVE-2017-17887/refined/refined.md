Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is related to the handling of malformed MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics) image files within the `ReadOneMNGImage` function in ImageMagick's PNG coder (`coders/png.c`).
- Specifically, the issue appears to be due to improper memory management when processing such malformed files, leading to memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leaks:** The primary vulnerability is memory leaks when processing malformed MNG images. The provided leak sanitizer output indicates direct and indirect leaks of memory allocated during image processing.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The memory leaks can lead to a "cache resources exhausted" error, indicating that the application consumes all available memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a specially crafted MNG image, an attacker can trigger memory leaks and cause the ImageMagick process to consume excessive resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.
- **Possible Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided content, the Ubuntu Security Notice mentions "possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program", indicating the potential for more severe impact, though the provided details focus on DoS through memory leaks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted MNG image file.
- **User/Automated System Interaction:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a user or automated system uses ImageMagick to open/process the crafted image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed MNG file to a system running ImageMagick.
- **Target System Access:** The attacker does not need direct system access, rather the ability to induce a user or automated process to process the malicious image.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Github issue includes a test case (malicious MNG file) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3681-1) lists CVE-2017-17887 along with other CVEs, indicating multiple vulnerabilities were fixed at the same time for ImageMagick. This is not an exhaustive analysis of all vulnerabilities listed but specifically focuses on the memory leak issue described by the github issue and the ubuntu security notice.
- The issue is specifically in the `ReadOneMNGImage` function within ImageMagick's PNG coder (`coders/png.c`).
- The leak sanitizer output shows that memory is allocated using `malloc` and `posix_memalign` via `AcquireMagickMemory`, `AcquireQuantumMemory`, and `AcquireSemaphoreMemory` calls. This is further detailed in the call stack traces of the provided memory leak output.
