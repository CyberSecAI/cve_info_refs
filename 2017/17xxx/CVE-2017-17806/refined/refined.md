Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-17806 from the provided documents:

**CVE-2017-17806:** This CVE is about a vulnerability in the HMAC implementation within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the implementation failed to validate whether the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm is unkeyed. A local attacker could exploit this by using the AF_ALG-based hash interface and the SHA-3 hash algorithm to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow by crafting specific system calls that lack proper SHA-3 initialization.

Here's a consolidation of vulnerability details from the provided content, organized for clarity:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The HMAC implementation in the Linux kernel (specifically `crypto/hmac.c`) did not check if the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm is unkeyed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Validation**: The HMAC implementation lacks a proper validation step to ensure that underlying hash algorithms are unkeyed, as required for HMAC construction.
*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  A crafted sequence of system calls using the AF\_ALG hash interface and the SHA-3 hash algorithm can result in a stack buffer overflow due to a missing SHA-3 initialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack buffer overflow can lead to a system crash, causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** Some descriptions suggest that exploitation could also lead to the execution of arbitrary code. This aspect is not consistent across all sources.
*   **Information Leak (Implied):** Although not explicitly stated, a buffer overflow often could lead to some sort of information disclosure if the overflow can be controlled.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local user access on the system.
*   **Specific Interfaces:** Attack vector involves the use of the AF\_ALG-based hash interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_HASH) and specifically targets the SHA-3 hash algorithm (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_SHA3).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** Attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Low Privileges Required** Generally, Low privileges are required according to the extracted sources.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require user interaction.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of a check on the underlying hash algorithm within the HMAC code.
*   The SHA-3 algorithm, when improperly initialized (missing `sha3_init()`), can cause a stack buffer overflow during hash calculation.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted sequence of system calls interacts with the AF\_ALG hash interface and the SHA-3 hashing routine.

**Additional details:**

*  SUSE information lists several Bugzilla entries related to this CVE and its fixes, as well as multiple SUSE Security Advisories associated with this CVE.
*   Ubuntu indicates the vulnerability can potentially lead to DoS (system crash) or arbitrary code execution, affecting various Ubuntu releases (including 14.04, 16.04, 17.10), and their respective kernels, along with their fixes.
*   openSUSE lists fixed package versions for their Leap 42.2 and 15.0 and Tumbleweed distributions.
*   The git.kernel.org content shows the commit addressing the issue directly at the source code level, specifically in `crypto/hmac.c` and how it now handles underlying hash algorithm using function `crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()`. The commit message provides details on how the flaw was triggered and what was changed to address it.
* Red Hat identifies that affected products are Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9 LE, RHSA-2018:2948 addresses this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2017-17806 is a local privilege escalation and denial of service vulnerability caused by inadequate validation of hash algorithm types in the HMAC implementation of the Linux kernel. It is exploitable by crafting specific sequences of system calls using the AF\_ALG interface with SHA-3 algorithm.

The information extracted here provides a more granular view than what is typically found in the standard CVE description, especially with the context of how it affects specific distros like SUSE, Ubuntu, and RedHat and how the fixes were addressed.
