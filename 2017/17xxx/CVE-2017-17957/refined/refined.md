The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in a PHP Multivendor Ecommerce application, but none of them relate to the specified CVE-2017-17957.

The vulnerabilities described are:

1.  **Reflected XSS**: Multiple instances of reflected XSS are present in `category.php`, `seller-view.php`, `shopping-cart.php`, and `my_wishlist.php` due to unsanitized URL parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-controlled input in URL parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript are sent to victims.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker can craft malicious URLs and trick the user into accessing them.

2.  **Stored XSS:** A stored XSS vulnerability exists in `admin/sellerupd.php` through the `companyname` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate sanitization of POST data.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious JavaScript is stored and executed when an administrator views the compromised data. This can lead to account compromise, data manipulation, and wider spread of attacks against the admin panel.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted POST request with malicious JavaScript.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Authenticated admin access to the `admin/sellerupd.php` page or ability to perform CSRF attack.

3.  **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are found in `seller-view.php`, `shopping-cart.php`, and `my_wishlist.php` by manipulating the `usid`, `cusid`, and `fid` parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper sanitization of user input before constructing SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain unauthorized access to the server.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs with malicious SQL queries in URL parameters.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker can craft malicious URLs.

4.  **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, specifically against the `admin/sellerupd.php` page, allowing attackers to change sensitive user settings.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions can be performed on behalf of a logged-in user. This can lead to modification of user settings, account takeover or injection of stored-XSS payloads.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious web page crafted by the attacker forces the victim's browser to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious website.

5.  **Arbitrary Binding:** The email verification process for new accounts uses predictable URLs, allowing an attacker to bind an account to any email address.
    *   **Weakness:** Predictable email verification URL with sequential IDs.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can create accounts linked to any email address, potentially leading to impersonation, spamming or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Brute forcing or predicting the activation URL for a given user ID and binding the account to an attacker-controlled email address.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker can predict the verification URLs.

**Therefore, the provided content is UNRELATED to CVE-2017-17957.**
