The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in a "Single Theater Booking" application. These include:

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Vulnerability:** The `theatreid` parameter in `viewtheatre.php` is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
   - **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript is sent to the victim. When the victim clicks the link, the script is executed in their browser.
   - **Example URL:**
     ```
     http://www.theaterbookingscript.com/demo/theater-booking/single-theater/admin/viewtheatre.php?theatreid=29%27%22%3Etest%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=console.log(%27xss2%27)%3Etest%3C%27%22test
     ```
   - **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
   - **Attacker Capability:** Needs to craft a malicious URL and trick the user into accessing it.

**2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Vulnerability:** The `title` parameter in `sitesettings.php` is vulnerable to stored XSS.
   - **Attack Vector:** A POST request with a malicious JavaScript payload is submitted to the vulnerable endpoint. This payload is then stored and executed when other users access this data.
   - **Example POST Data:**
      ```
      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

      Ticket Booking'"><svg/onload=alert('xss')><'"
      ```
   - **Impact:** An attacker could permanently inject malicious JavaScript into the application, which could then be executed in the browsers of other users, leading to the same consequences as reflected XSS.
   - **Attacker Capability:** Needs to be able to submit a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, which can likely be done by any authenticated admin.

**3. SQL Injection**
   - **Vulnerability:** The `movieid` parameter in `movieview.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
   - **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious SQL code is sent to the server, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
   - **Example URL:**
      ```
      http://www.theaterbookingscript.com/demo/theater-booking/single-theater/admin/movieview.php?movieid=56
      ```
   - **Impact:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete data from the database, or even execute commands on the underlying server. The content specifically mentions obtaining "current data user or more sensitive data".
   - **Attacker Capability:** Needs to craft a malicious URL, and needs to be able to access the admin panel.

**4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - **Vulnerability:** The `sitesettings.php` endpoint is vulnerable to CSRF.
   - **Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a malicious webpage that submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint when a victim visits the page while logged into the application.
   - **Example HTML (PoC) provided in the content:** This HTML form is designed to submit changes to the site settings on the vulnerable application without the user's knowledge.
   - **Impact:** An attacker could manipulate sensitive settings, including the `title` parameter, allowing them to inject stored XSS.
   - **Attacker Capability:**  Needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page and trick a user logged into the application into visiting it.
