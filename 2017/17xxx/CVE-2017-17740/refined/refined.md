  "CVE-2017-17740": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when both the nops module and the memberof overlay are enabled in OpenLDAP. During a member MODDN (modify distinguished name) operation, the nops module attempts to free a buffer that was allocated on the stack by the memberof overlay.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer handling",
        "Incorrect memory management in the interaction between 'nops' module and 'memberof' overlay."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service by causing a slapd crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access",
        "Sending a specifically crafted MODDN request."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to perform MODDN operations on the LDAP server. They do not need specific privileges as the vulnerability is triggered by simply sending a malformed request to the server."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "OpenLDAP 2.4.45 and earlier",
	    "nops module",
      "memberof overlay"
    ],
	"additional_information": "This issue is related to how OpenLDAP handles memory management when using the nops module with the memberof overlay. The 'nops' module attempts to free a buffer that is allocated on the stack by the 'memberof' module which causes a crash. Patches were provided that corrected the original issue but also introduced a new memory error which was then corrected. The issue was marked as resolved in various SUSE and openSUSE products, with the nops module being disabled in some cases. The upstream project has not been supporting the nops module, as it's a contrib module. This CVE also includes details from various SUSE bugzilla entries, openSUSE mailing list posts, and the original OpenLDAP issue tracker. It's noted that the nops module is not part of the base OpenLDAP installation in some environments."
