The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in a "Paid To Read Script" application, which includes sensitive information leaks, unauthorized access, XSS, and SQL Injection.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Leak:** The application reveals the absolute file path when provided with invalid parameters, which occurs due to improper error handling or insufficient input sanitization.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The application allows access to admin pages and sensitive user data without proper authentication checks, due to missing or inadequate authorization controls.
*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the web page leading to reflected XSS.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input used in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leak:** Exposes the server's absolute file paths.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Allows unauthenticated access to admin panels and sensitive user information.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows manipulation of SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the server's file structure, which could aid further attacks.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain administrative privileges and access to user data, enabling them to manipulate the application or steal sensitive information.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface web pages.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can extract, modify, or delete data from the database, potentially causing significant damage or data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Information Leak:** Sending crafted requests with invalid parameter values.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Directly accessing admin pages with specific parameters via the URL.
*   **XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript through URL parameters.
*   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code through URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker needs to know how to send HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** For SQL injection, the attacker needs to understand basic SQL syntax.
