- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used to construct SQL queries within the handling of GET method requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability in the `NVBUEventHistory Get Method`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted GET method requests to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the service, no authentication is required.
