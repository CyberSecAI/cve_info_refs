- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SIP module fails to properly parse malformed SIP messages when validating variables, leading to an overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the SIP module's inability to handle malformed SIP messages during variable validation, resulting in an overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a process of the SIP module to reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a malformed SIP message over the network to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the targeted device and be able to send SIP messages.
