## Description

**True two-way group communication over email**

[WP Mailster](https://wpmailster.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=WPMST&utm_content=plugin+repo+description) allows your users to be part of a group and communicate by email without having to log into a website.

Similar to programs like Mailman or Listserv this plugin allows you to run a discussion mailing list.

That means that every email sent to a central email address is forwarded to the rest of the members of the list.

When members reply to such list emails WP Mailster again forwards them to the other list recipients.

Unlike newsletter plugins this allows true two-way communication via email.

### Features

* group communication through email
* usable with any POP3/IMAP email account
* recipients can be managed in the WordPress admin area
* users can subscribe/unsubscribe through widgets on the website
* all WP users can be chosen as recipients, additional recipients can be stored (without having to create them as WP users)
* users can be organized in groups
* single users or whole groups can be added as recipients of a mailing list
* replies to mailing list messages can be forwarded to all recipients (or only the sender)
* email archive for browsing the mails
* full support of HTML emails and attachments
* custom headers and footers
* subject prefixes
* many [more features](https://wpmailster.com/feature-comparison/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=WPMST&utm_content=plugin+repo+description)

> **Note**: This version of WP Mailster is FREE and limited in terms of number of lists and subscribers per list. Additional features such as captcha protection, double opt-in, email filtering, configurable event notifications, and many others are available in the **[premium editions](https://wpmailster.com/pricing/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=WPMST&utm_content=plugin+repo+description)**.

## FAQ

### How do I send an email?

When you want to use WP Mailster you don’t need to browse to a website, login and do something to send the message there – you just use your favorite mail client.

Simply write an email to the mailing list’s address – and nothing else. So use Gmail, Outlook, Thunderbird, a Webmailer, any way you like – just send it to the mailing list address you have setup in WP Mailster.

### Why take the emails so long to be delivered? How can I speed up sending?

WP Mailster is a part of WordPress which is a PHP based web application. That means: it can not act/run without being triggered and it can not run forever when triggered. This is a technical limitation coming from PHP, not from WP Mailster or WordPress.

Triggering means that somebody accesses the site. During the page load WP Mailster is handling the jobs to do (mail retrieving/sending). Thus mails can only be send/retrieved when somebody is browsing your site, otherwise the delivery is delayed or never done. As your site might not be browsed every few minutes 24×7 we recommend you to use a cronjob that opens the site periodically. We have a guide on our website on how to set that up.

### What are send errors?

The send errors are messages your email server is giving back to WP Mailster basically saying “I will not forward this message”. Then WP Mailster sending for some time but eventually stops which is what you see happening.

The cause can be a lot of things, e.g. hitting send limits (per hour/day) or sending email with content that the server does not like.

You need to find out what your email servers are telling WP Mailster. Please follow our troubleshooting guide on our site.

### Why do I get a “Certificate failure” error message upon checking the inbox connection?

You might get an error message like this when checking the connection settings: “Certificate failure for [server] Server name does not match certificate” or “Certificate failure for [server] unable to get local issuer certificate”.

This is often the case when you use your own mailing server (with a self-signed certificate). To get a connection established, you need to deactivate the automated certificate check. Do this by adding the following line in the special parameter box: **/novalidate-cert**

### What does the message “Problem identified: PHP IMAP extension not installed” mean?

Your server needs the PHP IMAP extension installed, otherwise WP Mailster can not work at all. There is nothing that we can do about that, you need to contact your webhoster and see whether they can enable/install the PHP IMAP extension.

If that is not possible you need to use a different webhoster providing a more suitable environment.

Please note that it does not matter whether you want to use IMAP or POP3 for accessing the mailing list inbox. You need the extension in both cases, it is not specific to the IMAP protocol.

### Why do I get “Connection refused” or “Network is unreachable” messages, although I use the correct mailbox settings?

In most situations this connection errors show up when your webhoster (where WordPress/WP Mailster is installed) is blocking outgoing connections such as connection attempts to 3rd party email servers. This is done to avoid spam sending.

Please contact your webhoster, so they configure their firewall to allow you to send emails.

### Why does my website show this error “Fatal error: Out of memory (allocated […]) (tried to allocate […] bytes) in […]/wp-content/plugins/wp-mailster/[…]”

Your issue is very likely coming from a large email causing an PHP out of memory error. This is resulting from the fact that every PHP environment has a memory limit. This limit is hit when the email is tried to be retrieved from the mail server.

Please remove this email from the mailing list in question. Either through a mail webfrontend or with the “Delete first email in inbox” tool the “Tools” section in the mailing list’s settings.

In order to prevent have this happen in the future:

* Raise the PHP memory limit. Your webhoster can help you with that.
* Introduce a maximum email size for WP Mailster. You can find this setting in the “List behaviour” tab of the mailing lists settings. If larger emails are in the inbox, WP Mailster will not try to process them but simply delete it and tell the sender what happened.

### What is the difference between a Mailing List and a Group?

A **mailing list** is a set of recipients that should all get the messages send to the mailing list’s email address.

A **group** is a way of organizing users. Think of it like a bucket of users. It comes in handy if you want certain users be recipients of multiple mailing lists. Then you would not add the users directly to the recipients of a mailing list, but rather add a group.

An example would be that you have three groups: Management, Project Coordinators and Developers.

If you want to run a company-wide mailing list (e.g. all@example.com) and a project mailing list (e.g. project.import@example.com) then you would add

* all three groups (Management, Project Coordinators and Developers) as recipients of the company-wide mailing list
* only the Project Coordinators and Developers groups as recipients of the project mailing list

Why all that?

In case someone joins the project team you would only add the user to the Developers group. Then the user would be automatically be a recipient of both the project and the company-wide mailing list.

The same thing applies if someone leaves: the user only needs to be removed form the groups and thus is automatically removed from the mailing lists that have this groups as the recipients.

So to sum up: if you run many lists and have many users that are largely managed by the admin, then it might be handy to organize users in groups and add the groups as the recipients.

### How can I report security bugs?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wp-mailster)

I’ve been using this plugin for about 3 years now, and it’s been working a charm. Simple and effective. Then I recently ran into a little problem. The developer responded very quickly, and I was able to resolve the issue right away.

Holger was brilliant in helping me sort an issue with blank emails. He sent me an amended version of the plugin which solved the issue. Great communication and so helpful, even though we use the free version! The plugin is full of features not available in other WordPress mailing list plugins, and the even the free version gives us all the functionality we want.
Thank you, Holger!

I’ve been using Mailster for many years, first in Joomla and now in Wordpress. The most important thing for me is that the editors use their regular WordPress login to manage the mailing lists. And it just works.

I have been using this plugin for a longer period on different sites and I am very happy with its possibilities and its versatility.
Recently, I had a problem which was related with the new EU legislation when it comes to using a from address different from the mail list address.
Although I am using just the free version (as of today…), I was supported in a superb manner with fast and helpful suggestions. At the end, those suggestions were correct and the problem was solved with some effort provided by the plugin author!
I can absolutely recommend this plugin not only or its functionality, but also for the service being provided: you are definitely not alone!
Thanks for that and kindest regards!
Michael

This plugin is the best alternative one can find when “migrating” from tools like Mailman. Support is provided directly by the dev and excellent. I can clearly recommend this plugin over all the other options out there! Thank You.
