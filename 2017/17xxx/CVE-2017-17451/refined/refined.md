The provided content is related to the WordPress plugin "WP Mailster" and includes a changelog that mentions several security fixes, including a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability addressed in version 1.8.21. However, the content does not provide a CVE description.

Based on the changelog information:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability:** Fixed in version 1.8.21 and also mentioned in prior versions. This indicates that user-supplied data was not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically mentioned as fixed in version 1.8.18.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Fixed in version 1.8.17, requires Contributor role or higher.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Fixed in versions 1.8.17 and 1.8.18, some require Subscriber role or higher. Also existed in the context of CSV exports.
*  **Settings change vulnerabilities**: Fixed in 1.8.17
*  **Arbitrary Content Deletion**: Fixed in 1.8.17

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the XSS vulnerability is likely due to the plugin not properly sanitizing user inputs and displaying them on the website, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts. The SQL Injection vulnerabilities stem from unsanitized user input in database queries. Sensitive data exposure issues are likely caused by insufficient access control or insecure handling of data in CSV exports.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or phishing attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive database information or modify the data.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data of users.
*   **Arbitrary Content Deletion:** An attacker could delete content from the website.
*   **Settings change vulnerabilities:** An attacker could change plugin settings to compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** The attack vector for XSS involves injecting malicious scripts through user inputs.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector for SQL injection is through crafting malicious SQL queries in user input fields.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Attackers may exploit vulnerable CSV export mechanisms or other endpoints.
*   **Settings change vulnerabilities**: Attackers might exploit user input fields to inject malicious code into settings parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For XSS, the attacker may need to be able to inject content in the website (e.g. through vulnerable forms or other user input areas). Some XSS attacks may require a Contributor role or higher.
*   For SQL Injection, the attacker requires a Contributor role or higher.
*   For some Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerabilities, a Subscriber role or higher is needed while others require access to CSV exports.
*   For settings change and arbitrary content deletion vulnerabilities, a Contributor or higher role was needed.
