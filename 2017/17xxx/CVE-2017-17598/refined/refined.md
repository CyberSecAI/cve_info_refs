Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17598:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `product-category.php` file, specifically in the `key` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically boolean-based blind SQL injection, where the attacker can infer information based on the true/false results of injected SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject SQL commands, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Access sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control over the database server, depending on the database privileges and the specific SQL injection used.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `product-category.php` file.
*   The attacker manipulates the `key` parameter, embedding SQL injection payloads within the request.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable parameter is `http://localhost/[PATH]/product-category.php?key=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication or specific user privileges are mentioned as being required for successful exploitation.
*   The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `product-category.php` file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in "Affiliate MLM Script 1.0".
*   The provided proof-of-concept payload is `key=a%' AND 5436=5436 AND '%'='` to test for boolean-based blind SQLi.
*   The application is a PHP-based web application.
