- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper memory management when handling malformed MPLS Service PING messages. Specifically, the affected products fail to release allocated memory when processing these packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak, which can ultimately cause a denial of service by exhausting available memory and impacting the product's availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers send specifically crafted, malformed MPLS Service PING messages to the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    1. The attacker needs to gain access to the product's network.
    2. The targeted device interface must have MPLS enabled.
