Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-17123:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference within the `coff_slurp_reloc_table` function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library of Binutils. The function attempts to access a symbol pointer (`cache_ptr->sym_ptr_ptr`) without ensuring that it is not NULL. This occurs when processing a malformed PE (Portable Executable) file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code does not validate the `sym_ptr_ptr` before dereferencing it which can lead to a crash.
- Incorrect assumption: The code assumes that a symbol is always available during reloc processing when this may not be the case.
- Missing null checks: The initial fix only addressed the issue in the `coff_slurp_reloc_table` function. The underlying cause was that the calling function `bfd_canonicalize_reloc` was receiving a NULL for symbols, indicating more places were missing checks for NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and crashes the program. Specifically, the `objdump` utility crashes when trying to process the malformed PE file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious file: The attacker crafts a malformed PE file that, when processed by `objdump`, triggers the null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed PE file to a user or system that is using the vulnerable version of binutils, specifically `objdump`. The user or system must then attempt to process the file using `objdump`, which will trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was initially triggered with the `objdump -W $POC` command and was found on an Ubuntu 16.04 system.
- The bug report also includes a GDB backtrace showing the location of the crash and an ASAN output.
- The initial fix addressed the null check in `coff_slurp_reloc_table`, while subsequent fixes addressed more targets and the underlying issue with the symbols pointer being NULL.
- The fix involved checking for a NULL symbol pointer before attempting to use it during reloc processing and additionally passing `syms` to `bfd_canonicalize_reloc`.
