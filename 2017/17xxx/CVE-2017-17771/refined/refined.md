{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A missing bounds check in the camera driver",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An out-of-bounds write due to missing bounds check, leading to potential elevation of privilege.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of privilege. An attacker could potentially gain higher privileges on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the camera driver.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the camera driver, likely through a malicious application or process with access to camera functionality. "
