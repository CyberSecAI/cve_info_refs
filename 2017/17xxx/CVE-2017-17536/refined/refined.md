```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Mercurial (hg) command-line binary treats the flags `--config=...` and `--debugger` specially, evaluating them as flags regardless of their position in the command. This behavior differs from standard command-line argument parsing, allowing these flags to be interpreted even when they are embedded within other arguments (e.g., branch names, file names).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability in Phabricator due to the unusual parsing behavior of Mercurial's `--config` and `--debugger` flags.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Phabricator server by crafting specific branch or file names containing the vulnerable flags.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by browsing a specially crafted branch or file name within a Mercurial repository. When Phabricator fetches information about this branch or file using `hg`, the injected `--config` or `--debugger` flags are executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to browse Mercurial repositories in Diffusion on the vulnerable Phabricator server."
