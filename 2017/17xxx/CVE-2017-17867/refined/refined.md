  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that an authenticated user can modify `odhcpd`'s configuration, specifically the `leasetrigger` parameter, to point to any executable file. This file gets executed as root whenever a new DHCP lease is granted.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure default configuration allowing modification of the `leasetrigger` parameter.",
        "Lack of input sanitization on the `leasetrigger` parameter.",
        "Execution of the specified `leasetrigger` as root.",
        "The Samba share feature allows writing files to the /mnt directory, which is not protected by the noexec flag allowing arbitrary script execution."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution as root. An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts or binaries on the router, leading to full control of the device.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker authenticates to the router's web interface (usually with the default 'user' password, which is also the WiFi key). After successful login, the attacker can send JSON-formatted commands through the WebSocket interface, leveraging the vulnerable `leasetrigger` setting. By using the Samba share, the attacker can upload an arbitrary script to /mnt and then set the leasetrigger to execute the script after a reboot. The script will be executed as root.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have network access to the router and know the password for the `user` account (which is often the same as the WiFi password). No prior knowledge of other vulnerabilities is required to exploit this. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device."
