The provided content is related to CVE-2017-17155.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability due to non-compliance with the 4-byte alignment requirement imposed by the MIPS CPU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access
- Insufficient input validation resulting in data not being properly aligned for the MIPS processor

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause unauthorized memory access, which may lead to system exceptions.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to have network access to the affected device and be able to craft special IKEv2 packets to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the affected device
- Ability to craft special IKEv2 packets
