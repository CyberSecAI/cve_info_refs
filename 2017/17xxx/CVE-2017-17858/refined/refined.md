Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-17858:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple memory corruption issues found in Artifex MuPDF version 1.12.0. These issues include:
    *   Heap-based buffer overflow
    *   Invalid memory write
    *   Invalid memory read

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  Occurs in `ensure_solid_xref` function within `pdf-xref.c`.  Specifically, a write of 40 bytes occurs at a location immediately after a 40-byte region allocated earlier, leading to the overflow.
*   **Invalid memory write:** Occurs in `pdf_prime_xref_index` function within `pdf-xref.c`. This leads to a segmentation fault due to writing to an unknown address.
*   **Invalid memory read:** Occurs in `ensure_solid_xref` within `pdf-xref.c`. This causes a read from address 0, which results in a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerabilities can lead to a denial-of-service due to segmentation faults or memory corruption.
*   Potentially, a remote attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through malformed PDF files. An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file, and if a user opens this file with a vulnerable version of MuPDF, the vulnerabilities are triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a user with a malicious PDF file. They could achieve this by hosting the file on a website, sending it as an attachment via email, or any other means of file transfer.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided Github content includes ASAN logs that provide technical details on the location of the errors in `pdf-xref.c` for all three vulnerabilities.
*   The specific functions where the errors occur are:
    *  `pdf_prime_xref_index` for the invalid memory write.
    *  `ensure_solid_xref` for the heap-based buffer overflow and the invalid memory read.
*   The issues were fixed in commit `55c3f68d638ac1263a386e0aaa004bb6e8bde731`.
*   The reported issues were tracked in ghostscript bugzilla as bugs [698819](https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698819), [698820](https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698820), and [698821](https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698821). However, access is denied to those Bugzilla links.
*   The gentoo advisory mentions the affected package as `app-text/mupdf` with versions less than 1.13.0.
