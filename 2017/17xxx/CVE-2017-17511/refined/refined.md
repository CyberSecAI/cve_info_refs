      "Improper input validation",

   ],
   "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in how KildClient handles the BROWSER environment variable. The program does not properly sanitize the input from this variable before using it to open a URL, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands by injecting malicious arguments. The vulnerability exists in the `prefs.c` and `worldgui.c` files of the KildClient source code. The fix involves sanitizing the input before calling the system's browser."
