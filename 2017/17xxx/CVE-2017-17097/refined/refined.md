{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "The `writeLog` function in `fn_common.php` does not properly sanitize input, leading to PHP code injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote code injection",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system takeover if combined with another vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted requests through the application, such as the login form or password recovery mode.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP POST requests with malicious code in input fields. Note that the code injected must not contain quotes because of the mysql_real_escape_string() function"
  },
    "vulnerability_2": {
    "root_cause": "The password reset procedure immediately resets the password and sends a predictable, date-based password via email.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable password generation",
      "Unauthenticated password reset"
    ],
    "impact": "Admin account takeover.",
     "attack_vectors": "Password reset requests and predicting the generated password",
     "required_capabilities": "Ability to send unauthenticated password reset requests and execute a provided php script that attempts to predict the reset password. This attack is made harder because of captcha on the password reset form."
