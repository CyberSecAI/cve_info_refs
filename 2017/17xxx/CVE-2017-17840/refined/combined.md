Message-ID: <20171213192155.GA21805@localhost.localdomain>

Subject: Bugs in iscsiuio

Hi all,

We took a quick look at iscsiuio (from the iscsi-initiator-utils),
discovered several bugs, and sent a brief report of our findings to
linux-distros (on Monday, December 11). It was then decided that we
should send this report to oss-security on Wednesday, December 13:
please see below.

Notes: we did not have the time to draft a proper advisory, so this is
rather raw material, but hopefully it will be useful and detailed
enough; also, we did not fully investigate the exploitability (or
unexploitability) of these issues; and this was by no means an
exhaustive audit, so there may be more bugs to be found.

Thank you very much! With best regards,

-- the Qualys Security Advisory team

Source: iscsi-initiator-utils-6.2.0.874-6.git86e8892.fc27.src.rpm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In iscsid_loop(), new connections are accepted on the abstract socket
@ISCSID_UIP_ABSTRACT_NAMESPACE, but the source of the connection is not
checked: any local user can connect and send messages, thus triggering
the bugs below; this may or may not be the intended behavior. (iscsid
for example processes only root's messages, in mgmt_ipc_handle()).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In process_iscsid_broadcast(), payload_len is read directly from the
user's message, without checks, and then used in an fread() to a fixed-
size buffer: a straight heap overflow (arbitrary size, arbitrary bytes).
This would probably be exploitable, but every distribution we checked
compiles iscsiuio with FORTIFY, and __fread_chk() catches the heap
overflow before it happens, and aborts:

$ echo -e '\1\0\0\0\x41\x41\x41\x41' | socat - ABSTRACT-CONNECT:ISCSID_UIP_ABSTRACT_NAMESPACE

Process 32442 (iscsiuio) of user 0 dumped core.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In process_iscsid_broadcast(), rsp is not initialized, and the
ISCSID_UIP_IPC_GET_IFACE and default cases do not initialize its ping_sc
member: because rsp is then sent back to the connected user, this may
leak useful information to an attacker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of process_iscsid_broadcast() there is an fclose(fd) where fd
is fdopen(s2); but after the return, iscsid_loop() calls close(s2): this
double-closes s2, which may not always be a problem, but here, iscsiuio
is multi-threaded and it is theoretically possible that another thread
recycles the file descriptor s2 after the fclose(fd) but before the
close(s2), which would therefore close the wrong file.

Note: at the beginning of process_iscsid_broadcast() there is a return
that does not close s2; care must be taken with the double-close patch,
or it may leak a file descriptor instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the beginning of decode_cidr(), where in_ipaddr_str is from the
message sent by the user/attacker:

        char                    ipaddress[NI_MAXHOST];

the following code has two problems:

        char ipaddr_str[NI_MAXHOST];
        ...
        if (strlen(in_ipaddr_str) > NI_MAXHOST)
                strncpy(ipaddr_str, in_ipaddr_str, NI_MAXHOST);
        else
                strcpy(ipaddr_str, in_ipaddr_str);

1/ strlen(in_ipaddr_str) > NI_MAXHOST is possible, because the user's
ipaddress is not necessarily null-terminated, but in that case strncpy()
does not null-terminate ipaddr_str;

Note: other "strings" in the message sent by the user/attacker also
suffer from this (non) null-termination problem.

2/ if strlen(in_ipaddr_str) == NI_MAXHOST, the strcpy() triggers an
off-by-one overflow.

Note: this strncpy()/strcpy() pattern of bugs is repeated many times
throughout the codebase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In decode_cidr(), the strcpy(ipaddr_str, tok) is invalid, because tok
points to ipaddr_str, and "strings may not overlap" (man strcpy).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In decode_cidr(), int keepbits = atoi(tmp) may be negative (it comes
from the message sent by the user/attacker), which may bypass checks and
have other consequences in other parts of the code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In perform_ping(), int datalen comes from the message sent by the
user/attacker, but it is not checked at all: it looks like this could
lead to a heap overflow in fill_payload_data() (through
do_ping_from_nic_iface() -> prepare_icmpv6_req_pkt()).

(It seems that packet buffers are malloc()ated by alloc_packet(), called
only with alloc_packet(1500, 1500), and uip_slen in fill_payload_data()
is an u16_t, originally from the attacker-controlled int datalen, so it
may very well overflow this 1500-byte buffer -- but we did not double-
check this conclusion, and the lack of datalen checks may have other
consequences as well, but we did not explore them fully.)

The package reported in this upstream report, though, seem to have come from RH, but are nevertheless the same.  I believe these issues are fairly simple to address though:  - For iscsid_loop() simply check for root like iscsid checks  - For process_iscsid_broadcast():   * check the size of the payload "payload_len" before using it in a "fread()" operation.   * initialize the "rsp" structure to all zeros   * remove the double "close()" of the fdopen() file descriptor by removing one of the two "close()" calls  - In iscsid_ipc.c:   * fix the strcpy/strncpy string handling   * In decode_cidr() fix overlapping strings strcpy() with intermediate buffer   * In decode_cidr() fix the atoi() conversion by either using strtoul() or checking the result from atoi() before using it  - For the last issue, I still have to dip a bit deeper to figure out the best way to address this, but I'm pretty sure I can add a size check to the code  NOTE: I do NOT currently have any way to test the iscsiuio stuff, since I don't have a working Broadcom card. But perhaps Hannes/Johannes will be able to sanity test my final result?  Lastly: how do I address this upstream? I would like to submit my patches upstream first, as is usually done, but I believe I am not supposed to do that for VUL-0 bugs? Is that correct? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1072312#c4)  Lee Duncan   2017-12-13 16:40:33 UTC  ``` Adding NEEDSINFO ... ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1072312#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2017-12-13 21:21:37 UTC  ``` The issue is now public via oss-security.  Basically you can now just work as if this would be a normal bug without embargoe. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1072312#c7)  Lee Duncan   2017-12-15 21:31:38 UTC  ``` Changes submitted for Factory, and will be forwarded to other versions once accepted.  Also submitted upstream. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1072312#c8)  Lee Duncan   2017-12-19 23:46:09 UTC  ``` The python*-configshell-fb package has been submitted from devel:languages:python to openSUSE:Factory. See <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/557437>  I have a version of targetcli-fb that works for both python2 and for python3. I will submit it once these other two packages are in Factory. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1072312#c9)  Lee Duncan   2017-12-19 23:47:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Lee Duncan from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1072312#c8)) > The python*-configshell-fb package has been submitted from > devel:languages:python to openSUSE:Factory.
