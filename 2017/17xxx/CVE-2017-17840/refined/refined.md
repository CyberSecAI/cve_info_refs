Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-17840:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient input validation and improper handling of data within the `iscsiuio` daemon of the `iscsi-initiator-utils` package. This daemon listens on an abstract socket and processes messages from local users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unrestricted Local Access:** The `iscsid_loop()` function accepts connections on the abstract socket `ISCSID_UIP_ABSTRACT_NAMESPACE` from any local user without proper authorization checks. This allows any user on the system to send messages to `iscsiuio` and trigger the other vulnerabilities.
2.  **Heap Overflow in `process_iscsid_broadcast()`:** The `payload_len` value, read directly from the user-provided message without validation, is used in `fread()` to copy data to a fixed-size buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. While `FORTIFY` mitigates this by aborting the process, it is still a vulnerability.
3.  **Information Leak in `process_iscsid_broadcast()`:** The `rsp` variable is not initialized, and the `ping_sc` member is not initialized in certain code paths. This results in potentially leaking uninitialized stack data to the connected user.
4.  **Double Close in `process_iscsid_broadcast()`:** The file descriptor `s2` is closed twice, once by `fclose(fd)` and again by `close(s2)`. This can lead to closing an unintended file if another thread reuses the file descriptor in between the calls.
5.  **String Handling Issues in `decode_cidr()`:**
    *   The function uses `strncpy()` without proper null-termination if the length of the input string exceeds the buffer size.
    *   An off-by-one overflow occurs when using `strcpy()` if the input string length equals the buffer size `NI_MAXHOST`.
    *   The function uses `strcpy()` with overlapping strings, where the destination and source memory overlap, resulting in undefined behavior.
6.  **Negative `keepbits` in `decode_cidr()`:** The function uses `atoi()` to convert the user-controlled input to an integer, which can be negative. This negative value is not checked and can cause issues later in the code.
7.  **Heap Overflow via `datalen` in `perform_ping()`:**  The `datalen` value, provided by the user in the message, is not checked before being used in `fill_payload_data()`. This can lead to a heap overflow. The `uip_slen`, derived from the attacker-controlled `datalen`, can overflow a 1500-byte buffer allocated by `alloc_packet`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow vulnerability in `process_iscsid_broadcast()` or `perform_ping()` could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, although the use of FORTIFY in builds will prevent a direct overflow.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The uninitialized `rsp` variable in `process_iscsid_broadcast()` can leak sensitive information to an attacker.
*   **Denial of Service:** The double-close vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service by closing the wrong file, and the heap overflow will also cause a crash.
*   **Other Potential Issues**: The negative `keepbits` value and string handling errors can potentially cause other issues that could further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User:** Any local user can connect to the `iscsiuio` daemon via the abstract socket and send malicious messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have an account on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of the Abstract Socket Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the abstract socket (`@ISCSID_UIP_ABSTRACT_NAMESPACE`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issues were discovered by the Qualys Security Advisory team.
*   The vulnerability is present in `iscsi-initiator-utils`.
*   The `iscsiuio` daemon is part of the `open-iscsi` package.
*   Patches were created to address these vulnerabilities, including input validation checks, structure initialization, and removing double closes.
*   The `FORTIFY` protection is only a mitigation, not a fix, and the underlying issue should still be patched.
