Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17578:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `latest_news_details.php` script of the FS Crowdfunding Script 1.0. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other application data. The provided exploit example shows how to extract database, user and version information as well as database table names and column names.
- **Data Modification:** With SQL injection, an attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** In some cases, a successful SQL injection could be a stepping stone for further attacks, such as gaining access to the server's operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `latest_news_details.php` page.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to inject data into the results.
- The exploit also uses functions such as `CONCAT_WS`, `USER()`, `DATABASE()`, `VERSION()`, `export_set`, `count(*)` and `information_schema.columns` to extract information from the database.
- The vulnerability affects FS Crowdfunding Script 1.0, as stated in the exploit information.
