Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17105:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper access controls on the Zivif web camera, allowing direct calls to CGI functions without authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated remote command injection:** The `iptest.cgi` script is vulnerable to command injection through the `-url` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the camera's operating system. In the example provided, the attacker is able to reboot the device. The commands are executed by the system, even if the results are not returned to the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Remote, unauthenticated HTTP requests:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `iptest.cgi` endpoint. The attacker needs to know the IP address of the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable device on the network. No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable request is:
`http://<Camera IP>/cgi-bin/iptest.cgi?cmd=iptest.cgi&-time="1504225666237"&-url=$(reboot)`
This injects the command `reboot` into the `-url` parameter, causing the device to restart.
