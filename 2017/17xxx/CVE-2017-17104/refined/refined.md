```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from `$_GET['src']` and `$_GET['name']` into a file path without proper sanitization, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Traversal",
    "Arbitrary File Read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, which can lead to the leakage of sensitive information, such as configuration files or database credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious GET request to `dapur/apps/app_theme/libs/check_file.php` with manipulated `src` and `name` parameters, an attacker can specify any file path on the server to be read.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application endpoint."
