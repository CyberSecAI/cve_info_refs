Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Arithmetic errors in the Xen hypervisor's memory scrubbing mechanism during boot. Specifically, when memory was in disjoint blocks or didn't begin at physical address 0, the scrubbing process failed to cover all memory regions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incomplete memory scrubbing: The hypervisor failed to overwrite all memory with zeroes at boot, leaving residual data from previous domains in DRAM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leak: Sensitive data from a previous domain could be read by another domain after a reboot. This could include passwords, cryptographic keys, or other confidential information.
- Potential privilege escalation if leaked data enables access to more privileged resources or systems

**Attack Vectors:**
- Rebooting: The attack is triggered by a system reboot where the memory is not correctly scrubbed, allowing a subsequent domain access to data in unscrubbed memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control a domain on a vulnerable system and the system needs to reboot at some point.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the memory after the reboot.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ARM systems.
- All versions of Xen since 4.5 are vulnerable.
- Hardware with disjoint memory blocks or physical addresses not starting at 0 are vulnerable (most ARM systems).
- The provided Xen Security Advisory (XSA-245) confirms the public discussion of the bug before it was recognized as a security vulnerability.
- Gentoo's GLSA 201801-14 also references this CVE as one of the multiple vulnerabilities fixed in updated packages, rating it as high severity and exploitable locally.
- Debian's DLA-1549-1 also references this CVE as a vulnerability fixed in an update to the Xen package.
