The provided content is related to CVE-2017-17042.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `File.cleanpath` method in the `yard` gem not properly sanitizing relative paths, allowing an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `File.cleanpath` method did not correctly handle relative paths starting with `../`, which could lead to directory traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server where the `yard` gem is used by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability in `File.cleanpath`. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could provide a specially crafted path containing `../` sequences to the `File.cleanpath` method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input path string that is passed to `File.cleanpath`. This could occur in a web application where user input is used to construct file paths.
