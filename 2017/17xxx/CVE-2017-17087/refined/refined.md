Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Vim handles the creation of swap files (.swp). Specifically, when creating a swap file, Vim sets the group ownership of the .swp file to the primary group of the user running the editor, which might differ from the group of the original file being edited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Group Ownership:** Vim incorrectly sets the group ownership of the swap file, potentially leading to broader access than intended.
*   **Information Exposure:** When the editor's primary group differs from the original file's group, the swap file can become readable by unintended users.
*   **Ignoring Umask:** Although not the primary issue of this CVE, some discussions mentioned that Vim does not respect umask when creating swap files. This means that the swap file's permissions are not modified by the user's umask settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Local users can potentially gain access to sensitive information by reading the swap file. This is especially concerning for system files like `/etc/shadow`, which contains password hashes.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** By reading sensitive configuration files through swap files, attackers might obtain credentials or other sensitive data which can be used for further privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable Vim version is being used.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read files within the file system where a .swp file is created. This typically requires that the attacker has a user account on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a user on the target system.
*   **Group Membership:** The attacker's group membership must allow them to read the swap file, which is often a result of the swap file's incorrect group ownership.
*   **Awareness of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and the location of potentially sensitive swap files.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in `fileio.c` in Vim versions prior to 8.0.1263.
*   The fix involves checking the group permissions of the original file and, if the group read permission is set but the world read permission is not, attempts to set the swap file group to match that of the original file or resets the group-read bit if that fails.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated through the example of `/etc/shadow`, where a root user with "users" as their primary group editing the file will create a swap file that is readable by all users, even if `/etc/shadow` is not world-readable.
*   This CVE is separate from CVE-2017-1000382 which focused on information disclosure via web servers exposing .swp files, while this is related to local system information disclosure due to incorrect file permissions.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade Vim to version 8.0.1263 or later.
*   As a workaround, use Vim's `set directory` option to store swap files in a more secure location like `~/.vim/swap` which the user owns.
*   Ensure that the primary group of users, especially privileged users, is set appropriately.
