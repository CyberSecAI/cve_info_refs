- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient packet validation of H.323 packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to send malicious packets, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS) attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted H.323 packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to gain access to the network where the affected products are located. The attacker does not require authentication.
