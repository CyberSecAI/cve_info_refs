The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in a "Ready Made Job Site Script", but it does not include any information related to CVE-2017-17895.

The vulnerabilities described are:

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Root Cause**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `keyword` parameter of the job search functionality.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The application does not properly encode or sanitize the user-supplied `keyword` parameter before rendering it in the HTML output.
   - **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's response, potentially leading to user session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
   - **Attack Vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `keyword` parameter via an HTTP POST request to the `/job` endpoint.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests to the application, typically achievable through a malicious link or a form on a separate website.

**2. SQL Injection (SQLi)**
   - **Root Cause**: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input within the `location_name[]` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
   - **Impact of Exploitation**: The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive database information, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.
   - **Attack Vectors**: The attacker injects SQL code through the `location_name[]` parameter via an HTTP POST request to the `/job` endpoint.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests to the application.

**3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - **Root Cause**: The application does not properly protect against CSRF attacks.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The lack of anti-CSRF tokens allows an attacker to trick users into performing unwanted actions on the site.
   - **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can make a user perform actions without their consent, such as changing their account settings or injecting XSS payloads.
   - **Attack Vectors**: The attacker crafts an HTML form on another website that, when submitted by a logged-in user of the vulnerable application, will execute the attacker's desired actions on the vulnerable site.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs the ability to create an external webpage and trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable application into visiting it.

**Conclusion:**

The content details multiple vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, and CSRF) in a "Ready Made Job Site Script". However, it doesn't have any relation to CVE-2017-17895.

**Response:** UNRELATED
