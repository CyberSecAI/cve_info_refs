Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of an outdated and vulnerable version of WestWind Webserver within Conarc iChannel. The specific issue is that the `/wc.dll?wwMaint~EditConfig` page, which allows for webserver configuration edits, is accessible without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Restrictions:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication on the configuration edit page, allowing anyone with network access to reach it.
- **Default Webserver Misconfiguration:**  The outdated WestWind Webserver has a vulnerable configuration that exposes the sensitive configuration edit page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** The configuration edit page exposes sensitive server information.
- **Webserver Configuration Alteration:** An attacker can modify the webserver configuration.
- **Arbitrary File Upload/Modification:** Attackers can upload or modify server configurations.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can delete the server's configuration, causing a denial of service.
- **Complete Server Compromise:**  If the iChannel install is publicly accessible, exploitation can result in the compromise of the entire server and web application, and severe information leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to access the vulnerable page, `/wc.dll?wwMaint~EditConfig`, via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target server hosting the vulnerable iChannel application. No authentication is required.
