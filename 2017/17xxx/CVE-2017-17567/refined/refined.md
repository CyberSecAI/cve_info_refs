Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in "Readymade Classifieds Script" as described in the provided markdown file:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthorized Access:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  A backend administrative link (`http://live.posty.in/admin/user_activate_submit.php`) is directly accessible to unauthenticated users/visitors.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of proper access controls and authentication on sensitive administrative pages.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information or the possibility of exploitation by malicious users.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the vulnerable URL.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** None, as the vulnerability is accessible to any visitor

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `ID` parameter in the `user_activate_submit.php` script is vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input.
    *  **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript payload in the `ID` parameter. Example: `<http://live.posty.in/admin/user_activate_submit.php?ID=457%27%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(/xss/)%3E%3C%27%22>`
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Able to craft and deliver a malicious link to a user, or trick the user into visiting it

3.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `user_activate_submit.php` script is vulnerable to SQL Injection. While the specific injection point is not explicitly stated, it is implied to be within the same script due to the grouping with the XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Improper handling and sanitization of user input when constructing SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to access or modify database contents, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or application compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating URL parameters to inject SQL code.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Able to craft a malicious URL with SQL injection payload and deliver to the target application.

**Summary:**

The Readymade Classifieds Script has multiple critical vulnerabilities: unauthorized access to administrative pages, reflected XSS, and SQL injection.
