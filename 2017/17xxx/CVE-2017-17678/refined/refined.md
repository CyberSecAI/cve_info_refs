{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The BMC Remedy system exposes the BIRT report engine without sufficient restrictions, allowing for various types of attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote and Local File Inclusion: Allows an attacker to include arbitrary files.",
      "Internal Path Disclosure: Allows disclosure of internal file paths through verbose error messages.",
      "Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected XSS affecting both authenticated and unauthenticated users.",
       "Cross-Site Script Include:  Dynamically generated JavaScript containing environmental variables can be included by malicious third-party sites to steal the CSRF token.",
       "Log Hijacking: Remote logging can be accessed by unauthenticated users, allowing attackers to hijack system logs, which may contain usernames and cookies.",
      "Session Token Disclosure: Session token value included in some HTTP responses, bypassing the httponly flag.",
      "Authenticated Code Execution: Users with report creation rights can execute code through BIRT templates."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerabilities allow for:\n- System fingerprinting\n- Internal port scanning\n- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n- Remote code execution\n- Internal path disclosure\n- Hijacking of system logs, potentially revealing usernames and cookies.\n- Session token theft\n- Code execution through BIRT templates.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Exploiting the BIRT report engine to include arbitrary internal/external files through crafted requests.",
      "Triggering verbose error messages via the BIRT report engine by including non-existent files.",
      "Crafting malicious links or web pages to trigger reflected XSS.",
      "Including BMCâ€™s dynamically generated JavaScript on malicious third-party sites.",
      "Accessing the remote logging service without authentication.",
      "Intercepting HTTP responses containing the session token.",
       "Exploiting the BIRT template functionality to gain code execution by creating a malicious report template"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the BMC Remedy system. Some attacks, like the XSS, Log Hijacking, and Session Token Disclosure, can be executed by unauthenticated users. Code execution requires report creation rights, which seem to be granted to all users by default.  For the Cross-Site Script Include vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to host a malicious site."
