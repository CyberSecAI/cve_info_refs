- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of certain values in RSA certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak cryptography, specifically related to RSA certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can forge a specific RSA certificate, bypass identity authentication, and log into the target device, gaining permissions associated with the specified username. This leads to unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access using SSH.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to reach the target device's SSH server.
    - The SSH server must be configured to use RSA authentication for a specific username.
    - The attacker must know the correct username.
    - The attacker needs to create a specially crafted RSA certificate.
