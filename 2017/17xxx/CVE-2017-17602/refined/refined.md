Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17602

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `tradeshow-list-detail.php` and `view-product.php` files of the Advance B2B Script 2.1.3 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks via the `show_id` parameter in `tradeshow-list-detail.php` and the `pid` parameter in `view-product.php`. Both boolean-based blind and UNION query SQL injection techniques can be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- The attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data loss or corruption.
- In more advanced cases, the attacker might be able to gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests.
-  The attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `show_id` and `pid` parameters of the respective URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the server side to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- **`tradeshow-list-detail.php`**:
    - Vulnerable parameter: `show_id` (GET)
    - Type: Boolean-based blind and UNION query
    - Example payloads provided, using `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract data.
- **`view-product.php`**:
    - Vulnerable parameter: `pid` (GET)
    - Type: Boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query
    - Example payloads provided to demonstrate boolean-based, time-based and UNION query exploitation
    - Example also demonstrates using `CONCAT_WS` to extract database information

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit examples show how to use `UNION ALL SELECT` to retrieve data by injecting specific SQL queries.
- The exploit examples use `SLEEP()` for time based SQL injection.
- The exploit examples also show how to use `CONCAT` and `CONCAT_WS` to retrieve data.
- The exploit examples use boolean-based blind techniques by injecting `AND 2728=2728` to test for vulnerability.
- The content provides examples for both boolean-based blind and UNION query SQL injection.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the SQL injection vulnerabilities present in Advance B2B Script 2.1.3 and how they can be exploited.
