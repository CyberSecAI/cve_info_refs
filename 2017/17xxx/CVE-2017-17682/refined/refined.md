Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-17682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `ReadWPGImage` function within the `coders/wpg.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, the `ExtractPostscript` function within `ReadWPGImage` uses a potentially attacker-controlled `PS_Size` value which is not validated leading to an integer overflow or very large value. This results in a large loop iterating based on `PS_Size` which is used to extract data from the image, which leads to excessive resource usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CPU Exhaustion):** The primary vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition due to excessive CPU consumption. The large `PS_Size` causes a loop that reads bytes one at a time, resulting in a prolonged process that consumes substantial CPU resources, essentially leading to an infinite loop.
- **Integer Overflow:** While not explicitly stated, the large value of `PS_Size` suggests a potential integer overflow issue where the provided size may be larger than what can be handled, or may wrap around leading to unexpected results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit will render the ImageMagick process unresponsive and exhaust CPU resources.
- **Application Unavailability:** Applications that rely on ImageMagick for image processing could become unavailable or sluggish, impacting the user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted WPG Image:** The attack vector is a specially crafted WPG image file with a large `PS_Size` value designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input File:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted WPG image file to a system that processes it using ImageMagick. This could be via direct file upload, a link, or any other way of providing user-controlled input to be processed by ImageMagick.
- **No Specific Privilege Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges. Any user or automated system that processes the malicious image file using ImageMagick is vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided `gdb` output gives a clear picture of where the issue occurs: inside the `while(PS_Size-- > 0)` loop in the `ExtractPostscript` function, with a large `PS_Size` value leading to the excessive loop and subsequent `ReadBlobByte` calls that cause the CPU exhaustion.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by validating the size of `PS_Size` to avoid excessively long loops.
