# Dangerous URL Redirection and CSRF in Zoho ManageEngine AD Manager Plus (CVE-2017-17552) (Updated)

**Vendor**: Zoho Corp.

**Product**: ManageEngine ADManager Plus

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2017-17552](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=cve-2017-17552)

**Discoverer:** Douglas Weir (dbweir19\_a\_lavabit\_com)

**CVSS v3 Score:** 6.5

**CVSS v3 Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Versions**: Build 6590 – 6613 (earlier builds may also be affected).

**Link**: <https://www.manageengine.com/products/ad-manager/>

**Product Description**: The ManageEngine ADManager Plus software is a management and reporting solution for Windows Active Directories.

## **Summary**:

Dangerous URL Redirection and Cross-site Request Forgery

## **Details**:

**Vulnerability**: Dangerous URL Redirection

**Impact**: A remote unauthenticated user can use this flaw to masquerade an arbitrary URL as appearing to originate from AD Manager Plus.

**Details**: The /LoadFrame resource in the AD Manager Plus web application includes a src parameter which is vulnerable to manipulation.  Using the /LoadFrame resource URLs of the kind shown below can be created.

```
hxxps://ad.manager.plus.domain/LoadFrame?src=hxxps://evil.url.otherdomain&frame_name=foo
```

When such a URL is clicked, the browser’s address bar shows the expected address, but the content displayed in the browser is that supplied by hxxps://evil.url.otherdomain loaded inside of an IFRAME.  An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to expose their malicious content to end-users while exploiting the trust imparted by a familiar address in the browser’s address bar.

**Vulnerability**: Cross-site Request Forgery

**Impact**: A remote attacker can use this flaw to defeat the CSRF protections in AD Manager Plus

**Details**: The /LoadFrame resource in AD Manager Plus sends a POST request to the URL supplied in the src parameter and instructs the browser to load the response in an IFRAME.  This request includes a POST parameter called **adcsrf**  whose value is an anti-CSRF token created by the AD Manager Plus application. If the URL provided in the src parameter belongs to the same AD Manager Plus application an adcsrf token will be sent back to the application.  An attacker can use this /LoadFrame resource to defeat the applications anti-CSRF protection.  An example of such an attack might be:

```
hxxps://ad.manager.plus.domain/LoadFrame?src=hxxps://ad.manager.plus.domain/someFunction.do&frame_name=foo
```

When an end-user (who is already authenticated to AD Manager Plus) clicks on such a link, the AD Manager Plus application will perform the specified action because it believes the request is genuine since it was accompanied by a valid CSRF token (supplied by the /LoadFrame wrapper)

## Remediation

Zoho Corp has provided a [patch](https://uploads.zohocorp.com/Internal_Useruploads/ADManager_Plus/o_1c12psre5dvh1ou01mlksp9hpp1/Cx_Patch.zip) for AD Manager Plus **build 6610 only**.  The installation instructions are found below.

>

> * “Web.xlm” by renaming it as   “Web.xml\_bak” which is  located in “<Installation directory>\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\webapps\adsm\WEB-INF\”.
> * “AdventNetADSMJspClient.jar” by renaming it as “AdventNetADSMJspClient.jar\_bak”which is  located in “<Installation directory>\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\webapps\adsm\WEB-INF\lib”
>
> 3. Extract and save following files from the patch downloaded :
>
> * “Security.xml” to “<Installation directory>\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\webapps\adsm\WEB-INF\security”.
> * “Web.xml”  to  “<Installation directory>\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\webapps\adsm\WEB-INF\”.
> * “AdventNetADSMJspClient.jar”  to “<Installation directory>\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\webapps\adsm\WEB-INF\lib”
>
