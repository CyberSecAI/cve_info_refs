- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application sends username and password in cleartext during the initial connection request, and stores them in plain text on the server-side. The client-side checks the credentials, allowing an attacker to intercept the credentials and gain full access. Additionally, communication between the client and server is unencrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cleartext transmission of credentials
    - Cleartext storage of credentials
    - Client-side authentication
    - Unencrypted communication
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can sniff network traffic, capture credentials, and gain full access to the home automation system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network sniffing/traffic interception.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between the client application and the server. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack or by sniffing traffic on the same network as the client and server.
