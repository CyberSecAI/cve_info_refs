{
  "CVE-2017-17448": {
    "root_cause": "Missing capabilities check in the netfilter component",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Bypass intended access restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "Unprivileged users can gain access to system wide data structures",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege in any user namespace"
    ],
    "details": "The net/netfilter/nfnetlink_cthelper.c function in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for new, get, and del operations. This allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions because the nfnl_cthelper_list data structure is shared across all net namespaces."
