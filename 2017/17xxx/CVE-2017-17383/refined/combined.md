# Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-12-05

This advisory announces a vulnerability in Jenkins (weekly and LTS) and various plugins.

|  | This advisory has been superseded by the entry for [Ant Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ant) in the [2018-01-22 security advisory](../2018-01-22/#xss-vulnerability-in-job-configuration-forms-in-ant-plugin). |

## Description

### Stored XSS vulnerability in tool names exploitable by administrators

**SECURITY-624**

Jenkins administrators can configure tools, such as JDK, Maven, or Ant, that will be available in job configurations for use by build scripts.

Some tool names are not properly escaped on job configuration forms, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Tools confirmed to be affected are:

* JDK (provided by Jenkins core)
* Ant (provided by Ant plugin)

Others may also be affected by this.

|  | This vulnerability can only be exploited by Jenkins administrators, as they’re the only ones able to define tools. In regular Jenkins configurations, administrators are able to run any code and install any plugin. Therefore this vulnerability only really affects installations that don’t grant administrators the Run Scripts, Configure Update Sites, and/or Install Plugins permissions. |
| --- | --- |

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

The Jenkins project has prepared a plugin preventing the configuration of unsafe tool names at <https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/security624>.
If you’re affected by this issue (i.e. are operating an instance restricting the permissions of administrators) we recommend installing the above plugin.
You will need to build this plugin yourself.
We are not planning to distribute it on our update sites, as we are unaware of any open source plugins enabling a configuration that would be affected by this vulnerability.

## Severity

* SECURITY-624: **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)**

## Affected versions

## Fix

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix available other than the workaround provided above.
