- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper escaping of tool names on job configuration forms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By configuring a tool (like JDK or Ant) with a malicious name containing JavaScript code, an attacker can inject the script. The injected script will then be executed when other users view the job configuration form where the tool name is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have Jenkins administrator privileges to define the malicious tool name.

The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability is most relevant in Jenkins installations that restrict administrator permissions. A mitigation plugin is provided for those affected.
