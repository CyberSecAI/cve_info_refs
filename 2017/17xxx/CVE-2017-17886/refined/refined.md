Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17886:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a memory leak in the `ReadPSDChannelZip` function within the `coders/psd.c` file of ImageMagick. This function is used when processing compressed PSD (Photoshop) image channels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Leak:** The primary issue is that memory allocated within the `ReadPSDChannelZip` function is not properly freed, leading to a memory leak. Specifically, the code allocates memory using `AcquireQuantumMemory` but doesn't release it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly processing crafted PSD files with this vulnerability can exhaust available memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition as the system runs out of resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted PSD file to ImageMagick. When ImageMagick attempts to process this file, the memory leak is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PSD file to a system using ImageMagick. This could be through a web application that processes user-uploaded images, a shared file system, or any other scenario where ImageMagick is used to process external input.

**Additional Details:**

- The GitHub issue report includes a specific test case (a PSD file) that triggers the leak.
- The Ubuntu security notice (USN-3681-1) confirms that this vulnerability was addressed in updated packages. The USN also mentions that, if a user or automated system using ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. Although code execution is mentioned here, the provided analysis is focused on the memory leak, and the provided content does not elaborate on code execution as a result of this specific vulnerability.
- The provided Github issue includes a stack trace from AddressSanitizer which clearly pinpoints the leak in `ReadPSDChannelZip` at `coders/psd.c:1236` and also the call stack leading to the leak.

In summary, CVE-2017-17886 is a memory leak vulnerability in ImageMagick's PSD processing code, specifically within `ReadPSDChannelZip`, that could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly processing a crafted PSD file.
