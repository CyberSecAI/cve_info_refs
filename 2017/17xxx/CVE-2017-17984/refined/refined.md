The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities found in the "Muslim Matrimonial Script". While it does not directly reference CVE-2017-17984, the types of vulnerabilities are relevant and worth analyzing.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
    *   **Root Cause:**  Lack of input sanitization/validation in URL parameters.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable parameters in `event_edit.php`, `slider_edit.php`, `state_view.php`, and `caste_view.php` allow injecting JavaScript code via URL parameters.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript are used to trigger XSS in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser which can lead to account compromise, session hijacking, and other malicious actions.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of sanitization of user-supplied input when storing data in the application's database, specifically the `event_title` field.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The `event_add.php` script is vulnerable to storing malicious JavaScript through the `event_title` POST parameter.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** A POST request with malicious JavaScript within the `event_title` field is sent to the server, and the malicious script is stored in the database.
    *   **Impact:** JavaScript code is stored and executed when viewed by other users of the application. Similar impacts to Reflected XSS.
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send POST requests to the server, typically requiring an account.

3.  **SQL Injection (SQLi)**:
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization in the `mem_id` parameter when querying the database.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The `view-rofile.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection by manipulating the `mem_id` parameter (which is base64 encoded) in the URL.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Modifying the base64 encoded `mem_id` parameter in the URL to include SQL injection payloads.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to manipulate database queries, leading to information disclosure, data modification, or complete database compromise.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The ability to craft a URL with a SQL injection payload

4.  **Arbitrary File Upload**:
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of file type validation and proper sanitization when processing file uploads.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The `mydetails_edit.php` script allows uploading files of any type via the `user_photo` parameter.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** POST request with a malicious file of any content is uploaded through `user_photo`.
    *   **Impact:** The ability to upload any file type allows an attacker to upload malicious code (e.g., a web shell) leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The ability to send POST requests to the server.

5.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection, such as tokens, to verify that a request originates from the legitimate user.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The `subadmin_edit.php` script is vulnerable as it lacks CSRF protection allowing a forged request to be submitted.
    *    **Attack Vectors:** A crafted HTML page is used to trigger a request to modify settings when a user is logged in.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute actions in the application with the privileges of a logged-in user, such as changing settings or injecting malicious data.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create and host a malicious HTML page.
