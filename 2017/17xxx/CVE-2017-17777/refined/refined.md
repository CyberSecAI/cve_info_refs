The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in "Paid To Read Script," but does not specifically reference CVE-2017-17777.

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leak:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper error handling and lack of input validation when accessing certain pages with invalid parameters.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Exposes absolute server paths.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive server information, potentially aiding further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP request to vulnerable pages with crafted parameters (e.g., `uid=12'`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed, just knowledge of the vulnerable URLs.

*   **Unauthorized Access:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper access controls or session management for certain admin panel pages.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Allows access to restricted administrative functionalities without authentication.
    *   **Impact:**  Ability to view sensitive user and system data.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Directly accessing vulnerable URLs with predictable parameters (e.g., `fn=7`, `uid=13`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges are needed.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper sanitization and encoding of user-supplied input reflected in the output.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Allows injection of malicious client-side scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript within parameters (e.g., `id=10&tier=1'%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E%3C'%22`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the victim to click on a malicious link.

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *  **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within SQL queries.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *  **Impact:**  Ability to read, modify, or delete data from the database; potential for complete system compromise.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating vulnerable parameters with SQL injection payloads (e.g., `id=10`).
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed.
