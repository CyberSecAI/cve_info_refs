The provided content is related to CVE-2017-17675.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The BMC Remedy system exposes the BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools) report engine without sufficient restrictions, allowing attackers to include arbitrary external or internal files. This is caused by the lack of input validation and proper access controls on the report engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote and Local File Inclusion:** The BIRT report engine allows inclusion of arbitrary files, potentially leading to system fingerprinting, internal port scanning, SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), and remote code execution.
*   **Internal Path Disclosure:** The BIRT report engine discloses internal file paths through verbose error messages when including non-existent files.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A reflected XSS vulnerability affects both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
*   **Cross-Site Script Include (XSSI):** Dynamically generated JavaScript used for environmental variables can be included by a malicious third-party site to steal CSRF tokens.
*   **Log Hijacking:** Unauthenticated users can access remote logging of the system logs, including usernames and HTTP data (including cookies).
*   **Session Token Disclosure:** HTTP responses sometimes include the session token, potentially allowing JavaScript to steal it and bypass the HTTPOnly flag.
*   **Authenticated Code Execution:** Authenticated users with report creation privileges can execute arbitrary code through BIRT templating.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote and Local File Inclusion:** Allows attackers to gain sensitive information, scan the internal network, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Internal Path Disclosure:** Enables attackers to map the internal file system structure and identify sensitive locations.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Cross-Site Script Include (XSSI):** Enables attackers to steal CSRF tokens, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
*   **Log Hijacking:** Enables attackers to gain sensitive information, including usernames and potentially session data from logs.
*   **Session Token Disclosure:** Enables session hijacking.
*   **Authenticated Code Execution:** Allows authenticated users to fully compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The file inclusion vulnerabilities are exploited through the exposed BIRT report engine.
*   XSS is exploited through crafted URLs that inject malicious scripts.
*   XSSI is exploited by including the vulnerable JavaScript file on a malicious page.
*   Log hijacking occurs by accessing the exposed logging service.
*   Session token disclosure is exploited by capturing and analyzing HTTP responses.
*   Authenticated code execution is achieved by crafting malicious BIRT report templates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For Remote and Local File Inclusion, Internal Path Disclosure, Log Hijacking, and Session Token Disclosure, the attacker does not need authentication.
*   For XSS and XSSI the attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious link/website.
*   For Authenticated Code Execution, the attacker needs to be a valid user with report creation privileges.
