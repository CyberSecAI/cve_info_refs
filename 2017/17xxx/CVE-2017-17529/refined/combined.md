As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  openSUSE (At this moment openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.0 and Tumbleweed) please feel free to reopen this bug against that version (!you must update the "Version" component in the bug fields, do not just reopen please), or alternatively create a new ticket.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed during the lifetime of the release.

The --with-gnomevfs option is only for gtk2, but we build Abiword with gtk3.

Also, it would be an RC bug to actually depend on gnome-vfs [1]

<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/02/msg00169.html>

Has this issue even been reported to the Abiword developers?

Thanks,

Don't think this was ever forwarded to abiword's upstream. Is abiword
upstream still active?

Yes.

Here's a git mirror of their svn repo. The git mirror is sometimes a
bit out of date.

Thanks, indeed for the pointer.

Can you forward the issue to upstream?

Hi,

Are you sure this is vulnerable ? I did not manage to trigger anything
problematic.

The code referenced is (in fallback_open_uri):

gint    argc;
gchar **argv = NULL;
char   *cmd_line = g_strconcat (browser, " %1", NULL);

if (g_shell_parse_argv (cmd_line, &argc, &argv, err)) {
  /* check for '%1' in an argument and substitute the url
   * otherwise append it */
  gint i;
  char *tmp;

  for (i = 1 ; i < argc ; i++)
    if (NULL != (tmp = strstr (argv[i], "%1"))) {
      *tmp = '\0';
      tmp = g_strconcat (argv[i],
        (clean_url != NULL) ? (char const *)clean_url : url,
        tmp+2, NULL);
      g_free (argv[i]);
      argv[i] = tmp;
      break;
    }

  /* there was actually a %1, drop the one we added */
  if (i != argc-1) {
    g_free (argv[argc-1]);
    argv[argc-1] = NULL;
  }
  g_spawn_async (NULL, argv, NULL, G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH,
    NULL, NULL, NULL, err);
  g_strfreev (argv);
}
g_free (cmd_line);

This seems correct with respect to injection through the URI:
the URI string cannot be expanded into multiple arguments
and is not passed to `system()`.

Did you got a chance to ping upstream on that issue and report it?

Agreed, this CVE seems like a non issue, the CVE entry at MITRE
also only refers back to the Security Tracker...

Cheers,

No, but you can if you like.

<https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/AbiWord> is the current source repo, but
you might need to still use bugzilla for reporting issues.

Thanks,
