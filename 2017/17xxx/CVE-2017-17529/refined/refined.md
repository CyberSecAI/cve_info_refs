{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-17529",
  "description": "af/util/xp/ut_go_file.cpp in AbiWord 3.0.2-2 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in `af/util/xp/ut_go_file.cpp` before launching an external program via the BROWSER environment variable. The software fails to sanitize the URL, leading to potential argument injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Argument injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially inject malicious arguments into the command line used to launch the browser, leading to arbitrary code execution or other unintended consequences.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted URL"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL which, when opened by AbiWord, would trigger the vulnerable code path. This can be done remotely by sending a document or link containing the crafted URL to a victim, or locally by crafting a malicious document containing the URL.",
      "required_position": "The attacker does not need to be local, and can exploit this through crafted documents or links."
