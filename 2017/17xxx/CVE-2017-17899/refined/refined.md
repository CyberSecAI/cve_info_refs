The provided content is related to the following CVE: CVE-2017-17899

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit addresses a security vulnerability reported by ADLab of Venustech. The specific vulnerability is not explicitly stated but the changes in the commit suggest multiple issues related to direct access to template files and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Direct template access:** Multiple template files in `htdocs/cashdesk/tpl/` were directly accessible via URL, bypassing necessary security checks. This is evident by the addition of the following code block in `facturation1.tpl.php`, `liste_articles.tpl.php`, `menu.tpl.php`, `ticket.tpl.php`, `validation1.tpl.php`, `validation2.tpl.php`:
```php
if (empty($langs) || ! is_object($langs))
{
  print "Error, template page can't be called as URL";
  exit;
}
```
This code prevents direct access by checking for the presence of `$langs` object.

2.  **SQL injection:** The `multiprix.php`, `fourn/index.php` and `main.inc.php` files contain modifications related to SQL injection prevention.
   - In `multiprix.php`, the code was using `$_GET["id"]` directly without sanitization in database queries. This was fixed by using `GETPOST('id', 'int')` which sanitizes the value, as well as using it for the  `$soc->fetch()` function:
     ```diff
     - $soc->fetch($_GET["id"]);
     + $soc->fetch($id);
     ```
     and also by updating `header()`
    ```diff
    - header("Location: multiprix.php?id=".$_GET["id"]);
    + header("Location: multiprix.php?id=".$id);
    ```
   - In `fourn/index.php`, `$_GET["socid"]` was being used directly without sanitization. This was fixed by using  `GETPOST("socid", 'int')`:
    ```diff
    - $socid = isset($_GET["socid"])?$_GET["socid"]:'';
    + $socid = GETPOST("socid", 'int');
    ```
    - The file `main.inc.php` contains an added regular expression check in the `test_sql_and_script_inject()` function, that tries to identify SQL injection attempts:
    ```diff
    - $inj += preg_match('/delete\s+from/i', $val);
    - $inj += preg_match('/updatexml^(/i', $val);
    + $inj += preg_match('/delete\s+from/i', $val);
    + $inj += preg_match('/create\s+table/i', $val);
    + $inj += preg_match('/update.+set.+=/i', $val);
    + $inj += preg_match('/insert\s+into/i', $val);
    ```
3. **Unsanitized input:** In `adherents/subscription/info.php`, the code was using `$_GET["rowid"]` directly without sanitization:
```diff
-$rowid=isset($_GET["rowid"])?$_GET["rowid"]:$_POST["rowid"];
+$rowid=GETPOST("rowid",'int');
```

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Direct template access:** Allows an attacker to access template files directly which may expose sensitive information or allow further exploitation by providing an avenue to execute arbitrary code.
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL queries, allowing them to read, modify, or delete database data, potentially leading to data breaches, loss of integrity, or complete system compromise.
- **Unsanitized input:** Leads to vulnerabilities such as SQL injections.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct template access:** By requesting the template files directly via their URL.
- **SQL injection:** By manipulating GET/POST parameters, such as the `id` parameter in `multiprix.php`, the `socid` parameter in `fourn/index.php`, and the `rowid` parameter in `adherents/subscription/info.php`, to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Direct template access:** Basic knowledge of the web application file structure is needed.
- **SQL injection:** Ability to craft malicious SQL queries and knowledge of the application's parameters.
