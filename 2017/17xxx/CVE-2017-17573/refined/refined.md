Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the FS Ebay Clone 1.0 application, which allows for SQL injection. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `id`, `sub_category_id`, and `category_id` parameters in the `product.php` and `search.php` files respectively.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi). This occurs due to the application's failure to properly sanitize user-controlled data before incorporating it into SQL queries. The vulnerability is present in the `product.php` file's `id` parameter and the `search.php` file's `sub_category_id` and `category_id` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to:
*   Extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other potentially valuable information.
*   Modify or delete data within the database.
*   Potentially gain further access to the server depending on the database user's privileges and the web server's configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are the HTTP GET parameters within the vulnerable PHP files:
* `product.php?id=[SQL]`
* `search.php?category_id=1&sub_category_id=[SQL]`
* `search.php?category_id=[SQL]`

The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the parameters, which is then executed by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges or local access are needed; this vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The attacker can use tools such as a web browser or other HTTP client.

**Additional details:**
The exploit examples provided in the content shows how to retrieve database table names, column names, and admin credentials using `UNION SELECT` statements. The examples include:
* Retrieving table names from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
* Retrieving column names from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` for the 'admin' table.
* Retrieving admin id, username and passwords from the admin table

The exploit also shows how to use `GROUP_CONCAT` and `SEPARATOR` to combine multiple rows into one result, and also shows how to inject hexadecimal to represent string values.
