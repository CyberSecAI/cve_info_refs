Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-17093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in `wp-includes/general-template.php` where the `lang` attribute of an HTML element is not properly sanitized. Specifically, the language setting of a site is directly inserted into the `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization of the `lang` attribute allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through the language setting of a WordPress site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page on the vulnerable WordPress site. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited via the language setting of a WordPress site. An attacker would need to somehow manipulate the language settings to include malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to change the language settings of a WordPress site or inject the malicious code into the `lang` attribute through other means. This may include:
    - Having administrative access to the WordPress site.
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities in WordPress or plugins to inject malicious language settings.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involves using `esc_attr()` to escape the `lang` attribute before it is output to prevent XSS attacks. The fix was implemented in WordPress version 4.9.1
- The `newbloguser` key issue and other vulnerabilities mentioned in the provided texts (CVE-2017-17091, CVE-2017-17092, and CVE-2017-17094) are separate vulnerabilities.
