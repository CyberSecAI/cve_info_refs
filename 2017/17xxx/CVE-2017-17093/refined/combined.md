Debian Bug     : 862816 883314 880528

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform SQL injections and
various Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) and Server-Side Request Forgery
(SSRF) attacks, as well as bypass some access restrictions.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u16.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7.5+dfsg-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:

                 CVE-2017-17094
Debian Bug     : 883314

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging
tool. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues.

CVE-2017-17091

    wp-admin/user-new.php in WordPress sets the newbloguser
    key to a string that can be directly derived from the user ID, which
    allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by
    entering this string.

CVE-2017-17092

    wp-includes/functions.php in WordPress does not require the
    unfiltered_html capability for upload of .js files, which might
    allow remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via a crafted file.

CVE-2017-17093

    wp-includes/general-template.php in WordPress does not properly
    restrict the lang attribute of an HTML element, which might allow
    attackers to conduct XSS attacks via the language setting of a site.

CVE-2017-17094

    wp-includes/feed.php in WordPress does not properly
    restrict enclosures in RSS and Atom fields, which might allow
    attackers to conduct XSS attacks via a crafted URL.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb7u20.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

# WordPress 4.9.1 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 4.9.1 is now available. This is a **security and maintenance release** for all versions since WordPress 3.7. We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

WordPress versions 4.9 and earlier are affected by four security issues which could potentially be exploited as part of a multi-vector attack. As part of the core team's ongoing commitment to security hardening, the following fixes have been implemented in 4.9.1:

1. Use a properly generated hash for the `newbloguser` key instead of a determinate substring.
2. Add escaping to the language attributes used on `html` elements.
3. Ensure the attributes of enclosures are correctly escaped in RSS and Atom feeds.
4. Remove the ability to upload JavaScript files for users who do not have the `unfiltered_html` capability.

Thank you to the reporters of these issues for practicing [responsible security disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/): [Rahul Pratap Singh](https://twitter.com/0x62626262) and John Blackbourn.

Eleven other bugs were fixed in WordPress 4.9.1. Particularly of note were:

* Issues relating to the caching of theme template files.
* A MediaElement JavaScript error preventing users of certain languages from being able to upload media files.
* The inability to edit theme and plugin files on Windows based servers.

[This post has more information about all of the issues fixed in 4.9.1 if you'd like to learn more](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/11/28/wordpress-4-9-1-scheduled-for-november-29th/).

[Download WordPress 4.9.1](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and click "Update Now." Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update automatically.
