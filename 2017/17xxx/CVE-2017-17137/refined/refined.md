- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An Out-of-Bounds memory access vulnerability exists in the PEM module due to insufficient verification of input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local attacker can cause a processing crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker places a malicious certificate into the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user with the ability to place a malicious certificate on the system.
