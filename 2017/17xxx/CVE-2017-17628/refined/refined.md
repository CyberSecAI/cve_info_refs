Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `tbud` parameter of the `property-list` page in Responsive Realestate Script version 3.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `tbud` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The exploit PoC demonstrates both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially read sensitive database information, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `property-list` page.
*   The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `tbud` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned, suggesting that the vulnerability is likely exploitable by unauthenticated users.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of SQL injection techniques and how to craft appropriate payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit PoC demonstrates how to inject SQL code into the `tbud` parameter. Example payloads include:
    *   `tbud=5001-10000 AND 4719=4719&quicksrch1=` (boolean-based blind)
    *   `tbud=5001-10000 AND SLEEP(5)&quicksrch1=` (time-based blind)

*   The PoC also mentions that 34 columns are injectable.
