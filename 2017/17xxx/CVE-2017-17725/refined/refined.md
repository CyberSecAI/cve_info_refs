Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17725

**Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the `Exiv2::getULong` function within the `types.cpp` file of the Exiv2 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when the program writes data beyond the allocated buffer in heap memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash, as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer error.
- Potentially, if a malicious actor crafts a specific input, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. This requires advanced techniques, and it is not explicitly stated, but can be an impact for this type of bug.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted TIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIFF file as input to the Exiv2 library.
- No special privileges or specific network position are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `Exiv2::getULong` function (src/types.cpp, line 246).
- The provided AddressSanitizer output highlights the heap-buffer-overflow, indicating an out-of-bounds read. The code attempts to read 4 bytes from address 0x60200000ef73, which is outside a 5-byte allocated region [0x60200000ef70, 0x60200000ef75).
- The vulnerable code is triggered when processing a JP2 image due to a call chain that includes `Exiv2::Jp2Image::readMetadata`.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) file is provided to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is different from CVE-2017-14864, which was an invalid memory address dereference.
- The vulnerability was fixed in exiv2 version 0.27.0-1.el7_6.
- The issue was reported and fixed in the exiv2 Github repository, issue #188.
- A Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2019:2101) addresses this vulnerability.
