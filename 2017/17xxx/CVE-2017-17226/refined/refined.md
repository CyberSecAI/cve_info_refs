- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and improper configuration within the TripAdvisor app pre-installed on some Huawei mobile phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows loading of arbitrary URLs due to a lack of proper input validation and improper configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can invoke the TripAdvisor app to load a specific URL and execute malicious code contained within that URL. This could potentially lead to various attacks including but not limited to data theft, malware installation, or unauthorized access to resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application that exploits the TripAdvisor app's vulnerability. The malicious app would then invoke TripAdvisor to load a malicious URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious app. Additionally, the attacker needs to trick the user into installing this malicious app on their device which also has the vulnerable version of the TripAdvisor app installed.
