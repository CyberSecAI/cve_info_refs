| |  |  | [tc](user?id=tc) [on May 14, 2018](item?id=17066419)   | [parent](item?id=17064129) | [context](context?id=17066419) | [favorite](fave?id=17066419&auth=52b1aa2f022157f0f70fd32a7a7f8a9568008a12) | on: [EFail – Vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption t...](item?id=17064129)  Let's summarize the situation: Abstract: S/MIME and MUAs are broken. OpenPGP (with MDC) is not, but clients MUST check for GPG error codes. Use Mutt carefully or copy/paste into GPG for now. - Some mail clients concatenate all parts of a multipart message together, even joining partial HTML elements, allowing the decrypted plaintext of an OpenPGP or S/MIME encrypted part to be exfiltrated via an image tag. Mail clients shouldn't be doing this in any world, and can fix this straightforwardly. - S/MIME (RFC 5751) does not provide for authenticated encryption, so the ciphertext is trivially malleable. An attacker can use a CBC gadget to add the image tag into the ciphertext itself. We can't expect a mail client to avoid exfiltrating the plaintext in this case. S/MIME itself needs to be fixed (or abandoned). - OpenPGP (RFC 4880) provides for authenticated encryption (called "MDC", see sections 5.13 and 13.11 of the RFC) which would prevent a similar CFB-based gadget attack if enforced. GPG added this feature in 2000 or 2001. If the MDC tag is missing or invalid, GPG returns an error. If GPG is asked to write the plaintext as a file, it will refuse. When the output is directed to a pipe, it will write the output and return an error code [1]. An application such as an MUA using it in this manner must check for the error code before rendering or processing the result. It seems this requirement was not made clear enough to implementors. The mail clients need to release patches to check for this error. This will create an incompatibility with broken OpenPGP implementations that have not yet implemented MDC. - Even without clients enforcing or checking the authentication tag, it's a bit trickier to pull off the attack against OpenPGP because the plaintext may be compressed before encryption. The authors were still able to pull it off a reasonable percentage of the time. Section 14 of RFC 4880 actually describes a much earlier attack which was complicated in this same manner; it caused the OpenPGP authors to declare decompression errors as security errors. Net-net, using encrypted email with Mutt is safe [2, Table 4], though even there, opening HTML parts encrypted with S/MIME in a browser is not, and double-checking how it handles GPG errors would be prudent before forking a browser on any OpenPGP encrypted parts. See the paper for other unaffected clients, including Claws (as noted below) and K-9 Mail (which does not support S/MIME). Otherwise, it's probably best to copy and paste into GPG (check the error code or ask it to write to a file) until this is worked out. [1] [https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2018-May/06031...](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2018-May/060315.html) [2] <https://efail.de/efail-attack-paper.pdf> | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [jwildeboer](user?id=jwildeboer) [on May 14, 2018](item?id=17069422)   | [next](#17066951) [–]  “If GPG is asked to write the plaintext as a file, it will refuse. When the output is directed to a pipe, it will write the output and return an error code” I honestly don’t care about the rationale, but this inconsistent behaviour is simply wrong. After 18 years of discussion, end this. Whenever DECRYPTION\_FAIL occurs, there MUST be no decrypted content. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [dfabulich](user?id=dfabulich) [on May 14, 2018](item?id=17069716)   | [parent](#17069422) | [next](#17066951) [–]  That's not really compatible with piped output. The encrypted message can't be authenticated until it has been completely processed, but the whole point of piping is to output bytes as soon as they're available. Perhaps the moral of this story is to disable GPG's pipe feature? But it's a legitimate and significant performance improvement for authentic messages. You "just" have to remember to check the error code and it's fine/safe. Perhaps that's just too much to ask. Maybe we just can't have fast streaming decryption because it's too hard for client developers to use safely. But that point of view is at least not obvious. (On the other hand, what were you planning to do with the piped output in the first place? Probably render it, right? If GPG clients stream unauthenticated bytes into a high-performance HTML renderer, the result will surely be efail.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on May 14, 2018](item?id=17070307)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17069716) | [next](#17070205) [–]  That is *not* the whole point of piping, and the default behavior of GPG should be to buffer, validate the MDC, and release plaintext only after it's been authenticated. Pipes are a standardized Unix interface between processes, not a solemn pledge to deliver bytes as quickly as possible. If pipes had the connotation you claim they do, *it would never be safe to pipe ciphertext*, because the whole goal of modern AEAD cryptography is never to release unauthenticated plaintext to callers. Clients encrypting whole ISO images should expect that decryption will require a non-default flag. Ideally, GPG would do two-pass decryption, first checking the MDC and then decrypting. Either way, the vast, commanding majority of all messages GPG ever processes --- in fact, that the PGP protocol processes --- should be buffered and checked. If you have a complaint about how unwieldy this process is, *your complaint is with the PGP protocol*. The researchers, and cryptographers in general, agree with you. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [a3\_nm](user?id=a3_nm) [on May 15, 2018](item?id=17073384)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17070307) | [next](#17070416) [–]  Is it so easy for GPG to buffer the cleartext while validating the MDC? As the cleartext may not fit in RAM, this means that GPG could need to write it to a temporary file, right? But then, if decryption is aborted messily (e.g., the machine loses power), then this means that GPG would be leaving a file with part of the cleartext behind, which has obvious security implications. You could also imagine a two-pass approach where you first verify and then decrypt, but then what about a timing attack where a process would be modifying the encrypted file between the two passes? It doesn't look so easy to solve this problem -- arguably the right way would be to change the design of the OpenPGP protocol, cf [https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/06/27/streamingencryptio...](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/06/27/streamingencryption.html) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on May 15, 2018](item?id=17074429)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17073384) | [next](#17070416) [–]  Again, the cleartext virtually always fits trivially in RAM, and when it doesn't, it can error out and require a flag to process. Yes, this is easy to fix. OpenPGP needs to change as well, but that doesn't make insecure behavior acceptable in the interim, no matter what Werner Koch thinks. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dfabulich](user?id=dfabulich) [on May 14, 2018](item?id=17070416)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17070307) | [prev](#17073384) | [next](#17070205) [–]  What *is* the point of piping, in your view? My understanding is that it's a stream of bytes with backpressure, designed specifically to minimize buffering (by pausing output when downstream receivers are full/busy). > If pipes had the connotation you claim they do, *it would never be safe to pipe ciphertext,* because the whole goal of modern AEAD cryptography is never to release unauthenticated plaintext to callers. You say that like it's a reductio ad absurdum, but I think that's essentially right; you can't do backpressure with unauthenticated ciphertext. You have to buffer the entire output to be sure that it's safe for further processing. Thus, if you want to buffer the entire output, don't use a pipe; ask the tool to generate a file, and then read the file only when the process says that the file is done and correct. (I'd say that's a lot more wieldy than two-pass decryption.) Based on your other remarks about PGP, (nuke it from orbit) I'm not sure you have any constructive remarks to make on how to improve GPG, but I guess making it two-pass by default (with a --dangerous-single-pass flag) would be an improvement. For normal size emails, users probably wouldn't notice the performance cost of the second pass, and clients who care about performance at that level can opt into single-pass decryption and just promise to check the error code. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tedunangst](user?id=tedunangst) [on May 15, 2018](item?id=17071112)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17070416) | [next](#17070428) [–]  You know sort works with pipes, right? It doesn't squirt out mostly sorted output whenever it feels like it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on May 14, 2018](item?id=17070428)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17070416) | [prev](#17071112) | [next](#17072877) [–]  Backpressure is a *feature* of Unix pipes. It isn't their raison d'être. I don't care how you implement it, but any claim that you can't check the MDC in GPG because it's a piped interface is obviously false. GPG can, like any number of Unix utilities, some casually written and some carefully written, simply buffer the data, process it, and write it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dfabulich](user?id=dfabulich) [on May 15, 2018](item?id=17070533)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17070428) | [next](#17072877) [–]  Nobody said "you can't check the MDC." Everybody said "you have to check GPG's error code." And I think it's clear to everybody (in this thread) that GPG's approach is a dangerous blame-the-user approach to API design, even granting that this dangerous approach offers optimum performance (especially relative to adding an entire second pass). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on May 15, 2018](item?id=17070611)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17070533) | [next](#17072877) [–]  There's no difference. You're talking about the program, I'm talking about the mechanism. Either way: \* GPG should never release unauthenticated plaintext to callers. The exit code is a red herring. \* Nothing about "pipes" prevents them from squelching unauthenticated plaintext. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JdeBP](user?id=JdeBP) [on May 15, 2018](item?id=17072877)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17070416) | [prev](#17070428) | [next](#17070205) [–]  You are getting your concepts confused. Pipes are one thing, but the concept at hand is in fact *filters*, programs that primarily read data from their standard inputs and write other (processed) data to their standard outputs. What pipes involve is a red herring, because filters do not necessitate pipes. *Filters* have no requirements that they write output whilst there is still input to be read, and several well-known filter programs indeed do not do that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [loup-vaillant](user?id=loup-vaillant) [on May 14, 2018](item?id=17070205)   | [root](#17069422) | [parent](#17069716) | [prev](#17070307) | [next](#17072766) [–]  This is why I initially hesitated to implement a streaming interface for my crypto library¹ (authenticated encryption and signatures). I eventually did it, but felt compelled to sprinkle the manual with warnings about how streaming interfaces encourage the processing of unauthenticated messages. Now that we have a vulnerability with a name, I think I can make those warning even scarier. I'll update that manual.

According to [1], Claws Mail is also unaffected. I don't know if it was tested with or without its HTML plugin, but this should make no difference as long as the plugin is not configured to access remote resources. (By default it can not make network requests.)

And according to Robert J. Hansen:[0] > By default, GnuPG will scream bloody murder if a message lacks an MDC or if the MDC is invalid. At that point it's up to your email client to pay attention to the warning and do the right thing. Enigmail 2.0 and later are fine, but I can't speak for other systems. So if you use Enigmail, do make sure that you're not at v1.99. Just get the add-on in Thunderbird.

There's more in that thread. Enigmail >v2 can be forced to decrypt with MDC missing.[1] And this is a gpg bug:[2] > ... and Patrick, moving faster than the speed of light, already has the bug triaged and bounced back.

1. My thoughts about Efail are a bit more nuanced.
3. First off, the real story here is the insecurity of S/MIME. That protocol is used by a huge number of firms handling confidential and classified email. The fact that this protocol — and Microsoft Outlook — are broken is a really big deal. There have been several breaches of defense contractors here in the US, and I’m sure that similar hacks have occurred in Europe. It’s a very big problem that our “main” corporate encrypted email protocol is this weak.
5. Regarding PGP:
7. In general, I think it’s much more useful to look at the overall security of a system, rather than trying to assign blame to different components. The PGP “community”, by which I mean a collection of open source developers on GnuPG and other client projects, have spent a lot of time trying to assign blame. This isn’t very interesting to me.
9. The fact of the matter is that Efail is a very serious bug that occurs across a large number of different email clients. It enables total decryption of email messages, something that absolutely should not be possible in 2018. Even worse, the flaws that cause Efail have been well known since at least 2000-2001. The fact that this is occurring in so many different email clients indicates, to me, that the PGP tool development community is not pursuing cryptographic security to the extent required of a serious encryption tool.
11. Rather than ask “who to blame”, I’d say: ask \*why\* this is occurring.
13. The answer, it seems to me, is that nobody is really \*leading\* the PGP community in any way. Leadership in this sense means somebody who is in a position of influence, who works on various projects, and who uses and communicates with other developers in the space. This person would be aware when clients are doing things improperly, and would say something about it. If possible they would modify their own tools to ensure that third party clients can’t misuse them. Other open source encryption projects like TLS have the IETF and a handful of strong experts in corporate positions. PGP doesn’t really have anything comparable.
15. A natural location for this kind of leadership would be the GnuPG project, which is a tool that most of these systems use. But the managers of the GnuPG project have mostly decided that this is somebody else’s problem. And they’ve made that clear in the way they responded to Efail.
17. In the absence of clear security leadership, my view is: take very good care using this ecosystem. Because unless you’ve extensively reviewed all of the tools that you’re using, you can’t be sure that they will interact safely together, since nobody else is checking their work. And even if \*you\* get everything right, you’re not safe unless you make sure that all of your communication partners are also using safe toolchains. In my opinion, this is very hard to get right. And so — until this changes substantially -- I wouldn’t trust the PGP ecosystem for extremely sensitive communications.

# EFAIL

* [Mitigations](#mitigations)
* [FAQ](#faq)
* [Paper/Talks](#paper)
* [Coverage](#press)

**EFAIL describes vulnerabilities in the end-to-end encryption technologies OpenPGP and S/MIME that leak the plaintext of encrypted emails.**

Email is a plaintext communication medium whose communication paths are partly protected by TLS ([TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)). For people in hostile environments (journalists, political activists, whistleblowers, ...) who depend on the confidentiality of digital communication, this may not be enough. Powerful attackers such as nation state agencies are known to eavesdrop on email communications of a large number of people. To address this, [OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) offers [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) specifically for sensitive communication in view of these powerful attackers. [S/MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME) is an alternative standard for email end-to-end encryption that is typically used to secure corporate email communication.

![](media/img/overview1.jpg)

The EFAIL attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards to reveal the plaintext of encrypted emails. In a nutshell, EFAIL abuses active content of HTML emails, for example externally loaded images or styles, to exfiltrate plaintext through requested URLs. To create these exfiltration channels, the attacker first needs access to the encrypted emails, for example, by eavesdropping on network traffic, compromising email accounts, email servers, backup systems or client computers. The emails could even have been collected years ago.

![](media/img/overview2.jpg)

The attacker changes an encrypted email in a particular way and sends this changed encrypted email to the victim. The victim's email client decrypts the email and loads any external content, thus exfiltrating the plaintext to the attacker.

#### The CBC/CFB Gadget Attack

There are two different flavors of EFAIL attacks. First, we describe the novel *CBC/CFB gadget* attacks which abuse vulnerabilities in the specification of OpenPGP and S/MIME to exfiltrate the plaintext. The diagram below describes the idea of CBC gadgets in S/MIME. Because of the specifics of the [CBC mode of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation), an attacker can precisely modify plaintext blocks if she knows the plaintext. S/MIME encrypted emails usually start with "Content-type: multipart/signed" so the attacker knows at least one full block of plaintext as shown in *(a)*. She can then form a *canonical plaintext block* whose content is all zeros as shown in (b). We call the block pair *X* and *C0* a CBC gadget. In step (c), she then repeatedly appends CBC gadgets to inject an image tag into the encrypted plaintext. This creates a single encrypted body part that exfiltrates its own plaintext when the user opens the attacker email. OpenPGP uses the [CFB mode of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Feedback_.28CFB.29), which has very similar cryptographic properties as CBC and allows the same attack using CFB gadgets.

![](media/img/smime-attack.png)

The difference here is that any standard-conforming client will be vulnerable and that each vendor may cook their own mitigations that may or may not prevent the attacks. Thus, in the long term, it is necessary to update the specification to find and document changes that fix the underlying root causes of the vulnerabilities.

While the CBC/CFB gadget attacks on PGP and S/MIME are technically very similar, the requirements for a successful attack differ substantially. Attacking S/MIME is straightforward and an attacker can break multiple (in our tests up to 500) S/MIME encrypted emails by sending a single crafted S/MIME email to the victim. As opposed to S/MIME, modern OpenPGP implementations offer a Modification Detection Code (MDC) that can detect modified plaintexts, effectively preventing the CFB gadget attack. However, we found that several clients only gave a warning to the user for invalid MDCs, but still displayed the modified plaintext. This allowed the CFB gadget attack despite the MDC. Furthermore, PGP compresses the plaintext before encrypting it, which complicates guessing known plaintext bytes. Given the current state of our research, the CFB gadget attack against PGP only has a success rate of approximately one in three attempts. We feel that plaintext compression is not a fundamental limitation of the EFAIL attacks but more a technical hitch and that attacks become more efficient in future research.

#### Direct Exfiltration

![](media/img/exfil1.png)

Second, the *direct exfiltration* attack abuses vulnerabilities in Apple Mail, iOS Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird to directly exfiltrate the plaintext of encrypted emails. These vulnerabilities can be fixed in the respective email clients. The attack works like this. The attacker creates a new multipart email with three body parts as shown below. The first is an HTML body part essentially containing an HTML image tag. Note that the src attribute of that image tag is opened with quotes but not closed. The second body part contains the PGP or S/MIME ciphertext. The third is an HTML body part again that closes the src attribute of the first body part.

![](media/img/exfil2.png)

The attacker now sends this email to the victim. The victim's client decrypts the encrypted second body part and stitches the three body parts together in one HTML email as shown below. Note that the src attribute of the image tag in line 1 is closed in line 4, so the URL spans over all four lines.

![](media/img/exfil3.png)

The email client then URL encodes all non-printable characters (e.g., %20 is a whitespace) and requests an image from that URL. As the path of the URL contains the plaintext of the encrypted email, the victim's email client sends the plaintext to the attacker.

The direct exfiltration EFAIL attacks work for encrypted PGP as well as S/MIME emails.

## Mitigations

Here are some strategies to prevent EFAIL attacks:

**Short term: No decryption in email client.** The best way to prevent EFAIL attacks is to only decrypt S/MIME or PGP emails in a separate application outside of your email client. Start by removing your S/MIME and PGP private keys from your email client, then decrypt incoming encrypted emails by copy&pasting the ciphertext into a separate application that does the decryption for you. That way, the email clients cannot open exfiltration channels. This is currently the safest option with the downside that the process gets more involved.

**Short term: Disable HTML rendering.** The EFAIL attacks abuse active content, mostly in the form of HTML images, styles, etc. Disabling the presentation of *incoming* HTML emails in your email client will close the most prominent way of attacking EFAIL. Note that there are other possible backchannels in email clients which are not related to HTML but these are more difficult to exploit.

**Medium term: Patching.** Some vendors will publish patches that either fix the EFAIL vulnerabilities or make them much harder to exploit.

**Long term: Update OpenPGP and S/MIME standards.** The EFAIL attacks exploit flaws and undefined behavior in the [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME), S/MIME, and OpenPGP standards. Therefore, the standards need to be updated, which will take some time.
**Update:** The changes in the current draft of [OpenPGP RFC4880 (bis05)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05) reflect our recommendation to [deprecate the SE packet type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05#section-5.8) and that [modified ciphertexts should not be displayed](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05#page-104).

#### What is PGP and S/MIME encryption?

Both technologies add an additional layer of security to your email communication. If used properly, both technologies should guarantee confidentiality and authenticity of your email messages even if an attacker has full access to your email account. The EFAIL attacks break this additional encryption layer.

#### What are the EFAIL attacks?

The EFAIL attacks break PGP and S/MIME email encryption by coercing clients into sending the full plaintext of the emails to the attacker.

#### Are there CVEs for EFAIL?

Yes, there are two official CVE nummers for the CBC/CFB gadget attacks:

CVE-2017-17688: OpenPGP CFB gadget attacks

CVE-2017-17689: S/MIME CBC gadget attacks

Different vendors assigned further CVEs for specific security issues relevant to EFAIL, for example, direct exfiltration attacks.

#### Who is affected?

Journalists, political activists or whistleblowers use an additional encryption layer, often PGP, because they fear that someone gets access to their email communication. The EFAIL attacks can be used to break this additional encryption layer. This leads to the situation where anyone getting access to their email communication can also read the victims emails even if they use additional PGP encryption. The same attacks apply to S/MIME which is typically used in enterprise infrastructures.

#### Can you read my emails?

No. The EFAIL attacks require the attacker to have access to your S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails. You are thus only affected if an attacker already has access to your emails. However, the very goal of PGP or S/MIME encryption is the protection against this kind of attacker. For those users who rely on PGP and S/MIME encryption, the EFAIL attacks may be a big deal!

#### But my emails are TLS encrypted!

TLS is a transport layer encryption technology that encrypts network traffic among email clients and email servers, or between two email servers. However, the emails are processed and stored in plaintext on the servers and in the email accounts. Any attacker getting access to these emails, either via compromising an email account or an email server, can read and change these emails. PGP and S/MIME are used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of emails in case an attacker can already access the emails.

#### Is my email client affected?

Our analysis shows that EFAIL plaintext exfiltration channels exist for 25 of the 35 tested S/MIME email clients and 10 of the 28 tested OpenPGP email clients. While it is necessary to change the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards to reliably fix these vulnerabilities, Apple Mail, iOS Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird had even more severe implementation flaws allowing direct exfiltration of the plaintext that is technically very easy to execute.

#### Can I find out whether I have already been attacked?

Not for sure. You can of course search in your inbox for malicious emails indicating EFAIL attacks. A strong indication for these attacks could be, for example, malformed emails with unclosed img tags followed by encrypted content, or encrypted content that exfiltrates the plaintext to foreign URLs. However, note that emails are encrypted with the keys of sender as well as all receivers. The attacker can target any of these parties to exfiltrate content that is important to you. In advanced attack scenarios where the attacker is in control of the email server, she could have deleted the malicious emails after the victim has processed them.

#### I don't send HTML emails. Am I safe?

No. The attacker can change encrypted text/only emails to HTML emails. You need to disable *viewing* HTML email to increase protection from EFAIL attacks.

#### I have disabled HTML in my email client. Am I safe now?

Depends. S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails are encrypted with the public keys of *all* recipients *and* the sender. The attacker can thus perform the EFAIL attacks if only one of the participants is vulnerable. In order to prevent the EFAIL attacks, *all* participants must use secure email clients.

#### Will signatures prevent these attacks?

No. PGP and S/MIME emails are displayed in the email program independently of whether or not they are signed or whether an existing signature is valid or not. Even if signatures did matter: an attacker can copy the altered ciphertext into a separate email and create a valid signature under his own name.

#### Can you decrypt my own encrypted emails when I lost my private key?

No. The EFAIL attacks target a victim, who is in possession of the private key and who decrypts our prepared emails in an email client. If the private key is lost, the EFAIL attacks won't help recovering encrypted messages.

#### Do I need to revoke my certificate or public key?

No. Using the EFAIL attacks, the attacker can retrieve the plaintext of encrypted OpenPGP and S/MIME messages. She does not get direct access to the private key.

#### I have encrypted data using OpenPGP or S/MIME and I won't decrypt it in the email context. Am I safe?

For now yes. There may be edge cases though that we hadn't looked into. For example, if you encrypted a directory with sensitive files, an attacker could change these encrypted files to contain false information or even malware. If a victim decrypts the directory and opens any of the files, malware or even just an HTML file could be used to exfiltrate plaintext or even compromise the system.

#### What happens if there are quotes in the encrypted email?

Quotes in the plaintext might end the URL that is used to exfiltrate the plaintext so that either the bytes after the quote are not exfiltrated or that the exploit may not work at all. Because of the properties of the CBC and CFB modes of operation, an attacker can split a single S/MIME or PGP ciphertext into multiple parts and exfiltrate each independently with separate HTML tags (but still in one email). If one part contains quotes then only the residual plaintext bytes in that part are missing. There is a whole zoo of techniques that the attacker can use to exfiltrate the full plaintext despite these technical obstacles.

#### Will SPF/DKIM/DMARC mitigate the EFAIL attacks? (Update 2018-05-16)

No. These technologies offer message authenticity and protection against email sender spoofing. Our EFAIL attacker would copy the S/MIME or PGP ciphertext from the original email and past the changed ciphertext into a new message. The attacker now sends the message under his own name with valid values for SPF/DKIM/DMARC.

#### How did EFAIL influence the developments in the current standards?

There is an ongoing work on two new email security standards. Both considered countermeasures presented in our paper.

The [S/MIME standard draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lamps-rfc5751-bis-11) references our EFAIL paper and recommends the usage of authenticated encryption with AES-GCM. Furthermore, it warns that different parts in multipart/mixed emails should be treated as *being of different origins*.

The [OpenPGP standard draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05) deprecates Symmetrically Encrypted (SE) data packets which are not protected by MDCs. It proposes AEAD protected data packets and mentions that *the implementation should not allow users to access erroneous data*.

## Responsible Disclosure

We have responsibly disclosed our findings to the affected vendors who have applied (or are in the process of applying) countermeasures. Please note that in general these countermeasures are specific hotfixes and we cannot rule out that extended attacks with further backchannels or exfiltrations will be found. (**Update:** After the disclosure, bypasses were indeed published for [Thunderbird](https://www.golem.de/news/pgp-smime-thunderbird-update-notwendig-um-efail-zu-verhindern-1805-134472.html) and [Apple Mail](https://theintercept.com/2018/05/25/in-apple-mail-theres-no-protecting-pgp-encrypted-messages/).) Moreover, even if all backchannels are closed, both standards are still vulnerable to attacks where the attacker can modify email content or inject malicious code into attachments which get executed in a context beyond email client.

We informed German CERT and BSI about our attacks in December 2017. They forwarded all the relevant information to other CERTs and companies.

We disclosed our attacks to the GnuPG developers on the 24th of November 2017. Further clients are listed below. For reference we also include case numbers and CVEs if they have been assigned. Note that as of May 2018 fixes have been deployed for various mail clients, for details check the vendors' websites.
