Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation of a user-supplied string within the `NVBUSourceDeviceSet Get` method requests. This unchecked string is then used to construct SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before embedding it in a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the underlying database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, over the network. An attacker can send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable `NVBUSourceDeviceSet Get` method.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability and needs network access to the vulnerable service.

**Summary of Key Information:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17425
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Quest NetVault Backup
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (in the context of the database)
*   **Fix:** NVBU 11.4.5
*   **Additional Details**: Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['28751'].
