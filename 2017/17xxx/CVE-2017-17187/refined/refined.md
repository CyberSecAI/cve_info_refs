Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Integer overflow due to insufficient input validation in the processing of SOAP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Integer Overflow: The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly validate input data, allowing an attacker to craft SOAP packets that trigger an integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The integer overflow can lead to a process reset on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote Attack: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   SOAP Packets: The attack involves sending malformed SOAP packets to the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to gain authenticated access to the target device.

**Summary of relevant information:**

The advisory describes multiple vulnerabilities, including three integer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-17183, CVE-2017-17184, and CVE-2017-17187). All three have the same root cause, attack vector, and impact.

Specifically, regarding CVE-2017-17187, the document notes that a remote authenticated attacker can send specially crafted SOAP packets to a vulnerable device. This is caused by insufficient input validation, which leads to an integer overflow and can potentially cause a process reset.
