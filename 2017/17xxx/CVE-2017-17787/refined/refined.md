Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-17787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read in the `read_creator_block` function within the PSP file format importer of GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). This occurs because the code reads a string of fixed length without ensuring it is null-terminated. If a specially crafted PSP file is provided, it can trigger this read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer while processing a crafted PSP file. Specifically the length of the creator string is not properly validated.
- **Lack of null-termination check**: The code assumes that a fixed-length string will always be null-terminated, which is not guaranteed when processing external data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Application crash:**  The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the GIMP application due to the out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads are sometimes exploitable for arbitrary code execution. The provided text mentions this could happen if malformed files are opened.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious image file:** An attacker crafts a malicious PSP image file designed to trigger the vulnerability when opened by a user using GIMP.
- **User interaction:** A user must open the specially crafted file using GIMP to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create/modify a PSP image:** The attacker needs the capability to manipulate or create a malicious PSP file that can trigger the out-of-bounds read condition.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker typically needs to convince a user to open the crafted image with GIMP

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was identified via fuzzing.
- Patches were created and applied for both master and 2.8 branches. The fix involves checking that strings being read at a fixed length are properly null-terminated.
- Multiple other vulnerabilities were discovered during the same period and in the same component. This CVE is one of 6 different CVEs identified as part of a bulk fix.
- Debian Security Advisories (DSA) indicate that this issue was fixed in gimp versions 2.8.14-1+deb8u2 (jessie) and 2.8.18-1+deb9u1 (stretch).
- Ubuntu Security Notice (USN) identifies the vulnerability in Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.
