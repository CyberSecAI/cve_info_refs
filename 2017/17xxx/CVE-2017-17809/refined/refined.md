Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17809

**Root Cause:** The root cause is an unprotected XPC service in the `vyprvpnservice` launch daemon. This service allows attackers to modify the OpenVPN configuration and the arguments passed to the OpenVPN binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unprotected XPC Service:** The `vyprvpnservice` launch daemon exposes an XPC service that lacks proper access controls.
*   **Configuration Tampering:** Attackers can modify the OpenVPN configuration and command-line arguments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the OpenVPN configuration, an attacker can force the VyprVPN application to load a malicious dynamic library every time a new connection is made. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the VyprVPN application which runs with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XPC Service Manipulation:** The attacker interacts with the unprotected XPC service to alter the OpenVPN configuration and arguments.
*   **Dynamic Library Loading:** The vulnerability is exploited by forcing VyprVPN to load a malicious dynamic library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the unprotected XPC service. This implies that the attacker needs to be on the same system as the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious dynamic library.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects VyprVPN for MacOS versions prior to 2.15.0.5828.
*   The vendor, Golden Frog, has acknowledged and fixed the vulnerability.
*   An exploit is available, which is linked in the advisory.
