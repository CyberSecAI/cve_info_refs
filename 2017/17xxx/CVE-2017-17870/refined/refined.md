Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17870

**Vulnerable Software:** Joomla! Component JBuildozer

**Vulnerable Version:** 1.4.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `appid` parameter of the `com_jbuildozer` component's `entriessearch` view. It's vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data from the Joomla! website's database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to gain administrative privileges on the system.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could potentially alter the content of the website.
- **Denial of Service:** Malicious SQL queries could also lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is executed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component.
- **`appid` Parameter:** The SQL injection payload is placed within the `appid` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla! website.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The provided exploit does not seem to require authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses SQL injection techniques to extract the database version (`@@version`) and the name of the exploit author. This is a common practice to demonstrate successful injection. The payload utilizes MySQL specific syntax such as `extractvalue` and `concat` to achieve this.
-  The provided exploit example is:
   ```
   http://server/index.php?option=com_jbuildozer&view=entriessearch&tmpl=component&mode=module&tpl=3&appid=1%20%20%2f*!05555Procedure*%2f%20%2f*!05555Analyse*%2f%20%28extractvalue(0%2c%2f*!05555concat*%2f%280x27,0x496873616e2053656e63616e,0x3a,@@version%29%29,0%29%2d%2d%20%2d
   ```
- The exploit string is URL encoded, demonstrating how it might be sent through a browser or other web client.
