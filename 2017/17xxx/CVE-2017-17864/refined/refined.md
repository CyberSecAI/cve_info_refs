Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-17864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) verifier in the Linux kernel could fail to detect pointer leaks from conditional code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of pointer data values within the BPF verifier.
- Failure to detect pointer leaks specifically in conditional code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information, potentially kernel memory.
- This information could then be used to exploit other vulnerabilities present in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system to run crafted BPF programs.
