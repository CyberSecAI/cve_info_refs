- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of packets after a signal tone or language package is uploaded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote code execution due to lack of proper validation of uploaded data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker, authenticated as a common user, can upload a malicious signal tone or language package, then craft and send malicious packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be authenticated as a common user and have network access to the affected system.
