```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of template paths in `include/inc_archives_view.php` and the ability to manipulate the template path stored in the add-on table via SQL injection in `member/article_edit.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection in `member/article_edit.php` allowing modification of the add-on table's template path.",
    "Lack of sanitization of the template path in `include/inc_archives_view.php` which leads to arbitrary code execution by including attacker controlled template files.",
     "Insecure handling of user-provided input `$dede_addonfields` within `member/article_edit.php` leading to SQL injection."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to create a webshell on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can upload a malicious template file through the user interface, then exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in `member/article_edit.php` to modify the template path in the add-on table. When the modified article is viewed, the application includes and executes the malicious template file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs a valid user account with the ability to upload files and create/edit articles. The attacker also needs the ability to craft a specific POST request to trigger the SQL injection."
