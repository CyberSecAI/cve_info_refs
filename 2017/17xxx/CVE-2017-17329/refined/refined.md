Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak issue that occurs when the affected Huawei products parse XML Schema data. Specifically, the software fails to properly release allocated memory during this process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper memory management. The software does not free memory allocated when parsing XML Schema data. This leads to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the system service to become abnormal due to memory exhaustion, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated attacker can upload a specially crafted XML file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid login credentials to access the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload the crafted XML file.
