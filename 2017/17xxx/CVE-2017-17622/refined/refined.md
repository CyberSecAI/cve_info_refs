Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `exams.php` file of the "Online Exam Test Application Script 1.6." The `sort` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `sort` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input passed to the `sort` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** Malicious SQL queries can be used to alter data within the database, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
- **Data Deletion:** Attackers can delete critical data.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can lead to the ability to execute arbitrary code on the database server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the server and application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `sort` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the `exams.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic knowledge of SQL in order to craft the injection payloads and understand the structure of the database.
- **Web Application Knowledge:** Some knowledge of how web applications work will be beneficial in finding the vulnerable parameter and testing it.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit details show the following payloads:
   - `http://localhost/[PATH]/exams.php?sort=[SQL]`
   - `-4++UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,2,3,(SELECT(@x)FROM(SELECT(@x:=0x00),(@NR:=0),(SELECT(0)FROM(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES)WHERE(TABLE_SCHEMA!=0x696e666f726d6174696f6e5f736368656d61)AND(0x00)IN(@x:=CONCAT(@x,LPAD(@NR:=@NR%2b1,4,0x30),0x3a20,table_name,0x3c62723e))))x),5,6--+-`
   - `http://server/exams.php?sort=-4++UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,2,3,(SELECT(@x)FROM(SELECT(@x:=0x00),(@NR:=0),(SELECT(0)FROM(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES)WHERE(TABLE_SCHEMA!=0x696e666f726d6174696f6e5f736368656d61)AND(0x00)IN(@x:=CONCAT(@x,LPAD(@NR:=@NR%2b1,4,0x30),0x3a20,table_name,0x3c62723e))))x),5,6--+-`
   - `sort=4 AND 9300=9300`
   - `sort=4 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(0x717a6b7071,0x436a5574724b7477565147546d496b47534c4e586c4275794c6359695374477874484b4669767978,0x7176627871),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- Knya`
These payloads demonstrate how an attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve data or manipulate the database by exploiting the `sort` parameter.
