Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a blind XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw found in the Episerver blog module. This means that the application processes external XML entities without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to potentially include external files in the XML processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Blind XXE:** The primary vulnerability is a blind XXE injection. The "blind" aspect indicates that the attacker does not receive the extracted data directly in the response.
- **XML Processing:** The application's XML parser is not configured to prevent external entity inclusion, which is the core weakness leading to the exploit.
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:** The specific vulnerable endpoint is `/util/xmlrpc/Handler.ashx`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **File Exfiltration:** The attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem via the XXE vulnerability. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code, `episploit.py`, is designed to demonstrate this, specifically targeting `c:/windows/win.ini` as an example.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although not the main focus of the provided exploit, the article mentions that XXE vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other techniques to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). The blog post refers to another article demonstrating how this can be achieved with C#.
- **Information Disclosure:** By being able to read files on the server, attackers can gain access to sensitive information.
- **DNS Exfiltration:** It is also possible to detect if a server is vulnerable by observing DNS queries, similar to how Burp Suite Collaborator does.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious XML Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious XML payload that includes an external entity definition. This payload is sent to the vulnerable endpoint `/util/xmlrpc/Handler.ashx`.
- **External DTD Hosting:** The exploit requires the attacker to host a malicious DTD (Document Type Definition) file on a server they control. This DTD file instructs the vulnerable server to retrieve and process an external file and send its contents back to the attacker's server using HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Episerver instance and host a publicly accessible DTD file on a server under their control.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific vulnerable endpoint, `/util/xmlrpc/Handler.ashx`, in the Episerver installation.
- **Understanding of XML and DTD:** The attacker needs some knowledge about XML and DTDs to craft the exploit.
- **Publicly Accessible Server:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible server to host the malicious DTD file and receive the exfiltrated data.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is identified internally at Episerver as bug #128556.
- The fix is available from Episerver 7-patch 5.
- The PoC `episploit.py` is available on GitHub Gist and demonstrates the vulnerability by reading an arbitrary file (`c:/windows/win.ini` by default) from the server.
- The exploit sends a crafted XML payload to `/util/xmlrpc/Handler.ashx`, referencing an attacker-controlled DTD which then triggers the file read.
- Fingerprinting is possible by accessing `/util/xmlrpc/Handler.ashx` which reveals version information. Versions `EPiServer.Blog 7.0.586 EPiServer.XmlRpc 7.0.586` and lower are considered vulnerable.
- Mitigation steps include blocking all calls to `/util/xmlrpc` paths, blocking outbound webserver traffic, DNS requests and upgrading Episerver.
