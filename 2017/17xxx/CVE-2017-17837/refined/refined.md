Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `WindowIdHtmlRenderer.java` file in the Apache DeltaSpike project. Specifically, the `windowId` was not properly escaped before being included in the HTML output within a JavaScript context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The `windowId` is directly inserted into the Javascript code without sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that could perform actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Modifying the displayed content of the page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, if logged in.
- **Complete Compromise:** In a severe case, this could lead to complete compromise of the user's session and potentially even the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious `windowId` value and induce the victim to visit a crafted link containing the malicious `windowId`.
- **URL Injection:** The `windowId` appears to be a request parameter that's being reflected in the page. This makes it feasible for an attacker to inject a malicious window ID in the URL.
- **Browser-side Execution:** The injected JavaScript will be executed within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know that the application is vulnerable to XSS via the `windowId` parameter.
- **Ability to Generate a Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `windowId` parameter and trick the victim into accessing this malicious URL.

**Additional Details**
- The issue was considered a blocker and was fixed in version 1.8.1.
- The proof of concept `dswid='~~open()~~'` shows a simple injection of JavaScript code, demonstrating the XSS.
- The fix in the commit `4e25023` replaces the `writer.write(windowId)` with `writer.writeText(windowId, null);` to correctly encode/escape the `windowId`.
