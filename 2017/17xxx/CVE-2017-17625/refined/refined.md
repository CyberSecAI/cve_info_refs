Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17625:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `service-list` endpoint of the Professional Service Script 1.0 application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `city` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection via the `city` parameter in the `service-list` endpoint. This allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Database compromise: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
- Potential for further attacks:  Successful SQL injection can lead to more serious attacks such as data manipulation, arbitrary code execution on the server, or denial of service, depending on the database system and its configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `service-list` endpoint.
- Parameter Injection: The malicious SQL payload is injected through the `city` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection: The attacker needs some understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.
- No authentication is needed. The vulnerability is present in a public facing endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided proof of concept uses a `UNION SELECT` query to extract database information such as the current user, database name and database version.
- The exploit-db entry provides the vulnerable software's name, version, vendor, and a link to download the application.
- The specific dork used to find the vulnerable application is not specified.
