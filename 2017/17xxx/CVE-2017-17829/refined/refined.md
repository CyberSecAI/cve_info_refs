The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in a "Bus Booking Script" application. These include SQL injection, reflected and stored cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

**SQL Injection:**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient input sanitization when processing `sp_id` and `memid` parameters in `view_seatseller.php` and `view_member.php` respectively.
*   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input being directly included in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including database user information and version details.
*   **Attack vector:** Manipulating `sp_id` and `memid` URL parameters to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** No special capabilities are required; simply manipulating the URL.

**Reflected XSS:**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not sanitize the `datepicker` parameter in `results.php`.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected XSS vulnerability allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript code via the `datepicker` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code via the `datepicker` URL parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** No special capabilities are required; simply manipulating the URL.

**Stored XSS:**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not sanitize input parameters like `spemail` when creating a new master record in the `new_master.php` form, allowing the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript.
*   **Weakness:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization in the POST request parameters when creating a new master record.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser of users viewing the stored data, allowing for potential session hijacking or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vector:** Submitting a crafted POST request to the `new_master.php` page with malicious JavaScript code within fields like `spemail`.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** No special capabilities are required; simply crafting a malicious POST request. This is coupled with the CSRF vulnerability.

**CSRF:**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection on the `new_master.php` form which allows for forging requests.
*   **Weakness:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to perform state changing requests via a user's browser, without their knowledge.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions, such as adding a new master record with malicious content by including stored XSS payloads.
*   **Attack vector:** Creating a malicious web page that automatically submits the vulnerable `new_master.php` form with attacker-controlled data using a form submission.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious site.
