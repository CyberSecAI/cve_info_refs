Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-17523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `lilypond-invoke-editor` script in LilyPond versions up to 2.19.80 does not properly sanitize or validate the input URL string before passing it to the system's web browser (defined by the `BROWSER` environment variable).
- The script uses the `system` command which is vulnerable to argument injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Argument Injection:** The primary vulnerability is argument injection. An attacker can embed malicious arguments within the crafted URL, which are then passed to the browser as command-line arguments.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The script fails to validate the URL for potentially harmful characters or command options, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting command-line arguments, attackers can potentially control the browser's behavior, load malicious content, bypass security restrictions or even execute arbitrary commands.
- **Proxy Manipulation:** The provided example shows that an attacker can inject `--proxy-pac-file` argument to force the browser to use a malicious proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file, potentially intercepting and manipulating browser traffic.
- **Other Browser Options:** Attackers can inject other browser arguments for malicious purposes

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious browser arguments.
- **BROWSER Environment Variable:** The attack relies on the `BROWSER` environment variable being set to a vulnerable browser.
- **User Interaction:** This could be triggered via user clicking a maliciously crafted URL within a PDF viewer or other software that uses `lilypond-invoke-editor`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create or control a URL that is processed by `lilypond-invoke-editor`.
- **User Context:**  The attack needs to be executed in a context where `lilypond-invoke-editor` is used.
- **BROWSER variable set:** The user must have the BROWSER environment variable set.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported in `sensible-utils` (CVE-2017-17512) and was later found to be present in `lilypond-invoke-editor` as well. The `sensible-utils` fix involved dropping support for `%s` expansion in the `BROWSER` string, which was causing the injection.
- The fix in lilypond involved switching to `system*` instead of `system`.
- A related CVE-2018-10992 was assigned because the initial fix was incomplete. This was fixed by using `system*` instead of `system`.

In summary, CVE-2017-17523 describes an argument injection vulnerability in `lilypond-invoke-editor` due to insufficient input validation, allowing attackers to control the behavior of the launched browser by manipulating the `BROWSER` environment variable.
