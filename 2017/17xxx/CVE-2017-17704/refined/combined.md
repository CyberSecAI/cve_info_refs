# [CVE-2017-17704] Broken Cryptography in iStar Ultra & IP ACM by Software House

Reading time: 3 minutes

## Introduction

Vulnerabilities were identified in the iStar Ultra & IP-ACM boards offered by
Software House. This system is used to control physical access to resources
based on RFID-based badge readers. Badge readers interface with the IP-ACM
board, which uses TCP/IP to communicate with the iStar Ultra controller.

These were discovered during a black box assessment and therefore the
vulnerability list should not be considered exhaustive; observations suggest
that it is likely that further vulnerabilities exist. It is strongly
recommended that Software House undertake a full whitebox security assessment of
this application. Additionally, it is our suggestion that all communications be
conducted over TLS. While alternatives are suggested below, cryptography is
very difficult even for experts, and so using a well-understood cryptosystem
like TLS is preferable to home-grown solutions. The version under test was
indicated as: 6.5.2.20569. As of the time of disclosure, the issues remain
unfixed.

## Issues Found

The communications between the IP-ACM and the iStar Ultra is encrypted using a
fixed AES key and IV. Each message is encrypted in CBC mode and restarts with
the fixed IV, leading to replay attacks of entire messages. There is no
authentication of messages beyond the use of the fixed AES key, so message
forgery is also possible. A working proof of concept has been demonstrated that
allows an attacker with access to the IP network used by the IP-ACM and iStar
Ultra to unlock doors connected to the IP-ACM. (This PoC will not be disclosed
at this time, due to the issue remaining unfixed.)

## Impact & Workaround

An attacker with access to the network can unlock doors without generating any
log entry of the door unlock. An attacker can also prevent legitimate unlock
attempts. Organizations using these devices should ensure that the network used
for IP-ACM to iStar Ultra communications is not accessible to potential
attackers.

## Timeline

* 2017/07/01-2017/07/14 - Issues discovered
* 2017/07/19 - Issues disclosed to Software House
* 2017/08/29 - Issues acknowledged & proposed fixes discussed. Informed that
  current hardware could not be fixed and fixes would only apply to new
  products.
* 2017/10/19 - 90 day window elapsed in accordance with disclosure policy.
* 2017/12/18 - Public disclosure.
