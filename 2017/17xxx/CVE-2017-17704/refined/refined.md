Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-17704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of cryptography in communications between the iStar Ultra and IP-ACM boards by Software House.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Fixed AES Key and IV:** The system uses a fixed AES key and Initialization Vector (IV) for encryption. This means the same key and IV are reused for every communication.
*   **CBC Mode with Fixed IV:**  The use of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with a fixed IV leads to predictable ciphertext patterns. Because the IV is constant, identical plaintext messages will produce identical ciphertexts.
*   **Lack of Authentication:**  There's no proper message authentication beyond the use of the fixed AES key. This allows for message forgery and replay attacks.
*   **No TLS:** The communication does not use a well established cryptosystem like TLS

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Door Unlocks:** Attackers can unlock doors connected to the IP-ACM without triggering any log entries.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can prevent legitimate door unlock attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the IP network used by the IP-ACM and iStar Ultra.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable devices or have the ability to intercept and send traffic on that network.
*   **Knowledge of Protocol:** The attacker needs to know the communication protocols used between the IP-ACM and iStar Ultra.
*   **Message Capture/Forgery:** The attacker can capture legitimate messages and replay them or construct their own messages.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found during a black-box assessment, suggesting that there may be other undisclosed vulnerabilities.
*   The vendor was notified but stated the hardware is not fixable, and the fix would only be applied to future products.
*   The affected version tested was 6.5.2.20569, and the issue was still present at the time of disclosure.
*   The proof of concept was not made public due to the unfixed status of the issue.
* The discoverer of the issue was David Tomaschik of the Google Security Team.
