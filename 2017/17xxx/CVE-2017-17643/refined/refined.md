**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the FS Lynda Clone 1.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user-supplied inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
- This can lead to:
    - Information disclosure (accessing sensitive data).
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    - Potential complete compromise of the application and database.
- In the provided proof of concept, the attacker is attempting to extract the database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `keywords` parameter in the search functionality of the application. This is a web application vulnerability that an attacker can exploit using a web browser or a script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and how to construct injection payloads.
- The attacker does not appear to require any special privileges or authentication.
- The provided PoC uses a simple HTML form to demonstrate exploitation, indicating that it is easily accessible.
