The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in BMC Remedy, as reported by Outpost24.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote and Local File Inclusion:** The BIRT report engine allows inclusion of arbitrary external or internal files due to a lack of restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** System fingerprinting, internal port scanning, SSRF, or remote code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the BIRT report engine.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability through the BIRT report engine.
*  **Internal Path Disclosure:** The BIRT report engine discloses internal file paths through verbose error messages when a non-existent file is included.
    *   **Impact:** Internal path information is revealed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the BIRT report engine with non-existent file inclusion.
    *   **Attacker Capability:**  An attacker can trigger the vulnerability through the BIRT report engine.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A reflected XSS vulnerability affects both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Reflected XSS through a crafted URL or input.
    *   **Attacker Capability:**  An attacker can craft the malicious payload.
*  **Cross-Site Script Include:** Dynamically generated JavaScript, used for environmental variables, can be included by a malicious third-party to steal CSRF tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Stealing CSRF tokens.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious third-party site including the dynamically generated javascript.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker can include the javascript from a malicious website.
*   **Log Hijacking:** The remote logging of the system can be accessed by unauthenticated users, allowing for an attacker to hijack system logs.
    *   **Impact:** Access to system logs containing usernames and HTTP data including cookies.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Unauthenticated access to the remote logging functionality.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker can access the logging functionality without authentication.
*   **Session Token Disclosure:** Some HTTP responses include the session token value, allowing a Javascript to bypass the httponly flag and steal it.
    *   **Impact:** Session token theft.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Javascript can intercept session token from HTTP responses.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker can inject a javascript to intercept the session token.
*  **Authenticated Code Execution:** Authenticated users with report creation rights can achieve code execution via BIRT templating. Access to this feature appears to be granted to all users by default.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of the BIRT templating functionality.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An authenticated user with report creation access.

**Vendor Response Summary:**

*   **Remote and Local File Inclusion:** Vendor claimed issue was fixed in later versions, but this was not the case.  Existing CVE was also misclassified.
*   **Internal Path Disclosure:**  Vendor referenced a non-functional hotfix.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Acknowledged and stated it will be fixed.
*   **Cross-Site Script Include:** Acknowledged and stated they are working on it.
*   **Log Hijacking:** Acknowledged and stated access to the offending service will be removed in later versions.
*  **Session Token Disclosure:** No response.
*  **Authenticated Code Execution:** No response.
