Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17841:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ROBOT attack, which targets the TLS RSA key exchange mechanism. This attack can potentially lead to the decryption of captured TLS sessions if the vulnerable server is still active and utilizing the same private key originally used in the captured session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the susceptibility of the TLS RSA key exchange to the ROBOT attack. The vulnerability exists in PAN-OS versions that support RSA-based key exchanges in TLS, specifically when used for SSL Decryption and GlobalProtect functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt previously captured TLS sessions. This can result in a breach of confidentiality as sensitive information transmitted over these sessions can be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can potentially decrypt captured sessions if the vulnerable server (PAN-OS device in this case) is accessible and using the same private key at the time of capture and at the time of the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have captured TLS sessions from the vulnerable PAN-OS device.
- The attacker needs to possess the technical capabilities to perform the ROBOT attack, which is a specialized cryptographic attack.
- The attacker does not need any user interaction or privileges on the target system.
- The attack has a high complexity

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects PAN-OS versions 6.1.19 and earlier, 7.1.14 and earlier, and 8.0.6-h3 and earlier.
*   Palo Alto Networks released updates to address the vulnerability: PAN-OS 6.1.20, 7.1.15, and 8.0.7, and all later versions are unaffected.
*   A temporary mitigation includes disabling RSA in SSL Decryption profiles for PAN-OS 7.1 and later. Another measure would be to replace RSA based GlobalProtect server certificates with Elliptic Curve DSA based certificates.
*   Palo Alto Networks has also released content update 757, which includes a vulnerability signature ("TLS Network Security Protocol Information Disclosure Vulnerability - ROBOT", #38407), that can provide an interim mitigation. This signature needs to be applied upstream of any interfaces using SSL Decryption or hosting GlobalProtect portals/gateways.
