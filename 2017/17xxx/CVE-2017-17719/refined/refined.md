Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `wp-concours` plugin for WordPress fails to sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the `result_message` parameter from the HTTP request is directly used in the application without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code via the `result_message` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary web script execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access a vulnerable page with the crafted URL. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL. The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious payload in the `result_message` parameter and persuades a user to click on it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with a malicious `result_message` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user of the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin to click on the crafted link.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `wp-concours/includes/concours_page.php`
*   Line 18 stores the `$_REQUEST['result_message']` in `$message_str` without sanitization.
*   Line 28 echoes `$message_str` back to the user.

**Proof of Concept:**

*   The provided proof of concept URL is `http://<host>/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=concours&result_message=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`. This URL, when visited by an authenticated user will execute the embedded JavaScript, revealing the user's cookies through the browser's alert function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin was closed due to this security issue.
*   No fix was available at the time of the report
