- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries within the handling of NVBUBackupSegment Get method requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication, by sending specially crafted requests to the NVBUBackupSegment Get method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Quest NetVault Backup server. No authentication is required.
