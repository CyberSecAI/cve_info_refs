Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `pal2rgb` tool of the LibTIFF library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The `pal2rgb` tool allocates a fixed-size output buffer (225 bytes) that is too small for certain crafted TIFF images, leading to a heap overflow when writing data to the buffer.
*   The `pal2rgb` tool calculates the output buffer size using `TIFFScanlineSize(out)`, which may return an insufficient size (e.g., 225) instead of the necessary size of  3 * imagewidth for RGB data.
*   The vulnerability occurs during the conversion of a paletted image to RGB, where the pixel data is expanded to three bytes (R, G, B) per pixel, while a fixed-size buffer is allocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow can cause the `pal2rgb` application to crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The overflow could potentially allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. This is mentioned in the Debian security advisory (DSA-4349-1) and the Gentoo advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted TIFF Image:** An attacker needs to create a specially crafted TIFF image file that, when processed by the vulnerable `pal2rgb` tool, triggers the heap buffer overflow.
*   The vulnerable `pal2rgb` tool is executed with the crafted TIFF file as input, typically through the command line:  `./tools/pal2rgb $FILE /dev/null`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote or Local:** The attacker could be either local, by enticing the user to process the crafted TIFF file, or remote, where an automated system processes crafted files.
*   **Ability to Craft TIFF Images:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a TIFF image with specific `COLORMAP`, `ImageWidth`, and `ImageLength` values that trigger the vulnerability in `pal2rgb`.
*   **User Interaction (Potentially):** Exploitation might require tricking a user or an automated system into opening the malicious image, making it a social engineering vector in some scenarios.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `pal2rgb.c` file of LibTIFF.
*   The `TIFFScanlineSize` function could return a value that does not account for the RGB expansion, leading to a buffer of 225 bytes instead of the necessary 3 * ImageWidth bytes.
*   The exploit involves writing RGB data into the output buffer based on the `imagewidth` and `imagelength` of the input TIFF file, while the buffer is not large enough.

**Affected Versions:**

*   LibTIFF versions prior to 4.1.0 are vulnerable (as stated in the Gentoo advisory).
*   Specifically mentioned vulnerable version: 4.0.9 (as mentioned in the Exploit DB and Bugzilla entries).

**Patches/Mitigations:**

*   Patches were created to prevent buffer overflows. This involved correctly allocating the buffer size and adding a check to ensure the output buffer is 3x the input buffer.
