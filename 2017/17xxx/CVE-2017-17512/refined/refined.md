Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `sensible-browser` utility in `sensible-utils` does not properly validate strings before launching a web browser specified by the `BROWSER` environment variable.
- Specifically, it did not prevent the injection of command-line arguments through a crafted URL containing IFS characters or leading dashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Argument Injection:** The primary vulnerability is argument injection. By crafting a malicious URL with special characters or leading dashes, an attacker can inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the browser command executed by `sensible-browser`.
- **Lack of URI Validation:** The utility does not validate the URI/URL it receives, allowing for the injection of potentially harmful arguments.
- **Unsafe Usage of BROWSER variable:** The utility used the BROWSER environment variable unsafely, allowing %s expansion and multiple browsers to be specified leading to unexpected behaviour.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious arguments that cause the browser to perform unintended actions. This could include:
    - Overriding proxy settings to redirect traffic through an attacker-controlled proxy server.
    - Launching the browser in incognito mode, or other potentially harmful browser flags.
    - Potentially running arbitrary commands through the browser
    - Launching a different application by crafting the BROWSER variable

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted URLs:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs that contain command-line arguments.
- **BROWSER Environment Variable:** The attacker leverages the `BROWSER` environment variable which is used to determine which browser to open.
- **Applications using sensible-browser:**  Applications like Emacs, Lilypond and xdg-open, that use `sensible-browser` or similar utilities, may be tricked into passing malicious URLs to `sensible-browser`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL that is passed to `sensible-browser`. This could be through a malicious website, an email, a file, or other means.
- The attacker needs to have some control of the environment, such as being able to control or influence the user's BROWSER environment variable and the ability to send a link that will be opened by the victim's machine.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by removing support for `%s` expansion in the `BROWSER` variable, thus preventing argument injection.
- The fixes were backported to older releases for Debian and Ubuntu.
- Other applications like `lilypond-invoke-editor` and `xdg-open` were also found to be vulnerable to similar argument injection issues.
- The fix in Debian involved removing support for multiple browsers and the unsupported `%s` variable.
