- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `content` parameter in the `script_test.jsp` endpoint. The application constructs a system call using a user-supplied string from this parameter, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining access to the web service's context, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the vulnerable `script_test.jsp` endpoint of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning that the attacker does not need any valid credentials to launch the attack.
