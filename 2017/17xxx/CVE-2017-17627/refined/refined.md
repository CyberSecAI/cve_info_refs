      "content": "Readymade Video Sharing Script 3.2 is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `report_videos[]` parameter in the `single-video-detail.php` script.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete server compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n  - The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request to the `single-video-detail.php` script.\n  - The `report_videos[]` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the target web application. No prior authentication is required. The attacker can inject SQL commands via the vulnerable parameter and using boolean-based blind and time-based blind techniques to extract data."
