Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in the "Single Theater Booking" application:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Location:** `http://www.theaterbookingscript.com/demo/theater-booking/single-theater/admin/viewtheatre.php?theatreid=`
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `theatreid` parameter before displaying it on the page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious user can inject JavaScript code into the `theatreid` parameter. When another user visits the crafted URL, the injected script will execute in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
    *   **Example:**  `http://www.theaterbookingscript.com/demo/theater-booking/single-theater/admin/viewtheatre.php?theatreid=29%27%22%3Etest%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=console.log(%27xss2%27)%3Etest%3C%27%22test`
2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Location:** `http://www.theaterbookingscript.com/demo/theater-booking/single-theater/admin/sitesettings.php`
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize user input provided in the `title` parameter of the POST request when updating site settings.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A malicious user can submit a POST request with a malicious payload in the `title` parameter that will be stored in the database and executed when the page is loaded.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS, this allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the browsers of users viewing the affected pages. This can lead to cookie theft, website defacement, and redirects to malicious sites.
    *   **Example:**
        ```
        POST parameters:
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"
        Ticket Booking'"><svg/onload=alert('xss')><'"
        ```
3.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Location:** `http://www.theaterbookingscript.com/demo/theater-booking/single-theater/admin/movieview.php?movieid=`
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize the `movieid` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A malicious user can inject SQL code into the `movieid` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive data from the database, potentially modify data, or even gain full control of the database server.
    *   **Example:**  The content notes that the attacker can obtain data user and other sensitive data by using this vulnerability.
4.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Location:** `http://www.theaterbookingscript.com/demo/theater-booking/single-theater/admin/sitesettings.php`
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page or link that, when visited by a logged-in user, will submit a request to change the site settings without the user's knowledge or consent.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can modify the site's settings, including injecting stored XSS payloads (as demonstrated in the provided PoC), changing email addresses and other sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** The provided PoC demonstrates how to construct an HTML page that sends a POST request with a malicious payload to change site settings, including injecting XSS code into the website title. The attack can be carried out without the attacker needing to log in to the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking it.
*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker must be able to submit a POST request to the site settings page with malicious payload in the 'title' parameter, this requires admin access.
*   **SQLi:**  The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing SQL injection code within the `movieid` parameter.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage or link that submits the crafted request.
