Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-17831:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Git LFS parses URLs, specifically `ssh://` URLs, from the `.lfsconfig` file. It was possible to inject arbitrary command options by crafting a malicious `ssh://` URL with the `-oProxyCommand` option, which would then be executed by the underlying SSH client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is command injection. By including the `-oProxyCommand` option in the `ssh://` URL, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system running Git LFS.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** Git LFS failed to properly sanitize or validate the provided SSH URL, specifically when the `-oProxyCommand` option was included. This allowed arbitrary commands to be passed to the SSH client.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or any other action the attacker desires.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious `.lfsconfig` file:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted `.lfsconfig` file within a Git repository. This file contains the malicious `ssh://` URL.
*   **Cloning/Pulling Repository:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user clones or pulls a repository containing the malicious `.lfsconfig` file.
*   **Sourcetree URI handler:** The vulnerability could be triggered from a webpage through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler, by crafting a special URI that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Write access to the repository:** An attacker needs write access to the repository to insert the malicious `.lfsconfig` file.
*   **Target interaction:** The victim must clone or pull the repository with the crafted `.lfsconfig` or trigger the attack via the URI handler.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not directly in Git itself but in the Git LFS extension.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple platforms (macOS and Windows).
*   The issue is described as "old-school" due to similarity with a prior CVE (CVE-2004-0489).
*   The vulnerability was also discovered in GitLab, SVN and Mercurial through a similar method of injecting the `-oProxyCommand` option.
*   The fix was to sanitize the SSH options parsed from `ssh://` URLs.
*   The issue was quickly resolved by Github after being disclosed.
