Git LFS v2.1.1 ships with bug fixes and a security patch fixing a remote code

execution vulnerability exploitable by setting a SSH remote via your

repository's `.lfsconfig` to contain the string "-oProxyCommand". This

vulnerability is only exploitable if an attacker has write access to your

repository, or you clone a repository with a `.lfsconfig` file containing that

string.

# Compromise On Checkout - Vulnerabilities in SCM Tools

## First Round: Git LFS

In mid May 2017, I was about to go on my two month parental leave, when I stumbled across
a nifty vulnerability in [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), which is
developed by the fine people at GitHub. The actual vulnerability was shockingly
simple: Git LFS can be configured (partially) by a `.lfsconfig` file within the
repository utilizing LFS and it was possible to point Git LFS to crafted
`ssh://` URLs of the following form:

```
[lfs]
    url = ssh://-oProxyCommand=some-command

```

When cloning a repository with such a `.lsfconfig` file, Git with the LFS plugin
would happily try to invoke ssh in order to get the LFS objects from a host
`-oProxyCommand=some-command`. SSH, however, would interpret that hostname as
an `-o` option and subsequently try to invoke `some-command` in order to establish a
connection (see also `man 5 ssh_config`).

So, arbitrary command execution was possible via a crafted repository for Git LFS
clients, which clone the repository. This issue was disclosed to GitHub and has been
resolved in a very quick fashion.

Despite this attack vector being relatively âold-schoolâ
(see [CVE-2004-0489](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-0489))
it turned out to affect more than just Git LFS.

So, letâs now skip over two months of (almost) full time parenting during my leave
;).

## Second Round: Git(Lab)

Mid July 2017, I was back at the Recurity Labs office and the first project
after a two months hacking hiatus was an assessment on
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com). I quickly discovered a Command Execution issue by
using the very same trigger as for Git LFS. By importing a repository in a new
project with an `ssh://`, URL server-side code execution was possible on a
GitLab host. I was obviously happy to start with an RCE on the first day after
the break. However, this issue, when taking a closer look, was beyond LFS and
GitLab; it affected `git clone` directly.

For instance, the following command line would pop a `gnome-calculator`:

```
$ git clone ssh://-oProxyCommand=gnome-calculator/wat
Cloning into 'wat'...
Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

```

While it might be tricky to convince a user to clone a repository with
a rather shady looking `ssh://` URL, this attack vector is exploitable in a more
sneaky way when it comes to Git submodules. So, it is possible to create a Git
repository that contains a crafted `ssh://` submodule URL. When such a
repository is cloned recursively, or the submodule is updated, the `ssh://` payload
will trigger.

Brian Neel, who was Recurity Labsâ contact at GitLab for the assessment,
exemplary coordinated the disclosure to the closed git-security list.

## Third Round: SVN and Mercurial

Within the process of creating a fix for Git, two more vulnerabilities surfaced:
The very same issue affected SVN and Mercurial as well. After double checking,
it could be confirmed that SVN was affected in the worst way:
SVN follows HTTP 301 redirects to `svn+ssh://` URLs. As a result, an innocent
looking HTTP URL can be used to trigger a Command Execution with a 301
redirect.

# An open source Git extension for versioning large files

Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.

[Download v3.6.1 (Windows)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-windows-v3.6.1.exe)

[Download v3.6.1 (Mac - Intel Silicon)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-darwin-amd64-v3.6.1.zip)

[Download v3.6.1 (Mac - Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-darwin-arm64-v3.6.1.zip)

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh): `brew install git-lfs`

[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):    `port install git-lfs`

[Install v3.6.1 via PackageCloud (Linux)](https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/install)

[Download v3.6.1 (Linux - x86-64)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-linux-amd64-v3.6.1.tar.gz)

## How it works:

![a diagram showing how Git LFS works](/images/graphic.gif)

[Git LFS security update: All users should update to 3.6.1.](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q6r2-x2cc-vrp7)

## Getting Started

1. Download and install the Git command line extension. Once downloaded and installed, set up Git LFS for your user account by running:

   ```
   git lfs install
   ```

   You only need to run this once per user account.
2. In each Git repository where you want to use Git LFS, select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

   ```
   git lfs track "*.psd"
   ```

   Now make sure .gitattributes is tracked:

   ```
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

   Note that defining the file types Git LFS should track will not, by itself, convert any pre-existing files to Git LFS, such as files on other branches or in your prior commit history. To do that, use the [git lfs migrate(1)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate.adoc?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=doc_man_migrate_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs) command, which has a range of options designed to suit various potential use cases.
3. There is no step three. Just commit and push as you normally would; for instance, if your current branch is named `main`:

   ```

   git add file.psd
   git commit -m "Add design file"
   git push origin main
   ```

   Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=wiki_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs), [discussion forum](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=discussions_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs), and [documentation](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/tree/main/docs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=docs_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs) for help with any questions you might have!

## Git LFS is an open source project

To start a discussion, file an issue, or contribute to the project, head over [to the repository](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=repo_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs)
or read our [guide to contributing](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=contributing_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs).

If you're interested in integrating Git LFS into another tool or product, you might want to read the
[API specification](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/api/README.md?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=api_spec_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs)
or check out our [reference server implementation](https://github.com/git-lfs/lfs-test-server?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=reference_servedr&utm_campaign=gitlfs).

## Features

* ### Large file versioning

  Version large files—even those as large as a couple GB in size—with Git.
* ### More repository space

  Host more in your Git repositories. External file storage makes it easy to keep your repository at a manageable size.
* ### Faster cloning and fetching

  Download less data. This means faster cloning and fetching from repositories that deal with large files.
* ### Same Git workflow

  Work like you always do on Git—no need for additional commands, secondary storage systems, or toolsets.
* ### Same access controls and permissions

  Keep the same access controls and permissions for large files as the rest of your Git repository when working with a remote host like GitHub.

### **Sourcetree for macOS and Windows - Mercurial: arbitrary command execution in mercurial repositories with a git submodule  (CVE-2017-17458)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

The embedded version of **Mercurial** used in Sourcetree for macOS and Sourcetree for Windows was vulnerable to[CVE-2017-17458](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17458). An attacker can exploit this issue if they commit to a Mercurial repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows by adding a git subrepository specifying **arbitrary code** in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on systems running a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows. Sourcetree for macOS and Sourcetree for Windows perform background indexing, which allows for this issue to be exploited without a user needing to directly interact with the git subrepository.

From version 1.4.0 of Sourcetree for macOS and 0.8.4b of Sourcetree for Windows, this vulnerability can be triggered from a webpage through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 1.0b2 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-5244>.

Versions of Sourcetree for Windows starting with 0.5.1.0 before version 2.4.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8257>.

#### Acknowledgements

Atlassian would like to credit **Zhang Tianqi @ Tophant** for reporting this issue to us.

### **Sourcetree for macOS and Windows****- Git LFS: Arbitrary command execution in repositories with Git LFS enabled (CVE-2017-17831)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

The embedded version of **Git LFS** used in Sourcetree for macOS and Windows was vulnerable to CVE-2017-17831. An attacker can exploit this issue if they can commit to a git repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows by adding a .lfsconfig file containing a malicious lfs url. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on systems running a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows. This vulnerability can also be triggered from a web page through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 2.1 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at  <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-5246>.

Versions of Sourcetree for Windows starting with 1.7.0 before version 2.4.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8261>.
