Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the JEXTN FAQ Pro component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `com_jefaqpro` component's `category` view is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject SQL commands into the vulnerable parameter.
*   This could allow an attacker to potentially:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application and possibly the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL. The exploit example provided is:
    `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_jefaqpro&view=category&id=[SQL]&Itemid=494`
*  The `[SQL]` part is where the attacker injects the malicious SQL query

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target Joomla website.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to know that the `com_jefaqpro` component is installed and vulnerable, as well as the vulnerable URL parameter.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker requires a working understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL payloads.
