- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the Common Open Policy Service Protocol (COPS) module of affected Huawei products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input validation when processing COPS messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to abnormal service behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker needs to control the peer device and send a specially crafted COPS message to the vulnerable Huawei product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected product and control of a peer device to send malicious COPS messages.
