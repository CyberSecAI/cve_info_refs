Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17588

**Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `f`, `s`, and `id` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-provided input from the `f`, `s`, and `id` GET parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, including potentially user credentials, private information, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can be used to elevate privileges within the application or the underlying operating system.
- **Denial of Service:** By inserting malicious queries that cause the database to slow or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered through specially crafted GET requests to the following PHP files with malicious SQL payloads in the specified parameters:
    - `movie.php?f=[SQL]`
    - `tvshow.php?s=[SQL]`
    - `show_misc_video.php?id=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL syntax is required to construct the injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit examples do not indicate a need for authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
