```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - TBE-01-002: Weak parsing of email addresses in the "Full Name" field due to flawed regular expressions. The regular expressions can be fooled by injecting additional '<>' pairs and commas into the email address, leading to the use of a malicious PGP key.
  - TBE-01-005: Replay of encrypted content due to the way Enigmail handles partially encrypted emails. When a victim replies to or forwards a message containing previously encrypted content, the content is decrypted and can be leaked to an attacker.
  - TBE-01-021: Flawed parsing of email attachments, where Enigmail incorrectly verifies the signature of an attached email against the text of the attached email only, making it appear as if the entire message was signed.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - TBE-01-002: Vulnerable regular expressions in `funcs.jsm`'s `stripEmail` function allows for email address spoofing via crafted "Full Name" fields.
  - TBE-01-005:  Lack of proper warnings or handling of partial encryption when replying or forwarding emails.
  - TBE-01-021: Inadequate separation of email content from attachment content when verifying signatures.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - TBE-01-002: Complete and silent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) compromise of email threads. The attacker can intercept, decrypt, and potentially alter email communications.
  - TBE-01-005: Plaintext of encrypted emails can be leaked to an attacker.
  - TBE-01-021: Faked signature display, where a malicious email can appear to be legitimately signed, leading to trust of a forged message.
- Attack vectors:
  - TBE-01-002: Network attacker modifies the "Full Name" field in SMTP communications.
  - TBE-01-005: Intercepting encrypted messages and inserting the encrypted data block into a conversation or crafting a message with the encrypted data for forwarding.
  - TBE-01-021: Crafting an email with an attached signed email.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - TBE-01-002: Ability to modify the "Full Name" field in SMTP communications.
  - TBE-01-005: Ability to intercept encrypted messages and send crafted emails to the victim.
  - TBE-01-021: Ability to craft email messages.
