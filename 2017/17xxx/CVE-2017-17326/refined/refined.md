- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient protection of the activation lock mechanism in Huawei smartphones. The "find my phone" feature, which should prevent unauthorized use after a reset, is not properly implemented.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate protection of the activation lock. The software allows bypassing the activation lock mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the activation lock on a reset smartphone and activate it with a new account, effectively gaining unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the smartphone is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have physical possession of the device. They must perform a series of steps on the device, as described in the advisory, to bypass the activation lock and set up the phone with a new account.
