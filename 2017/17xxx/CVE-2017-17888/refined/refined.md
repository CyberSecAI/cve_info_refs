Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17888:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `write.cgi` script of the Anti-Web httpd server. Specifically, the script allows an attacker to write arbitrary content to a file and subsequently execute it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The core issue is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This is achieved by writing a script containing the attacker's command to a file and then executing that file using the `write.cgi` script.
*  **Insecure file uploads**: The `write.cgi` script allows arbitrary file writes via multipart form data, where an attacker can specify the path, size, and content of a file to be created on the server.
* **Lack of input validation**: The vulnerability arises because there is no sanitization of user-supplied data used to construct the file path, content or parameters to be passed to `sh` for execution, which enables arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server, potentially leading to full control over the affected system.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, modify configurations, and install malware.
*   **Denial of Service:** By executing resource-intensive commands, attackers can disrupt the availability of the targeted system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is launched via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/write.cgi` endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The request utilizes multipart form data to submit parameters, including the filename, content, and execution parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint**: The attacker needs to know the path `/cgi-bin/write.cgi`
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP POST request with multipart form data.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The exploit does not appear to require prior authentication, based on the provided information.
*   **Cookie:** The provided PoC uses a cookie value, which suggests the session might be necessary, but the details are unclear from the provided content.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit involves sending a POST request to `/cgi-bin/write.cgi` with the following multipart form data:

*   `script1`: set to `file`
*   `filename1`:  The full path where the malicious script will be written on the server. Example `/home/httpd/pageimages/RCE.sh`.
*   `maxsize1`: Maximum size allowed for the file.
*   `content1`:  The attacker's command to be executed, prepended with `/bin/` Example: `/bin/id`.
*   `script2`: set to `execute`
*   `path2`:  The command that will be executed through the system shell, for example `sh /home/httpd/pageimages/RCE.sh`.

The `content1` parameter allows the attacker to write an arbitrary command to a file, and `path2` allows the execution of said file.

The provided Python PoC script automates this process by constructing the malicious request with a given cookie and command, sends it to the target, and subsequently retrieves the output of the executed command using a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the same script through the `page` parameter.

**Affected Products:**

The vulnerability affects various products and vendors using the Anti-Web httpd server, including:

*   NetBiter / HMS (WS100, FGW200, NetBiter webSCADA)
*   Ouman (Ouman EH-net)
*   Alliance System (WS100/AWU 500)
*   Sauter (ERW100F001)
*   Carlo Gavazzi (SIU-DLG)
*   SMART-1 (AEDILIS SMART-1)
*   SYXTHSENSE (WebBiter)
*   ABB (SREA-01, SREA-50)
*   ASCON (DY WebServer)

The vulnerability affects versions of Anti-Web from 3.0.x up to 3.7.x.  Versions 3.8.1 and higher are not vulnerable.
