Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17632

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the `findcity.php` file of the Responsive Events & Movie Ticket Booking Script version 3.2.1. Specifically, the `q` parameter in the `findcity.php` script is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input within the `q` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
* **Blind SQL Injection:** The exploit demonstrates both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques, meaning that even if the application doesn't directly output results of the query, the attacker can still extract information by observing the server's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the application's database. This includes user information, event details, and other confidential data.
* **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could modify or delete data, potentially causing disruption to the application's functionality or data integrity.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, successful SQL injection might allow the attacker to gain administrative privileges.
* **Server Compromise:** In severe cases, SQL injection can be a stepping stone to a full server compromise, though this is not directly described in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `findcity.php` and injecting SQL code into the `q` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This usually requires network access.
* **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the necessary payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vulnerable Software:** Responsive Events & Movie Ticket Booking Script version 3.2.1
*   **Vulnerable File:** `findcity.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `q` (GET parameter)
*   **Exploit Type:** Web application exploit.
*   **Exploit Technique:** SQL Injection (blind boolean-based and time-based).
