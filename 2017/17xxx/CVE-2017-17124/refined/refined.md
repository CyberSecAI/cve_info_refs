Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17124:

**Verification:**

The provided content includes a Gentoo Security Advisory that lists CVE-2017-17124 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting binutils. It also includes a bug report from sourceware.org which provides more detail on the vulnerability. Thus, the content is relevant to CVE-2017-17124.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `_bfd_coff_read_string_table` function of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically when processing malformed COFF (Common Object File Format) files.
- The vulnerability occurs because the function does not properly validate the size of the string table, allowing an attacker to specify an excessively large size. This can lead to the allocation of an enormous amount of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and/or buffer overflow when writing data to the allocated region.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow
- Insufficient validation of string table size in COFF files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition by providing a malicious COFF file to a vulnerable application that uses the affected binutils library, specifically `objdump`. The excessive memory allocation will cause the system to slow down or crash.
- Possible memory corruption: The overflow can corrupt adjacent heap memory which can have unspecified further impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must provide a specially crafted, malformed COFF file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a vulnerable application, like `objdump`, attempts to process this malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious COFF file to a system running a vulnerable version of binutils.
- No specific privileges or local access are required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The provided debugging information shows the exact location of the heap buffer overflow and the call stack leading to it.
- The fix involves adding a check to the `_bfd_coff_read_string_table` function to prevent excessive memory allocation when parsing a COFF string table.
