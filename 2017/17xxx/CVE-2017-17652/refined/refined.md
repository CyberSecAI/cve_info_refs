- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries within the handling of NVBUBackup Count method requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated network access. Specifically through the NVBUBackup Count method requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Quest NetVault Backup server, no authentication is required.
