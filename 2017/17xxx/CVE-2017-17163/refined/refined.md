- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability exists due to insufficient verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a processing crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated local attacker executing specific commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged into the system as an operator.
