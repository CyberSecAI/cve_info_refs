- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of Bluetooth AVDTP/AVCTP messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious Bluetooth AVDTP/AVCTP messages after successful pairing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and have successfully paired with the affected device. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated after pairing.
