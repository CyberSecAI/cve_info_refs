The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the "Techno Portfolio Management Panel", but it does not correspond to CVE-2017-17693. The vulnerabilities include information leak, XSS, SQL Injection, and Broken Access Control.

*   **Information Leak:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application reveals the absolute server path in the response.
    *   **Weakness:** Information disclosure
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive server path information, which could aid further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By sending a crafted request to the search.php script.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user-provided input within the `search.php` script.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted request to the `search.php` script containing malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL and tricking a user to visit it.

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `search.php` script.
    *  **Weakness**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive database information, such as user credentials, or manipulate database entries.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By sending a crafted request to `search.php` with malicious SQL code within the `s` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted requests.

*   **Broken Access Control:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly validate user roles/permissions when deleting feedback.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient authorization.
    *   **Impact:** A normal user can delete feedback intended for admin control by tampering with the session cookie.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker replaces the cookie of a normal user with the cookie of an admin user.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:**  Attacker needs to have access to a normal user account and be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.

**Summary:**

The content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in the "Techno Portfolio Management Panel": information leakage, XSS, SQL injection, and broken access control, none of which match CVE-2017-17693.
