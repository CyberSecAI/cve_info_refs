- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of input data when processing abnormal OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) messages, leading to an out-of-bounds write. Specifically, when a user executes a query command after the device receives such a message, the software writes data past the end of the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a system crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted, abnormal OSPF messages to the vulnerable device over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to access the affected device's network and send the malicious OSPF messages. The attacker does not need authentication. A user on the target device must execute a query command after the abnormal OSPF message is received in order for the vulnerability to trigger.
