Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-17562:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The content explicitly mentions `CVE-2017-17562`, particularly in the context of the GoAhead web server vulnerability, making it relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the GoAhead web server's handling of CGI scripts. Specifically, the server initializes the environment of forked CGI scripts using untrusted HTTP request parameters without proper filtering.
*   This lack of filtering allows an attacker to control arbitrary environment variables for the new CGI process.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unfiltered CGI parameters:** The core weakness is that the `cgiHandler` function passes HTTP request parameters to the environment of a spawned CGI process without proper filtering.
*   **Abuse of `LD_PRELOAD`:** This allows the attacker to inject the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable, which is then processed by the dynamic linker of the spawned CGI process.
*   **Dynamic Linking:** The vulnerability relies on the fact that the CGI executables are dynamically linked.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable, an attacker can force the dynamic linker to load a malicious shared object (.so) file.
*   The attacker can use a constructor attribute to execute arbitrary code within the context of the CGI process.
*   The attacker can therefore achieve arbitrary code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.
*   **POST requests:** The exploit often uses POST requests, where the request body contains the malicious .so file.
*   **CGI Script target:** The attacker needs to target a valid CGI script on the server.
*   **`LD_PRELOAD` Injection:** The attacker injects the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable using HTTP parameters.
*   **`/proc/self/fd/0`**: The attacker uses `/proc/self/fd/0` to point to the temporary file on disk which has the attacker's shared object.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable GoAhead server.
*   **Knowledge of CGI paths:** The attacker needs to know a valid CGI script path on the target server.
*   **Ability to construct HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a malicious shared object file.
*   **No authentication required** In general, no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability

**Technical Details:**

*   **`cgiHandler` Function:** The `cgiHandler` function in `cgi.c` is the location of the vulnerable code. This function collects HTTP parameters, creates environment variables and calls `launchCgi`.
*   **`launchCgi` Function:** This function `fork`s a new process and calls `execve` on the CGI target binary. Importantly, it uses `dup2` to map the POST body to `stdin`.
*   **Dynamic Linker (`ld.so`):** The vulnerability takes advantage of how the dynamic linker (`ld.so`) processes the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. This variable is used by the linker to load shared objects before any other library.
*   **Shared Objects (`.so`):** The attacker crafts a malicious `.so` file with a constructor attribute (`__attribute__((constructor))`), which ensures the code is executed when the shared object is loaded by the dynamic linker.
*   **`procfs` filesystem :** The attacker uses the `/proc/self/fd/0` to reference the temporary file on disk that is used by the cgi process for stdin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `elttam` blog post (and code) provides a detailed analysis, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability and provides a PoC.
*   The vulnerability affects GoAhead web servers with CGI support enabled and using dynamically linked executables (CGI scripts).
*   The fix for the vulnerability involves sanitizing the CGI parameters and skipping special variable names (e.g., `LD_`).
*   Metasploit has a module that implements this exploit, showcasing its practical impact.
*   The vulnerability has been observed in a significant number of internet facing devices.
