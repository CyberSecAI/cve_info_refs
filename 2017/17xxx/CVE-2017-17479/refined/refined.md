Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2017-17479:**

This content does not directly mention CVE-2017-17479. However, it discusses similar vulnerabilities to **CVE-2017-14041** present in two functions within the `openjpeg` library.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Similar Vulnerability to CVE-2017-14041:** The issue author identifies two functions `pgxtovolume` in `src/bin/jp3d/convert.c` and `pgxtoimage` in `src/bin/jpwl/convert.c` as being similar to the vulnerable function in CVE-2017-14041, which was patched with commit e528531.
*   **`fscanf` Format String Vulnerability (Potential):** The functions use `fscanf` with a format string that includes `%[ ]` and `%d`, and other format specifiers for reading data from a file. If the input file has unexpected or malicious content, it may cause `fscanf` to read beyond allocated buffers or cause other undefined behavior.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The issue highlights that the functions read multiple parameters, including width, height, and precision, without validating the values read. This lack of input validation can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities. Specifically, the width (`w`) and height (`h`) are used later in the code, potentially leading to an exploitable situation.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the use of `fscanf` with format specifiers that rely on user-supplied data without proper input validation and sanitization. Specifically, using `%[...]` and `%d` specifiers without proper safeguards against invalid input values can lead to exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** If a crafted input file is provided with extremely large `w` and `h` values, the code can be tricked into allocating a large memory buffer, potentially leading to a denial of service.
*   **Denial of Service:** A crash is possible due to invalid memory access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If the fscanf reads data into a stack buffer and the buffer is overflowed, it can leak data or modify return addresses, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted image file (PGX format) that contains unexpected content in its header.
*   **File Format Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable functions parse the header of the PGX file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious input file:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious PGX file to the application utilizing the vulnerable openjpeg library.
*   **Target application must be parsing the PGX file format:** The application needs to be using the vulnerable functions (`pgxtovolume` or `pgxtoimage`) for parsing the image files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue author correctly identifies the similarity of the vulnerable code to the patched vulnerability CVE-2017-14041, indicating a pattern of insecure usage of `fscanf` in the library.
*   The issue report suggests that similar input validation should be done as in the patch for CVE-2017-14041

In summary, this content identifies potential vulnerabilities similar to CVE-2017-14041 within two functions in `openjpeg`, due to unsafe usage of fscanf and a lack of input validation when parsing image headers. These can potentially lead to crashes, DoS and potentially arbitrary code execution with a malicious file.
