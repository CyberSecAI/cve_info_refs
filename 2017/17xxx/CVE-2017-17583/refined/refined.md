Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17583:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the FS Shutterstock Clone 1.0 application. This occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious SQL commands through the `keywords` parameter in the application's form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database Exposure:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, potentially including user credentials, application data, or other confidential information.
- **Database Manipulation:** The attacker can modify, delete, or add data to the database, potentially causing data corruption, application malfunction, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can be a stepping stone for further attacks, such as privilege escalation or gaining control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a web form that accepts the `keywords` parameter. Specifically the "http://server/Category/" endpoint is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques is required.
- No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided exploit code shows that an attacker can inject a malicious SQL query into the `keywords` parameter, using a specific payload, such as:
`1'and (select 1 from (select count(*),concat((select(select concat(cast(database() as char),0x7e,0x494853414e2053454e43414e)) from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() limit 0,1),floor(rand(0)*2))x from information_schema.tables group by x)a) AND ''='`
This specific payload attempts to extract the database name and inject additional data using `concat` function, along with `information_schema.tables` to demonstrate data exfiltration.
- This demonstrates that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
