Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17480:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `pgxtovolume` function in `jp3d/convert.c` of the OpenJPEG library.
*   The root cause is a missing buffer length formatter in `fscanf` call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `fscanf` function is used to read data into a buffer without proper bounds checking. Specifically, it appears the `%[ \t+-]` specifier which attempts to match a sequence of characters within the brackets, is being used to read an arbitrary length sequence of characters into a fixed size buffer `signtmp`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input contains a longer sequence of allowed characters.
* The vulnerability exists in the `jp3d` and `jpwl` codecs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** A crafted JP3D or JPWL file can cause a buffer overflow leading to a crash.
*   **Remote code execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, the buffer overflow could be exploited to overwrite return addresses or other sensitive data on the stack and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Crafted JP3D or JPWL files:** An attacker can create a malicious JP3D or JPWL file with a specially crafted header that, when parsed by OpenJPEG, causes the buffer overflow.
*   **File processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the affected code processes the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious JP3D or JPWL file to a vulnerable application using OpenJPEG.
*   The application needs to parse the malicious input file.
*   The attacker could be remote since the file can be delivered via network.
