The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the Biometric Shift Employee Management System, but none of them correspond to CVE-2017-17990. The vulnerabilities include Stored XSS, CSRF, and Arbitrary File Download.

**Stored XSS:**
- **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Several input fields do not properly escape or sanitize user provided data before storing it into the database.
- **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding.
- **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed by other users of the system when they view the stored data. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack Vectors:**  Manipulating POST parameters to inject XSS payloads in different parts of the application, like employee creation, expense entries, addition/deduction entries, competency criteria, and holiday modifications.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges needed.

**CSRF:**
- **Root Cause:**  Lack of CSRF tokens in sensitive forms allows an attacker to craft malicious requests.
- **Weaknesses:** Absence of CSRF protection.
- **Impact:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions by crafting a malicious link or HTML page, potentially modifying settings or injecting further malicious content via the stored XSS.
- **Attack Vectors:** The provided PoC demonstrates a malicious form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, modifies holiday settings.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires a user to be logged into the application.

**Arbitrary File Download:**
- **Root Cause:** Lack of input validation on the `form_file_name` parameter allows directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation of user-supplied file names.
- **Impact:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive data such as configuration files or system files.
- **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `form_file_name` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../`), the attacker can access files outside the intended directory.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges needed.
