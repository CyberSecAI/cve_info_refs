Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17439:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the `der_length_visible_string` function in `lib/asn1/der_length.c`. This occurs when processing malformed ASN.1 data, specifically when the client name or realm fields are empty (NULL). The function attempts to dereference the NULL pointer when calculating the length of the string, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unconditional dereference of a pointer without checking for NULL.
- Improper handling of malformed ASN.1 data, specifically missing client name or realm.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon.
- The KDC daemon crashes due to a segmentation fault, disrupting Kerberos authentication services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a maliciously crafted UDP packet to the KDC.
- The crafted packet contains empty data fields for client name or realm, triggering the NULL pointer dereference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker, unauthenticated.
- Ability to send UDP packets to the KDC.

**Additional Details**

- The issue exists in Heimdal versions up to 7.4.
- The vulnerable code is in the `_kdc_as_rep` function in `kdc/kerberos5.c`, which calls the vulnerable `der_length_visible_string` function.
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `a873e21d7c06f22943a90a41dc733ae76799390d`
- The fix involves adding a NULL check before dereferencing the pointer within `der_length_visible_string`, preventing the crash.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing AS-REQ messages with a malformed client name.
- The issue was reported on the Debian bug tracker and a fix was proposed.
- The fix was implemented in Heimdal version 7.1.0+dfsg-13+deb9u2 and 7.5.0+dfsg-1, which address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by attackers over the Internet.
