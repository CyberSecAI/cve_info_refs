  "CVE-2017-17968": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in NetTransport.exe due to a long HTTP response.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the target system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious HTTP server sending a crafted, oversized response to the NetTransport client."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control a server that NetTransport attempts to download a file from.",
    "additional_details": "The exploit leverages a ROP chain to bypass DEP and then executes shellcode. The proof-of-concept code provides a working Python exploit, including the crafted ROP chain and shellcode. The exploit triggers a crash at EAX due to the oversized HTTP response, which then allows for the overwrite of EIP."
