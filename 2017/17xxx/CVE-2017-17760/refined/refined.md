Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17760

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect size calculation in the `memcpy` operation within the `cv::PxMDecoder::readData` function when handling PXM image files.
- The `memcpy` operation used `CV_ELEM_SIZE1(m_type)*m_width`, but `img.elemSize1()` should be used instead.
- The incorrect size calculation leads to a buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the allocated memory region.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to the incorrect `memcpy` size calculation when reading PXM image files. This allows writing beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.
- **Integer Overflow:** The Debian security advisories mention integer overflows as a potential problem when reading data, which could be related to this issue, or other data handling issues in OpenCV.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A heap-buffer-overflow leading to a crash, as the provided AddressSanitizer output shows that the program crashes.
- **Unspecified Impact:** The Debian security advisories mentioned that these issues could lead to "other unspecified impact" which may include remote code execution in some cases, data corruption, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PXM Image File:** An attacker can craft a malicious PXM image file that, when processed by OpenCV's `imread` or related functions, triggers the buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Image File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the image decoding process, specifically within the `PxMDecoder::readData` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a crafted image file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or have the target application process a crafted PXM image file.
- **Application using vulnerable version of OpenCV:** The target application must use a vulnerable version of OpenCV.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp` specifically in the function `PxMDecoder::readData`
- The `memcpy` call on line 337 was the location of the overflow, which is fixed by using the correct calculation size `img.elemSize1()*m_width` instead of `CV_ELEM_SIZE1(m_type)*m_width`.
- The provided AddressSanitizer output shows a heap-buffer-overflow during a `memcpy` call in function `cv::PxMDecoder::readData`.
-  The patch was to correct the size calculation of the memcpy operation by using the size of the destination image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Debian security advisories indicate that the vulnerability affects versions of OpenCV prior to the patched versions (2.3.1-11+deb7u3, 2.4.9.1+dfsg-1+deb8u2 and 2.4.9.1+dfsg1-2+deb9u1).
- The issue was addressed in commit `7bbe1a53cfc097b82b1589f7915a2120de39274c`.
- The issue is tracked by the OpenCV issue #10351 and pull request #10369
