The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the "Readymade Video Sharing Script", including SQL Injection, Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   **Root cause:**  Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input in the `search_video.php` and `viewsubs.php` pages.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper output encoding leading to the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack vector:** A crafted URL with malicious JavaScript is sent to a user. When the user clicks the link, the JavaScript executes in the user's browser.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to generate and send a URL to a victim.

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the user profile editing functionality (`user-profile-edit.php`).
    *  **Weakness:**  The application stores unsanitized user input (`fname`) and renders it, allowing JavaScript injection.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject JavaScript code that persists within the application and executes when other users view the affected data.
    *  **Attack vector:** Malicious Javascript is injected through a POST request to `user-profile-edit.php`.
    *  **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make a POST request to the `user-profile-edit.php` page, potentially by authenticating to the application or via CSRF (as demonstrated)

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root cause:**  The application fails to properly sanitize input passed to SQL queries in `search_video.php` and `viewsubs.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive database information, modify data, or even compromise the database server.
    *   **Attack vector:**  Crafted URL parameters are injected into SQL queries.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to generate and send a URL to a victim.

*   **CSRF:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `user-profile-edit.php` does not implement proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper CSRF tokens or other protection mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can trick a user into unintentionally changing their profile information or injecting stored XSS through profile fields.
    *   **Attack vector:**  A malicious web page with a crafted request targeting a logged-in user of the application can be used. The user has to be logged in the vulnerable application.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick a user to visit a malicious website with a CSRF attack.
