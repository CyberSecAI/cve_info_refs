\*\* DISPUTED \*\* common/help.c in Geomview 1.9.5 does not validate strings
before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable,
which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks
via a crafted URL. NOTE: this is disputed by a third party because no
untrusted input can be used for the injection.

| [Description](#c0)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2018-03-19 14:55:02 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-17530 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17530>):   common/help.c in Geomview 1.9.5 does not validate strings before launching   the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow   remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL.   @Maintainers please confirm if we are affected.  Thank you ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-08-11 00:09:30 UTC  ``` Hm, the functionality linked in Debian's tracker bug seems to be for viewing the local documentation installed with the package. I'm not sure how an attacker could manipulate the URLs it's fed. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-08-11 01:52:05 UTC  ``` Specifically, the vulnerable code is this (<https://sources.debian.org/src/geomview/1.9.5-1/src/bin/geomview/common/help.c/?hl=51#L83>):      snprintf(helper, PATH_MAX, "%s %s &", browser, file);     dummy = system(helper);  So if `browser` or `file` can be controlled by an attacker, the attacker controls the command line passed to system(). In particular, the CVE says the BROWSER environment variable could be problematic. I think it means WEBBROWSER. At line 50, if WEBBROWSER is set in the environment, `browser` gets the value of WEBBROWSER, else it gets the value of the macro DFLTHTMLBROWSER, which is `firefox` by default.    if (*htmlbrowser == '\0') {     if ((browser = getenv("WEBBROWSER")) == NULL) {       browser = DFLTHTMLBROWSER;     }   } else {     browser = htmlbrowser;   }  Since environment variables are implicitly trusted here, WEBBROWSER seems uninteresting, so let's look at `file`, at line 71:    if ((docdir = getenv("GEOMVIEW_DOC_DIR")) == NULL) {     docdir = DOCDIR; /* compile-time default */   }    if (strncasecmp(type, "html", strlen("html")) == 0) {     [snip]     dfltfile = "%s/html/index.html";     langfile = "%s/html/%s/index.html";   }    [snip]    if ((lang = getenv("LANG")) != NULL) {     snprintf(helper, PATH_MAX, langfile, docdir, lang);     file = findfile(NULL, helper);   }   if (file == NULL) {     snprintf(helper, PATH_MAX, dfltfile, docdir);     file = findfile(NULL, helper);   }  Since the environment is trusted, we can ignore the conditional based on getenv(). If LANG is not set in the environment, `helper` will get the value of dfltfile, which is "%s/html/index.html", where the "%s" is replaced with `docdir`. The only way to control `docdir` at runtime is via the GEOMVIEW_DOC_DIR environment variable, which we can again treat as trusted as coming from the environment.  I don't think there's any impact here. ``` |  |

| [Description](#c0)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2018-03-19 14:55:02 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-17530 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17530>):   common/help.c in Geomview 1.9.5 does not validate strings before launching   the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow   remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL.   @Maintainers please confirm if we are affected.  Thank you ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-08-11 00:09:30 UTC  ``` Hm, the functionality linked in Debian's tracker bug seems to be for viewing the local documentation installed with the package. I'm not sure how an attacker could manipulate the URLs it's fed. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-08-11 01:52:05 UTC  ``` Specifically, the vulnerable code is this (<https://sources.debian.org/src/geomview/1.9.5-1/src/bin/geomview/common/help.c/?hl=51#L83>):      snprintf(helper, PATH_MAX, "%s %s &", browser, file);     dummy = system(helper);  So if `browser` or `file` can be controlled by an attacker, the attacker controls the command line passed to system(). In particular, the CVE says the BROWSER environment variable could be problematic. I think it means WEBBROWSER. At line 50, if WEBBROWSER is set in the environment, `browser` gets the value of WEBBROWSER, else it gets the value of the macro DFLTHTMLBROWSER, which is `firefox` by default.    if (*htmlbrowser == '\0') {     if ((browser = getenv("WEBBROWSER")) == NULL) {       browser = DFLTHTMLBROWSER;     }   } else {     browser = htmlbrowser;   }  Since environment variables are implicitly trusted here, WEBBROWSER seems uninteresting, so let's look at `file`, at line 71:    if ((docdir = getenv("GEOMVIEW_DOC_DIR")) == NULL) {     docdir = DOCDIR; /* compile-time default */   }    if (strncasecmp(type, "html", strlen("html")) == 0) {     [snip]     dfltfile = "%s/html/index.html";     langfile = "%s/html/%s/index.html";   }    [snip]    if ((lang = getenv("LANG")) != NULL) {     snprintf(helper, PATH_MAX, langfile, docdir, lang);     file = findfile(NULL, helper);   }   if (file == NULL) {     snprintf(helper, PATH_MAX, dfltfile, docdir);     file = findfile(NULL, helper);   }  Since the environment is trusted, we can ignore the conditional based on getenv(). If LANG is not set in the environment, `helper` will get the value of dfltfile, which is "%s/html/index.html", where the "%s" is replaced with `docdir`. The only way to control `docdir` at runtime is via the GEOMVIEW_DOC_DIR environment variable, which we can again treat as trusted as coming from the environment.  I don't think there's any impact here. ``` |  |
