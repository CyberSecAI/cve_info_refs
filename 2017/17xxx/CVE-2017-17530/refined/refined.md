{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application `Geomview` does not properly sanitize the strings before using them to launch the program specified by the `BROWSER` environment variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Argument injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can conduct argument injection attacks by crafting a malicious URL, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL that is processed by `Geomview`. The program uses the `BROWSER` environment variable to determine which program to launch.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is in `common/help.c`. The code uses `snprintf` and `system` to launch the browser.  The `WEBBROWSER`, `GEOMVIEW_DOC_DIR`, and `LANG` environment variables are also used in the vulnerable code but are not considered untrusted in the provided analysis."
