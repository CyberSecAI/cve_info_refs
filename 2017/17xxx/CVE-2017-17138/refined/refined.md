The provided content is a security advisory from Huawei, and it is directly related to CVE-2017-17138.

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by insufficient verification in the PEM module of Huawei products. Specifically, an authenticated local attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DoS Vulnerability:** The PEM module has a vulnerability where a specially crafted malicious certificate can cause the processing to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit results in a denial of service. The affected system will become unresponsive or unusable, disrupting normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local.
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the affected system.
*   The attacker needs to place a malicious certificate on the system, which is then processed by the PEM module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a local user on the system.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker needs to place a malicious certificate within the system.
