The vuln in question involves a command injection due to improper sanitization of the User-Agent header. The module makes an initial GET request to the root of the web server and checks the result for a vulnerable firmware version. If vulnerable, it makes a subsequent GET request with the User-Agent set to `\";<payload> #`. This can be verified against WVBR0-25 devices running firmware < 1.0.41.",
