Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in "Readymade Classifieds Script":

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthorized Access:**
    *   **Weakness:** The administrative backend link `http://live.posty.in/admin/user_activate_submit.php` is accessible to unauthenticated users.
    *   **Impact:** This could lead to the leakage of sensitive information or allow malicious users to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the backend URL without prior login.
    *  **Attacker Capability:** Requires no login or authentication to the application.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Weakness:** The `user_activate_submit.php` script is vulnerable to XSS through the `ID` parameter.
        The injection point is: `<http://live.posty.in/admin/user_activate_submit.php?ID=457%27%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(/xss/)%3E%3C%27%22>`
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `ID` parameter in the URL.
   *  **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to craft a malicious URL and trick the victim into visiting it.

3.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Weakness:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via an unspecified parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can gain access to sensitive data from the database, potentially including user data.
    *    **Attack Vector**: Input manipulation of an unspecified parameter to inject SQL code.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires ability to make requests to the web application.

**Root Cause (Inferred):**

*   The root cause of the unauthorized access vulnerability is likely due to the lack of proper access controls on the backend administration pages.
*   The XSS and SQLi vulnerabilities stem from inadequate input validation and sanitization within the `user_activate_submit.php` script. This allows untrusted user-supplied data to be directly included in database queries or the HTML output.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report provides specific vulnerable URLs.
*   The report uses screenshots to provide evidence of exploitation.
