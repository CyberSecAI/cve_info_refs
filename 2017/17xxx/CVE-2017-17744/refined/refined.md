Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17744:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `$_REQUEST['map_id']` parameter in the `custom-map/view/advancedsettings.php` file. The value of this parameter is directly echoed back to the user without any sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the vulnerable page. This can lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - **Unauthorized actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `map_id` parameter.
- Specifically, the vulnerable URL is `http://<host>/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=custom_maps_advanced_settings&map_id=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>` where `<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>` is a basic example, and any other malicious script can be injected there.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to visit it while being authenticated on the affected WordPress site.
- No special privileges on the server are needed, the attacker only needs to be able to deliver the malicious link.
- The attacker can be located anywhere on the network.

- The vulnerable code is in `custom-map/view/advancedsettings.php` at line 9.
- The vulnerable parameter is `map_id`.
- The plugin version affected is version 1.1.
