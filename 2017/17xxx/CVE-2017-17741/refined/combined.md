## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3620-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel

attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715))

It was discovered that the netlink 802.11 configuration interface in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from

userspace. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privilege could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-11089](/security/CVE-2017-11089))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ioctl handling code

in the ISDN subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-12762](/security/CVE-2017-12762))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a

task's default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-144-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-144.193~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.144.135](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-144-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-144.193~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.144.135](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Package        : linux
Version        : 3.2.96-3
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-5754 CVE-2017-17558 CVE-2017-17741 CVE-2017-17805
                 CVE-2017-17806 CVE-2017-17807

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5754

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel
    processors, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged
    process to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in
    the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set
    named Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete
    separation of the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing
    the attack. This solution might have a performance impact, and can
    be disabled at boot time by passing `pti=off' to the kernel
    command line.

CVE-2017-17558

    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
    handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17741

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-17805

    It was discovered that some implementations of the Salsa20 block
    cipher did not correctly handle zero-length input.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
    have other security impact.

CVE-2017-17806

    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
    an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
    intended.  A local user could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-17807

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
    write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
    obtain sensitive information.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.96-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not

properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-16994](/security/CVE-2017-16994))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

It was discovered that the Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus controller driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device resources. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-8043](/security/CVE-2018-8043))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1014-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1014.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1014.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5754

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel
    processors, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged
    process to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in
    the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set
    named Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete
    separation of the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing
    the attack. This solution might have a performance impact, and can
    be disabled at boot time by passing `pti=off' to the kernel
    command line.

CVE-2017-8824

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

CVE-2017-15868

    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol
    (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of the second
    socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to
    memory corruption.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16538

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media driver
    did not correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16939

    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam
    Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec (xfrm) implementation
    did not correctly handle some failure cases when dumping policy
    information through netlink.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17448

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace, not
    just the root namespace, to enable and disable connection tracking
    helpers.  This could lead to denial of service, violation of
    network security policy, or have other impact.

CVE-2017-17449

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace
    to monitor netlink traffic in all net namespaces, not just
    those owned by that user namespace.  This could lead to
    exposure of sensitive information.

CVE-2017-17450

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace to modify
    the global OS fingerprint list.

CVE-2017-17558

    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
    handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17741

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-17805

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-17806

    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
    an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
    intended.  A local user could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-17807

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
    write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
    obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2017-1000407

    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.

CVE-2017-1000410

    Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not correctly
    handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP messages.  An
    attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.51-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3617-3: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerabilities

4 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1016-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0-1016.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)
* [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0.1016.14](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

The path of patched vmmcall will patch 3 bytes opcode 0F 01 C1(vmcall)
to the guest memory, however, write_mmio tracepoint always prints 8 bytes
through *(u64 *)val since kvm splits the mmio access into 8 bytes. This
can result in stack-out-of-bounds read due to access the extra 5 bytes.
This patch fixes it by just accessing the bytes which we operates on.

Before patch:

syz-executor-5567  [007] .... 51370.561696: kvm_mmio: mmio write len 3 gpa 0x10 val 0x1ffff10077c1010f

After patch:

syz-executor-13416 [002] .... 51302.299573: kvm_mmio: mmio write len 3 gpa 0x10 val 0xc1010f

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-8824

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

CVE-2017-16538

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media driver
    did not correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16644

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the hdpvr media driver did not
    correctly handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16995

    Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier did not
    correctly model the behaviour of 32-bit load instructions.  A
    local user can use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17448

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace, not
    just the root namespace, to enable and disable connection tracking
    helpers.  This could lead to denial of service, violation of
    network security policy, or have other impact.

CVE-2017-17449

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace
    to monitor netlink traffic in all net namespaces, not just
    those owned by that user namespace.  This could lead to
    exposure of sensitive information.

CVE-2017-17450

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace to modify
    the global OS fingerprint list.

CVE-2017-17558

    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
    handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17712

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered a race condition in the IPv4 raw socket
    implementation.  A local user could use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel.

CVE-2017-17741

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-17805

    It was discovered that some implementations of the Salsa20 block
    cipher did not correctly handle zero-length input.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
    have other security impact.

CVE-2017-17806

    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
    an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
    intended.  A local user could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-17807

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
    write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
    obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2017-17862

    Alexei Starovoitov discovered that the Extended BPF verifier
    ignored unreachable code, even though it would still be processed
    by JIT compilers.  This could possibly be used by local users for
    denial of service.  It also increases the severity of bugs in
    determining unreachable code.

CVE-2017-17863

    Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier did not
    correctly model pointer arithmetic on the stack frame pointer.
    A local user can use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17864

    Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier could fail to
    detect pointer leaks from conditional code.  A local user could
    use this to obtain sensitive information in order to exploit
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-1000407

    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.

CVE-2017-1000410

    Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not correctly
    handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP messages.  An
    attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

The various problems in the Extended BPF verifier can be mitigated by
disabling use of Extended BPF by unprivileged users:
sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1

Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they
are enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl) then
CVE-2017-17448 can be exploited by any local user.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.65-3+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.38.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)
* [linux-image-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.38.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)
* [linux-image-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.38.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
