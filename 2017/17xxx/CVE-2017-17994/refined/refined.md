The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the Biometric Shift Employee Management System, specifically: Stored XSS, CSRF, and Arbitrary File Download.

**Stored XSS:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization and encoding of user-supplied input in various parts of the application.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to sanitize or properly encode user input, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users when they access the affected parts of the application. This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:**  HTTP POST requests to specific URLs with malicious JavaScript code in parameters like:
    *   `First_Name`, `Last_Name`  while creating new employees.
    *   `expense_name`, `expense_desc` when adding expenses.
    *   `amount` when adding addition/deduction.
    *   `criteria` when managing competency criteria.
    *  `holiday_name` when editing holidays.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints with crafted payloads.

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*  **Weaknesses:** The application does not validate the origin of requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into making unwanted changes to their account or application settings, like adding XSS payloads or changing holiday information.
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious HTML page is crafted with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable application, targeting the user who is already authenticated.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to host a malicious HTML page and trick a logged-in user into accessing it.

**Arbitrary File Download:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of user-provided file names, allowing directory traversal.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not properly validate the `form_file_name` parameter allowing directory traversal.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can download sensitive files from the server by providing a path to a file outside the intended directory.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a GET request with a crafted `form_file_name` parameter to access system files.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint with crafted directory traversal sequences within the `form_file_name` parameter.
