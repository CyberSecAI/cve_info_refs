- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper design of a component in some Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass, allowing deletion of fingerprints without proper authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access to the phone can delete the user's fingerprint data.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the vulnerable device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have physical possession of the target's smartphone and be able to execute specific operations.
