Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17611
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Doctor Search Script 1.0
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `city` parameter of the `list` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject SQL commands into the database query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even take control of the database server. The provided proof of concept demonstrates extracting the database user, database name and version, which highlights the ability to access sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request parameter `city` of the `/list` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code uses a crafted SQL injection payload in the `city` parameter:
```
'+/*!11111UNION*/+/*!11111SELECT*/+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,CONCAT_WS(0x203a20,USER(),DATABASE(),VERSION()),25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52--+-
```
This payload is designed to perform a UNION SELECT query, extracting the user, database name, and version from the database. The `/*!11111UNION*/` and `/*!11111SELECT*/` syntax is used as a bypass technique that is only executed if a MySQL version greater or equal than 5.1.0 is being used.
