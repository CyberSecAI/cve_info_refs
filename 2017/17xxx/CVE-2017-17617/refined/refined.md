Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17617
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Foodspotting Clone Script 1.0
*   **Root Cause:** The application's `quicksearch.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `q` parameter. User-supplied input to the `q` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection. The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as admin usernames and passwords.
    *   An attacker can potentially modify data within the database or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   The provided proof of concept demonstrates that an attacker can extract table and column names from the database.
    *   The provided proof of concept also demonstrates the ability to extract usernames and passwords from the `admin_login` table
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The vulnerability is exposed via the `quicksearch.php` script, which can be accessed over the web.
    *   The attack vector is the `q` parameter in the GET request to `quicksearch.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and inject them into the `q` parameter.
    *   No authentication is required, the vulnerability can be exploited without having to be logged into the application.
    *   Basic knowledge of SQL is required.
