The provided content relates to CVE-2017-17497.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect access control in the `prvTidyTidyMetaCharset` function within `clean.c`. Specifically, the `currentNode` variable is modified within a loop without proper validation of its new value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect access control: The `currentNode` is modified without checking if the new value is valid.
- Use of invalid pointer: When re-entering the loop, `currentNode->next` is an invalid pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault: Accessing invalid memory leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Input manipulation: A crafted input file can trigger the faulty logic within the `prvTidyTidyMetaCharset` function causing it to dereference an invalid pointer during the parsing process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the program with a specifically crafted input file/data that will lead to the vulnerable code section being executed
- No additional privileges are mentioned, meaning local access to the vulnerable program is sufficient.
