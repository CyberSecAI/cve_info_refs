Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-17845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in flawed parsing of email addresses within the Enigmail extension for Thunderbird. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from two regular expressions in Enigmail's `funcs.jsm` file:

1.  `EnigmailFuncsRegexTwoAddr`: This regex is intended to check for invalid email formats, specifically preventing two `<>` brackets from following each other without a comma. However, it can be bypassed by injecting an additional pair of `<>` brackets and including a comma within the spoofed email address (e.g., `<good@example.com,><evil@example.com>`).

2.  `EnigmailFuncsRegexExtractPureEmail`: This regex is intended to extract the email address from within the `<>` brackets. When combined with the bypassed first regex, this regex extracts the incorrect email address, specifically extracting the email containing the injected comma.

This is further compounded by Enigmail stripping the comma, further masking the injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Email Spoofing:** The flawed regex allows an attacker to inject a malicious email address in the "Full Name" field of an email, and trick Enigmail into using the attacker's public key.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** By manipulating the "Full Name" field, the attacker can intercept, read, and modify email communication between two users.
*   **Confidentiality Loss:** The attacker can decrypt messages intended for another recipient.
*   **Covert Key Replacement:** Attackers can use unicode characters (e.g. Cyrillic 'a') that look identical to normal characters to trick Enigmail into looking up a malicious key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete and Silent Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker can silently intercept, read, and modify email communication, without either party being aware of it.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Encrypted emails intended for a specific recipient can be decrypted and read by the attacker.
*   **Falsified Identity:** The attacker can impersonate a legitimate user by using their own key in place of the original user's.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SMTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the "Full Name" field in SMTP communications. This field is commonly modifiable by network attackers.
*   **Malicious "Full Name" Field:** The "Full Name" field in an email can be altered by an attacker. It can also be maliciously altered by the sender.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network attacker:** The attacker needs to be in a position to modify SMTP communications, particularly the "Full Name" field.
*   **Social Engineering:** In some scenarios the attack could involve social engineering techniques.
