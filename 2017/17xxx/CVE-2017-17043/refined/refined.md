**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data, specifically within the `awb-meta-box.php` template.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary script code in the browser of unsuspecting users.
- Potential to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
- Ability to launch other attacks (unspecified).

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL that injects JavaScript code through the "post" parameter in the `awb-meta-box.php` file.
- The specific vulnerable URL is provided: `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/emag-marketplace-connector/templates/order/awb-meta-box.php?post=“/><script>alert(“XSS”)</script>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious JavaScript.
