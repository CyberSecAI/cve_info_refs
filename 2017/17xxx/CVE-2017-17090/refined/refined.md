Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-17090:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `chan_skinny` module of Asterisk, which handles the SCCP (Skinny Client Control Protocol).
- The root cause is a failure to properly release memory allocated for threads created to handle each new session.
- Specifically,  `pthread_join` was only being called during module unload, and only on the active threads at that time. The memory for threads is kept until pthread_join is called or the thread is detached. This caused a memory leak for all threads created.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak caused by the failure to detach or join threads correctly when sessions end.
- **Unauthenticated requests:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by unauthenticated requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly sending crafted SCCP packets causes the Asterisk server to allocate excessive amounts of virtual memory. This eventually leads to memory exhaustion, making the server unable to process requests and ultimately resulting in a denial of service.
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  The memory leak leads to a rapid consumption of virtual memory resources, eventually preventing any new memory allocations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending specially crafted SCCP packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the Asterisk server on the port used by the `chan_skinny` module (typically port 2000).
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior authentication to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved calling `pthread_detach()` on every thread before it exits to release the associated memory.
- The issue was tracked as ASTERISK-27452.
- Debian assigned bug number 883342 to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Asterisk versions 13.18.2 and 15.1.2 and Debian package versions 1:11.13.1~dfsg-2+deb8u5 (jessie) and 1:13.14.1~dfsg-2+deb9u3 (stretch) and 1:1.8.13.1~dfsg1-3+deb7u8 (wheezy).
