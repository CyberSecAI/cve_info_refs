{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory leaks in the `MSLPushImage` function within ImageMagick when processing MSL (Magick Scripting Language) files. Specifically, memory is allocated but not freed in various parts of the code during image processing and cloning operations related to MSL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leaks are present when processing MSL files in functions like `MSLPushImage`, `CloneImage`, `AcquireImage`, and related memory acquisition functions. The code allocates memory for image data, image info, drawing info, and pixel caches, but fails to release this memory in certain execution paths.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The memory leaks can lead to a denial of service by exhausting available memory, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious MSL file that triggers these memory leaks when processed by ImageMagick. The file can be delivered via various means such as email, web uploads, or by convincing a user to open the file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick the user/system into processing a specially crafted MSL file with vulnerable ImageMagick."
