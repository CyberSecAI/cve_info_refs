Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-17320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper memory management in Huawei smartphones. Specifically, the system frees the same memory address twice, leading to a double-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The core weakness is a double free, which occurs when the system attempts to release the same memory block twice. This corrupts the heap metadata and can lead to exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected process. In this case, if the user has root privileges, the attacker can achieve root-level code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Application:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into installing a specially crafted application. This application would likely trigger the double-free vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to install the malicious application.
- **Root Privileges (Likely):** The advisory mentions that the user needs to have root privilege for the vulnerability to be exploited resulting in malicious code execution. Though, the advisory could be assuming a rooted device for the malicious code execution impact.
- **Crafted Application:** The attacker must be able to craft an application that exploits the double-free vulnerability.
