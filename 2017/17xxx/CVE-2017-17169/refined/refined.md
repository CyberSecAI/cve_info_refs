- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple input validation vulnerabilities due to insufficient validation of specific messages within the CIDAM protocol implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation of specific messages within the CIDAM protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could tamper with business processes and cause the system to become abnormal.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, authenticated attacker sends malicious messages to the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network connectivity to the affected device.
