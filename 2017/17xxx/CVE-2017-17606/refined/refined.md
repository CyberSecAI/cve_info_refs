Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-17606

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `city` parameter of the Co-work Space Search Script 1.0. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries to potentially:
    *   Access sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Possibly gain control over the database server and potentially the application server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `city` parameter in the URL of the application. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted SQL injection payload via the `city` parameter in a GET request to the `/list` endpoint:
    `http://localhost/[PATH]/list?city=[SQL]&main_search=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special user level or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, as this can be triggered directly via HTTP.

**Additional details:**
* The exploit was found in version 1.0 of the "Co-work Space Search Script".
* The vendor for the application is "phpscriptsmall.com".
* The exploit was tested on WiN7_x64/KaLiLinuX_x64 environments.
