  "CVE-2017-17485": {
    "description": "jackson-databind: Unsafe deserialization due to incomplete black list (incomplete fix for CVE-2017-15095)",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to incomplete blacklisting of classes that can be used for unsafe deserialization within the jackson-databind library.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unsafe deserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially achieve remote code execution by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing the blacklist that is ineffective if certain libraries (such as c3p0) are available in the classpath.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send JSON data to a system that uses vulnerable versions of jackson-databind, and the c3p0 library or other vulnerable libraries must be present in the classpath."
