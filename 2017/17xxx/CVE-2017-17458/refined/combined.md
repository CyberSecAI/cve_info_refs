### **Sourcetree for macOS and Windows - Mercurial: arbitrary command execution in mercurial repositories with a git submodule  (CVE-2017-17458)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

The embedded version of **Mercurial** used in Sourcetree for macOS and Sourcetree for Windows was vulnerable to[CVE-2017-17458](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17458). An attacker can exploit this issue if they commit to a Mercurial repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows by adding a git subrepository specifying **arbitrary code** in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on systems running a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows. Sourcetree for macOS and Sourcetree for Windows perform background indexing, which allows for this issue to be exploited without a user needing to directly interact with the git subrepository.

From version 1.4.0 of Sourcetree for macOS and 0.8.4b of Sourcetree for Windows, this vulnerability can be triggered from a webpage through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 1.0b2 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-5244>.

Versions of Sourcetree for Windows starting with 0.5.1.0 before version 2.4.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8257>.

#### Acknowledgements

Atlassian would like to credit **Zhang Tianqi @ Tophant** for reporting this issue to us.

### **Sourcetree for macOS and Windows****- Git LFS: Arbitrary command execution in repositories with Git LFS enabled (CVE-2017-17831)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

The embedded version of **Git LFS** used in Sourcetree for macOS and Windows was vulnerable to CVE-2017-17831. An attacker can exploit this issue if they can commit to a git repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows by adding a .lfsconfig file containing a malicious lfs url. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on systems running a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows. This vulnerability can also be triggered from a web page through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 2.1 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at  <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-5246>.

Versions of Sourcetree for Windows starting with 1.7.0 before version 2.4.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8261>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c0)  Zhang Tianqi    2017-11-03 02:30 UTC  ``` I found that using hg to track a crafted mercurial repo with a git submodule can lead to command execution on user's OS.  The root cause is that hg support to add a git submodule to a hg repo.And so that i can use hg to track .git directory and thus modify the git config file from the remote.I use ext helper protocol as a poc.I can modify the git config file to allow ext helper protocol which has been disallowed in the lastest version of git and then when victim do anything on the evil git submodule,ext protocol will be triggered and execute the os command.  Here is the reproduction steps: 1.Create a hg repo; 2.Create a git repo and make a commit to it.(The commit is a must.) 3.Now let us use hg to make a crafted hg repo first. 4.Using hg to checkout the hg repo and then add that git repo as it's submodule. 5.Modify the ./hgrepo/gitsubmodule/.git/config to sth like:  [core]     repositoryformatversion = 0     filemode = true     bare = false     logallrefupdates = true     ignorecase = true     precomposeunicode = true [remote "pwn2own"]     url = ext::whoami     fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* [branch "master"]     remote = origin     merge = refs/heads/master [protocol]     allow = always I modify two parts,change the remote url to "ext::whoami" and add a protocol section to allow ext protocol to be used.  Then commit all above changes and push to the remote.  When other victim using hg command to clone that crafted repo and pull,fetch,checkout,push,etc in the git submodule.Our command will be executed.As we already can control the git config file on the remote,lots of options we can use to execute command or do other things.  Mercurial accidently cover the .git folder with user applied .git folder during hg cloning so that give attacker a chance to modify the config file and lead to command execution.  This one i firstly reported to sourcetree but later i found the root cause was on the mercurial side,so i decided to double report it here. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c1)  Zhang Tianqi    2017-11-03 02:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1984](attachment.cgi?id=1984 "evil poc hg repo to test this issue.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1984&action=edit "evil poc hg repo to test this issue.") evil poc hg repo to test this issue. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c2)  Gregory Szorc    2017-11-03 03:14 UTC  ``` Thank you for reporting the problem. It is being looked at.  Given the potential security implications of this bug report, we'll likely be quiet until more is known.  Also, when reporting potential security bugs to *any* project, please try to avoid disclosing the issue on public forums (like this bug tracker) until the issue is addressed. Disclosing before a fix is ready gives more time to bad actors to exploit the problem before the good actors can fix it, release it, and install the fix. It also creates chaos on the good actors to fix the problem in an overly expedient manner in order to minimize potential impact. This can result in incomplete fixes and longer exposure to the issue. Not to mention it is highly disruptive for everyone involved. Search for "responsible disclosure" to learn more.  For the Mercurial project, instructions for responsible security disclosure are at <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/SecurityDisclosureProcess> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c3)  HG Bot    2017-11-07 13:25 UTC  ``` Fixed by <https://mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/071cbeba4212> Yuya Nishihara <yuya@tcha.org> subrepo: disallow symlink traversal across subrepo mount point (SEC)  It wasn't easy to extend the pathauditor to check symlink traversal across subrepos because pathauditor._checkfs() rejects a directory having ".hg" directory. That's why I added the explicit islink() check.  No idea if this patch is necessary after we've fixed the issue5730 by splitting submerge() into planning and execution phases.  (please test the fix) ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c4)  HG Bot    2017-11-07 13:25 UTC  ``` Fixed by <https://mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/5e27afeddaee> Yuya Nishihara <yuya@tcha.org> subrepo: add config option to reject any subrepo operations (SEC)  This is an alternative workaround for the issue5730.  Perhaps this is the simplest way of disabling subrepo operations. It does nothing clever, but just aborts if Mercurial starts accessing to a subrepo.  I think Greg's patch is more useful since it allows us to at least check out the parent repository. However, that would be confusing if the default is flipped to checkout=False and subrepos are silently ignored.  I don't like the config name 'allowed', but I couldn't get any better name.  (please test the fix) ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c5)  Bugzilla    2017-11-15 00:00 UTC  ``` Bug was set to TESTING for 7 days, resolving ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c6)  Zhang Tianqi    2017-11-30 00:38 UTC  ``` Is this issue has been fixed? And can i request a cve id and a disclosure?  Thanks. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=5730#c7)  Gregory Szorc    2017-11-30 21:26 UTC  ``` This was fixed in Mercurial 4.4.1. <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_4.4.1_.282017-11-07.29>  Also, this bug has been public since the second it was filed. The vulnerability has been disclosed. Mercurial's various mailing lists (including its security announce list) were notified of this issue shortly after this bug was reported and after a release with a fix was made. ``` |  |

Package        : mercurial
Version        : 3.1.2-2+deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-17458

The fix for arbitrary code execution documented in CVE-2017-17458 was
incomplete in the previous upload. A more exhaustive change was
implemented upstream and completely disables non-Mercurial
subrepositories unless users changed the subrepos.allowed setting.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
3.1.2-2+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

            Bug ID: 5730
           Summary: [CRITICAL]Arbitrary command execution in mercurial
                    repo with a git submodule
           Product: Mercurial
           Version: stable branch
          Hardware: All
                OS: All
            Status: UNCONFIRMED
          Severity: bug
          Priority: wish
         Component: Mercurial
          Assignee: [bugzilla at mercurial-scm.org](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/mailman/listinfo/mercurial-devel)
          Reporter: [pnigos at live.com](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/mailman/listinfo/mercurial-devel)
                CC: [mercurial-devel at mercurial-scm.org](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/mailman/listinfo/mercurial-devel)

I found that using hg to track a crafted mercurial repo with a git submodule
can lead to command execution on user's OS.

The root cause is that hg support to add a git submodule to a hg repo.And so
that i can use hg to track .git directory and thus modify the git config file
from the remote.I use ext helper protocol as a poc.I can modify the git config
file to allow ext helper protocol which has been disallowed in the lastest
version of git and then when victim do anything on the evil git submodule,ext
protocol will be triggered and execute the os command.

Here is the reproduction steps:
1.Create a hg repo;
2.Create a git repo and make a commit to it.(The commit is a must.)
3.Now let us use hg to make a crafted hg repo first.
4.Using hg to checkout the hg repo and then add that git repo as it's
submodule.
5.Modify the ./hgrepo/gitsubmodule/.git/config to sth like:

[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = true
    bare = false
    logallrefupdates = true
    ignorecase = true
    precomposeunicode = true
[remote "pwn2own"]
    url = ext::whoami
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master
[protocol]
    allow = always
I modify two parts,change the remote url to "ext::whoami" and add a protocol
section to allow ext protocol to be used.

Then commit all above changes and push to the remote.

When other victim using hg command to clone that crafted repo and
pull,fetch,checkout,push,etc in the git submodule.Our command will be
executed.As we already can control the git config file on the remote,lots of
options we can use to execute command or do other things.

Mercurial accidently cover the .git folder with user applied .git folder during
hg cloning so that give attacker a chance to modify the config file and lead to
command execution.

This one i firstly reported to sourcetree but later i found the root cause was
on the mercurial side,so i decided to double report it here.

Package        : mercurial
Version        : 3.1.2-2+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-9462 CVE-2017-17458 CVE-2018-1000132
Debian Bug     : 861243 892964 901050

Some security vulnerabilities were found in Mercurial which allow
authenticated users to trigger arbitrary code execution and
unauthorized data access in certain server configuration. Malformed
patches and repositories can also lead to crashes and arbitrary code
execution on clients.

CVE-2017-9462

    In Mercurial before 4.1.3, "hg serve --stdio" allows remote
    authenticated users to launch the Python debugger, and
    consequently execute arbitrary code, by using --debugger as a
    repository name.

CVE-2017-17458

    In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially
    malformed repository can cause Git subrepositories to run
    arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script
    checked into the repository. Typical use of Mercurial prevents
    construction of such repositories, but they can be created
    programmatically.

CVE-2018-1000132

    Mercurial version 4.5 and earlier contains a Incorrect Access
    Control (CWE-285) vulnerability in Protocol server that can result
    in Unauthorized data access. This attack appear to be exploitable
    via network connectivity. This vulnerability appears to have been
    fixed in 4.5.1.

OVE-20180430-0001

    mpatch: be more careful about parsing binary patch data

OVE-20180430-0002

    mpatch: protect against underflow in mpatch_apply

OVE-20180430-0004

    mpatch: ensure fragment start isn't past the end of orig

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.1.2-2+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.

Debian Bug     : 901050 892964 927674

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mercurial, an easy-to-use,
scalable distributed version control system.

CVE-2017-17458

    In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially
    malformed repository can cause Git subrepositories to run
    arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script
    checked into the repository. Typical use of Mercurial prevents
    construction of such repositories, but they can be created
    programmatically.

CVE-2018-13346

    The mpatch_apply function in mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1
    incorrectly proceeds in cases where the fragment start is past the
    end of the original data.

CVE-2018-13347

    mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1 mishandles integer addition and
    subtraction.

CVE-2018-13348

    The mpatch_decode function in mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1
    mishandles certain situations where there should be at least 12
    bytes remaining after the current position in the patch data, but
    actually are not.

CVE-2018-1000132

    Mercurial version 4.5 and earlier contains a Incorrect Access
    Control (CWE-285) vulnerability in Protocol server that can result
    in Unauthorized data access. This attack appear to be exploitable
    via network connectivity. This vulnerability appears to have been
    fixed in 4.5.1.

CVE-2019-3902

    Symbolic links and subrepositories could be used defeat Mercurial's
    path-checking logic and write files outside the repository root.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.0-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# An open source Git extension for versioning large files

Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.

[Download v3.6.1 (Windows)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-windows-v3.6.1.exe)

[Download v3.6.1 (Mac - Intel Silicon)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-darwin-amd64-v3.6.1.zip)

[Download v3.6.1 (Mac - Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-darwin-arm64-v3.6.1.zip)

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh): `brew install git-lfs`

[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):    `port install git-lfs`

[Install v3.6.1 via PackageCloud (Linux)](https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/install)

[Download v3.6.1 (Linux - x86-64)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-linux-amd64-v3.6.1.tar.gz)

## How it works:

![a diagram showing how Git LFS works](/images/graphic.gif)

[Git LFS security update: All users should update to 3.6.1.](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q6r2-x2cc-vrp7)

## Getting Started

1. Download and install the Git command line extension. Once downloaded and installed, set up Git LFS for your user account by running:

   ```
   git lfs install
   ```

   You only need to run this once per user account.
2. In each Git repository where you want to use Git LFS, select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

   ```
   git lfs track "*.psd"
   ```

   Now make sure .gitattributes is tracked:

   ```
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

   Note that defining the file types Git LFS should track will not, by itself, convert any pre-existing files to Git LFS, such as files on other branches or in your prior commit history. To do that, use the [git lfs migrate(1)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate.adoc?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=doc_man_migrate_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs) command, which has a range of options designed to suit various potential use cases.
3. There is no step three. Just commit and push as you normally would; for instance, if your current branch is named `main`:

   ```

   git add file.psd
   git commit -m "Add design file"
   git push origin main
   ```

   Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=wiki_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs), [discussion forum](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=discussions_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs), and [documentation](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/tree/main/docs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=docs_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs) for help with any questions you might have!

## Git LFS is an open source project

To start a discussion, file an issue, or contribute to the project, head over [to the repository](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=repo_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs)
or read our [guide to contributing](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=contributing_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs).

If you're interested in integrating Git LFS into another tool or product, you might want to read the
[API specification](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/api/README.md?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=api_spec_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs)
or check out our [reference server implementation](https://github.com/git-lfs/lfs-test-server?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=reference_servedr&utm_campaign=gitlfs).

## Features

* ### Large file versioning

  Version large files—even those as large as a couple GB in size—with Git.
* ### More repository space

  Host more in your Git repositories. External file storage makes it easy to keep your repository at a manageable size.
* ### Faster cloning and fetching

  Download less data. This means faster cloning and fetching from repositories that deal with large files.
* ### Same Git workflow

  Work like you always do on Git—no need for additional commands, secondary storage systems, or toolsets.
* ### Same access controls and permissions

  Keep the same access controls and permissions for large files as the rest of your Git repository when working with a remote host like GitHub.
