  "CVE-2017-17790": {
    "description": "The lazy_initialize function in lib/resolv.rb in Ruby through 2.4.3 uses Kernel#open, which might allow Command Injection attacks, as demonstrated by a Resolv::Hosts::new argument beginning with a '|' character, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-17405.
