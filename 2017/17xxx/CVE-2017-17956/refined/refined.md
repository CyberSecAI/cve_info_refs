The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the "PHP Multivendor Ecommerce" application, but none of them are related to CVE-2017-17956. The vulnerabilities described are:

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Vulnerability:**  Reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist in multiple `*.php` pages, specifically in the `chid1`, `usid`, `cusid`, and `fid` parameters.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied data in URL parameters.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that can execute in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting to malicious websites.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Malicious URLs containing XSS payloads, which an attacker could trick a user into clicking via a phishing email or a compromised website.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create and distribute malicious URLs.

**2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability exists in the `sellerupd.php` page, specifically within the `companyname` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application stores user-controlled input without sanitization and renders it without proper escaping, allowing persistent script injection.
*   **Impact:**  When an administrative user views the seller information, the stored script executes, which could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to use POST parameters to inject the malicious script into the company name field.
*    **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to access an administrative interface and modify a seller's profile

**3. SQL Injection**

*   **Vulnerability:**  SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in `seller-view.php`, `shopping-cart.php`, and `my_wishlist.php` pages via parameters like `usid`, `cusid`, and `fid`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input sanitization when building SQL queries using URL parameters.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to database content or modify data.
*   **Attack vectors:**  By manipulating the parameters in the URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Basic knowledge of SQL injection and the ability to craft malicious URLs.

**4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Vulnerability:**  The `sellerupd.php` endpoint is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of CSRF tokens or other protections.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions, like changing sensitive seller settings.
*  **Attack vectors:** By creating a crafted HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in user, sends a malicious request to change seller information.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft an HTML page and to induce a logged-in user to visit the page.

**5. Arbitrary Account Binding**

*   **Vulnerability:**  Account activation URLs are predictable.
*   **Weaknesses:** Using a predictable ID in the activation URL, allowing an attacker to arbitrarily activate and bind an account to any email address.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can potentially take over user accounts or cause disruption by binding them to attacker-controlled emails.
*   **Attack vectors:** Enumerating or guessing the base64 encoded `eqid` value.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to make web requests to the registration URL with a modified `eqid` value.

**Conclusion:**

This content describes multiple security vulnerabilities within the PHP Multivendor Ecommerce application (Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, and arbitrary account binding). However, none of these are related to the CVE-2017-17956.
