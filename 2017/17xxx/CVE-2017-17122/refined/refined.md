Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `dump_relocs_in_section` function within the `objdump` utility of the binutils package.
- The overflow occurs during the processing of relocations in a malformed Portable Executable (PE) file.
- Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `coff_slurp_reloc_table` function, which is called by `dump_relocs_in_section`. A large number of relocations within a section in a crafted PE file can cause `coff_slurp_reloc_table` to attempt to allocate a large amount of memory without proper checks, which leads to the heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Insufficient validation of relocation count before memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the `objdump` utility.
- The crash is caused by memory corruption due to the heap overflow.
- The `malloc_printerr` is triggered as a result of the double free or corruption of the heap memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted PE file to the `objdump` utility with the `-x` option, forcing the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PE file to the victim.
- The user must execute `objdump` with the `-x` option on the crafted PE file.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The provided bug report includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) that triggers the crash.
- The crash occurs in the `coff_slurp_reloc_table` function when processing relocations of the malformed file.
- The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output confirms a heap-buffer-overflow in the `coff_slurp_reloc_table` function.
- A patch was created to address the vulnerability by adding checks on the section's relocation count before allocating memory.
- Gentoo Linux has marked versions of `binutils` prior to 2.30-r2 as vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
