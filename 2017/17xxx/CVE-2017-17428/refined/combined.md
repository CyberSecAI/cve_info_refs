# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.3 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.3 |

Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.         Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following products:         *Cisco Cloud Hosted Services*   + Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS)   + Cisco Spark   + Cisco Umbrella   *Network Application, Service, and Acceleration*   + Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS)   *Network and Content Security Devices*   + Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) - All models not listed in the Vulnerable Products section   + Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall Services   + Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)   + Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)   + Cisco Firepower 2100 Series   + Cisco Firepower 4100 Series   + Cisco Firepower 7000 Series   + Cisco Firepower 8000 Series   + Cisco Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)   + Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)   *Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider*   + Cisco VPN Internal Service Module for ISR (VPN ISM)  Details  * Bleichenbacher's attack is an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack against RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption block formatting. Daniel Bleichenbacher originally performed this attack against the RSA key exchange on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Version 3.0.      The attack relies on the presence of a side channel indicating, for any chosen ciphertext, whether the corresponding plaintext has the correct format according to the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 standard. An attacker could exploit this side channel as an oracle, iteratively constructing crafted TLS messages. Eventually the attacker might be able to recover the plaintext for a given TLS session.      The new research focused on identifying current TLS implementations affected by the classic Bleichenbacher attack or those affected by newly introduced variations. These new variations use the overall TCP connection state as a possible side channel and use a nonstandard, abbreviated TLS message flow.      The following vulnerabilities were identified based on this research:**Cavium SSL SDK Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of Cavium SSL Software Development Kits (SDKs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-17428.  **Legacy Cisco ASA 5500 Series Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of legacy Cisco ASA 5500 Series (ASA 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, and 5550) devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.      This vulnerability affects the listed ASA models when they are using a 2048-bit RSA key.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-12373.  **SSL Visibility Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of Cisco SSL Appliance (Bluecoat SSL Visibility OEM appliance) could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures   against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for   key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending   crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and   allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.  This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-15533.  Workarounds  * Disabling use of TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange is a possible mitigation for these vulnerabilities. It is applicable only to products that support other types of ciphers, such as those based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This mitigation may have an impact on interoperability with legacy clients that do not support these ciphers. This mitigation is not applicable to Cisco Application Control Engine (ACE).      For potential workarounds on a specific Cisco product, refer to the relevant Cisco bug, which is available from the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID).

## TLS implementations may disclose side channel information via discrepancies between valid and invalid PKCS#1 padding

#### Vulnerability Note VU#144389

Original Release Date: 2017-12-12 | Last Revised: 2018-04-09

---

### Overview

TLS implementations may disclose side channel information via discrepancies between valid and invalid PKCS#1 padding, and may therefore be vulnerable to Bleichenbacher-style attacks. This attack is known as a "ROBOT attack".

### Description

| [**CWE-203**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html)**: Information Exposure Through Discrepancy**  Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a mechanism for a security transport over network connections, and is defined in RFC 5246. TLS may utilize RSA cryptography to secure the connection, and section 7.4.7 describes how client and server may exchange keys. Implementations that don't closely follow the descriptions in RFC 5246 may leak information to an attacker when they handle PKCS #1 v1.5 padding errors in ways that lets the attacker distinguish between valid and invalid messages. An attacker may utilize discrepancies in TLS error messages to obtain the pre-master secret key private RSA key used by TLS to decrypt sensitive data. This type of attack has become known as a [Bleichenbacher attack](http://archiv.infsec.ethz.ch/education/fs08/secsem/bleichenbacher98.pdf). CERT/CC previously published CERT Advisory [CA-1998-07](https://www.cert.org/historical/advisories/CA-1998-07.cfm) for this type of attack.  Some modern cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to Bleichenbacher-style attacks on TLS. While [RFC 5246 Section 7.4.7.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.7.1) provides advice in order to eliminate discrepancies and defend against Bleichenbacher attacks, implementation-specific error and exception handling may nevertheless re-introduce message discrepancies that act as a cryptographic oracle for a Bleichenbacher-style attack.  More information about the research and affected vendors is available from the [researcher's website](https://robotattack.org/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to obtain the TLS pre-master secret (TLS session key) and decrypt TLS traffic. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Disable TLS RSA**Affected users and system administrators are encouraged to disable TLS RSA cyphers if possible. Please refer to your product's documentation or contact the vendor's customer service.**Apply an update**Some products may have software updates available to address this issue. If an update is available, affected users are encouraged to update product software or firmware. Please see the Affected Vendors list below for more information.**Note for developers**[RFC 5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.7.1) contains remediation advice for Bleichenbacher-style attacks. Developers are encouraged to review the advice and ensure implementations of TLS or software that utilizes a TLS library does not introduce further message or timing discrepancies that may be used in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. |

### [Legion of the Bouncy Castle](#CHEU-AT5U7K) Affected

Notified:  November 15, 2017  Updated: December 12, 2017

**Statement Date:   December 12, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

BouncyCastle TLS servers, when configured to use the JCE (Java
Cryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions, contained a weak
Bleichenbacher oracle when any TLS cipher suite using RSA key exchange
was negotiated. This specifically includes servers using the BCJSSE
provider in its default configuration.

Affected software:
bctls-fips-1.0.2.jar and earlier versions
bctls-jdk15on-1.58.jar and earlier versions

Note that the older TLS implementation (in the
org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls package) is not vulnerable.

For FIPS users, the issue is fixed in
bctls-fips-1.0.3.jar

We recommend all FIPS users upgrade as soon as possible.

For the regular API, version 1.59 containing the fix is expected to be
available before the end of 2017. In the meantime, beta versions
beginning with 1.59b09 contain the fix, and are available from
<https://downloads.bouncycastle.org/betas/> . We recommend users upgrade
immediately to
bctls-jdk15on-159b09.jar

and then upgrade to the full 1.59 release as soon as it is available. If
continuing to deploy vulnerable versions, we strongly recommend
disabling TLS cipher suites that use RSA key exchange.
