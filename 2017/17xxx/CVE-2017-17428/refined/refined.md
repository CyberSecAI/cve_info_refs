Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17428:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack in the TLS protocol implementation of Cavium SSL Software Development Kits (SDKs). Specifically, the issue lies in the way the SDK handles PKCS#1 v1.5 padding errors when using RSA for key exchange.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bleichenbacher Attack:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to the Bleichenbacher attack, which is a chosen-ciphertext attack against RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption. The implementation allows an attacker to differentiate between valid and invalid padding in TLS messages by observing side channel information (e.g., error messages or timing discrepancies). This effectively turns the affected system into an oracle.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of TLS Traffic:** An attacker can recover the pre-master secret key used for TLS session, allowing them to decrypt the TLS traffic.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** By decrypting the TLS traffic, an attacker can access potentially confidential information transmitted over the network, such as passwords, session cookies, or proprietary data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
*   **Crafted TLS Messages:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending specially crafted TLS messages to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is required to perform the attack.
*   **Ability to Send TLS Messages:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted TLS messages to the target device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is one of several related to the Bleichenbacher attack, which was rediscovered in 2017 affecting various TLS implementations.
*   The vulnerability is present in Cavium SSL SDKs and impacts products that utilize these SDKs.
*   The provided information from Cisco also mentions that this vulnerability is tracked under CVE-2017-17428, which is caused by improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack in Cavium SSL SDK.
*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note VU#144389 provides a broad overview of the vulnerability class and lists Cisco ACE as affected by CVE-2017-17428.
*   A possible workaround is disabling TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange, where it's possible, however, this isn't always practical as it may impact compatibility.
