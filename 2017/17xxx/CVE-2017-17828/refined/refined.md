The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in a "Bus Booking Script", including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**SQL Injection:**
*   **Root cause:** Improper input sanitization in `view_seatseller.php` and `view_member.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can obtain sensitive data, such as database user and version information.
*   **Attack vectors:** Crafted URL parameters in `sp_id` and `memid`.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and SQL syntax.

**XSS (Reflected):**
*   **Root cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in `results.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Reflected XSS vulnerability.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attack vectors:** Crafted URL parameter in `datepicker`.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to craft a malicious URL and get the victim to click on it.

**XSS (Stored):**
*   **Root cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in `new_master.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the affected data.
*   **Attack vectors:** Malicious POST parameters in `spemail` field when creating a new service provider.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to craft a malicious POST request.

**CSRF:**
*   **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in `new_master.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** CSRF vulnerability, which enables an attacker to perform state-changing actions in the victim's web application.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to unknowingly perform actions, such as injecting XSS payloads.
*   **Attack vectors:** A crafted HTML page with a form that submits malicious data to the vulnerable `new_master.php` page.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page.
