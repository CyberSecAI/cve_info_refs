The provided content relates to CVE-2017-17774.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF protection in the Piwigo admin panel, specifically in the album properties page, and the lack of proper sanitization of user input leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF: The admin panel lacks CSRF protection, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an admin user without their knowledge.
- Stored XSS: User-supplied input is not sanitized before being stored and displayed, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can combine CSRF and XSS to execute arbitrary code within the context of an administrator's session. This allows the attacker to:
- Modify album settings.
- Potentially gain full control of the Piwigo instance.
- Steal sensitive information, including administrator cookies and session details.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page hosted on an external site.
- This page contains a form that submits a crafted request to the Piwigo admin panel (album properties page) using the POST method.
- The form includes malicious JavaScript code within the album name field.
- The attacker tricks an administrator to visit the malicious page.
- The admin's browser, upon loading the evil page, automatically submits the form, executing a CSRF attack.
- When the administrator visits the album page, the stored XSS is triggered, and the attacker's code executes in the context of the admin session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage on an external site.
- The attacker needs to trick an admin user into visiting the attacker controlled webpage.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to the Piwigo instance.
