  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-17848",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to flaws in the handling of emails with contradicting or unusual data structures in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). It also includes issues related to how email clients handle MIME wrapping, especially partially signed messages, and weaknesses in the binding of signed messages to the sender identity. Additionally, it includes UI redressing attacks where clients are tricked by mimicking UI elements.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of contradicting data structures in CMS",
        "MIME wrapping attacks exploiting handling of partially signed messages",
        "Weaknesses in binding signed messages to sender identity",
         "Vulnerabilities to UI redressing attacks (mimicking of UI elements)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to spoofing of digital signatures for arbitrary messages, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity of emails. This can also result in plain text leaks and denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Crafting emails with contradicting data structures in CMS",
         "Exploiting MIME wrapping vulnerabilities",
         "Manipulating sender identities in emails to spoof signatures",
         "Using HTML, CSS, or other embedded content to mimic UI elements"

      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft emails with specific content and manipulate MIME structures. It does not target the cryptographic primitives of digital signatures themselves, but rather weaknesses in their implementation."
