# OpenPGP and S/MIME signature forgery attacks in multiple email clients

---

*From*: Jens M√ºller via Fulldisclosure <fulldisclosure () seclists org>

*Date*: Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:33:59 +0200

```
In the scope of academic research at Ruhr-University Bochum and M√ºnster
University of Applied Sciences, Germany, various vulnerabilities
regarding the signature verification logic in OpenPGP and S/MIME capable
email clients have been discovered.

While neither OpenPGP nor S/MIME are directly affected, email client
implementations show a poor performance. Popular clients such as Apple
Mail or Thunderbird are vulnerable to signature spoofing on multiple
layers (attack classes).

*Abstract:*

OpenPGP and S/MIME are the two major standards to encrypt and digitally
sign emails. Digital signatures are supposed to guarantee authenticity
and integrity of messages. In this work we show practical forgery
attacks against various implementations of OpenPGP and S/MIME email
signature verification in five attack classes: (1) We analyze edge cases
in S/MIME's container format. (2) We exploit in-band signaling in the
GnuPG API, the most widely used OpenPGP implementation. (3) We apply
MIME wrapping attacks that abuse the email clients' handling of
partially signed messages. (4) We analyze weaknesses in the binding of
signed messages to the sender identity. (5) We systematically test email
clients for UI redressing attacks.

Our attacks allow the spoofing of digital signatures for arbitrary
messages in 14 out of 20 tested OpenPGP-capable email clients and 15 out
of 22 email clients supporting S/MIME signatures. While the attacks do
not target the underlying cryptographic primitives of digital
signatures, they raise concerns about the actual security of OpenPGP and
S/MIME email applications. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to
counter these attacks.

*Affected clients:*

The following email clients -- with S/MIME support or PGP plugins --
are fully or partially vulnerable. While most issues are patched now,
some email clients remain vulnerable, especially to minor issues.

Thunderbird (52.5.2), Outlook/GpgOL (16.0.4266), The Bat! (8.2.0), eM
Client (7.1.31849), Postbox (5.0.20), KMail (5.2.3), Evolution (3.22.6),
Trojit√° (0.7-278), Apple Mail (11.2), MailMate (1.10), Airmail (3.5.3),
K-9 Mail (5.403), R2Mail2 (2.30), MailDroid (4.81), Nine (4.1.3a),
Roundcube (1.3.4), Mailpile (1.0.0rc2)

*Resulting CVEs:*

CVE-2018-18509, CVE-2018-12019, CVE-2018-12020, CVE-2017-17848,
CVE-2018-15586, CVE-2018-15587, CVE-2018-15588, CVE-2019-8338,

[![Forged PGP signature of Phil Zimmermann](/RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired/raw/master/assets/forged.png)](/RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired/blob/master/assets/forged.png)

### Abstract

OpenPGP and S/MIME are the two major standards to encrypt and digitally sign emails. Digital signatures are supposed to guarantee authenticity and integrity of messages. In this work we show practical forgery attacks against various implementations of OpenPGP and S/MIME email signature verification in five attack classes: (1) We analyze edge cases in S/MIME's container format. (2) We exploit in-band signaling in the GnuPG API, the most widely used OpenPGP implementation. (3) We apply MIME wrapping attacks that abuse the email clients' handling of partially signed messages. (4) We analyze weaknesses in the binding of signed messages to the sender identity. (5) We systematically test email clients for UI redressing attacks.

Our attacks allow the spoofing of digital signatures for arbitrary messages in 14 out of 20 tested OpenPGP-capable email clients and 15 out of 22 email clients supporting S/MIME signatures. While the attacks do not target the underlying cryptographic primitives of digital signatures, they raise concerns about the actual security of OpenPGP and S/MIME email applications. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to counter these attacks.

### Attack classes

1. **CMS attacks.** Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is a versatile standard for signed and encrypted messages within the X.509 public-key infrastructure. We found flaws in the handling of emails with contradicting or unusual data structures.
2. **GPG API attacks.** GnuPG is the most widely used OpenPGP implementation, but it only offers a very restricted command line interface for validating signatures. This interface was vulnerable to injection attacks.
3. **MIME attacks.** The body of an email is conceptually a MIME *tree*, but typically the tree has only one leaf which is signed. We construct non-standard MIME trees that trick clients into showing an unsigned text while verifying an unrelated signature in another part.
4. **ID attacks.** The goal of this attack class is to display a valid signature from the identity (ID) of a trusted communication partner located in the mail header, although the crafted email is actually signed by the attacker.
5. **UI attacks.** Email clients indicate a valid signature by showing some security indicators in the user interface (UI), for example, a letter with a seal. However, several clients allow the mimicking of important UI elements by using HTML, CSS, and other embedded content.
