- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input in the URL parameter is directly used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted URL containing malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web application.
