# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201811-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.30-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.30-r2** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial of
Service condition or have other unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.30-r2"

```

If the problem persists, please could you post an updated address sanitizer output, since the code in bfd/elf.c has been edited recently.

Those symbols are not full elf symbols so the cast to elf_symbol_type is wrong. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=22443#c3)  Nick Clifton    2017-11-17 12:28:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10608](attachment.cgi?id=10608&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10608&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Hi Guys,  In which case, please can someone try out this patch and let me know if it fixes the problem ?

Ah, right - we need to check the symbol type as well as the file type to see if it is a non-ELF symbol.  Please try this latest version of the patch and let me know if it works this time.

They can appear on relocs and perhaps other places     in an ELF bfd, so a number of places in nm.c and objdump.c are wrong     to cast an asymbol based on the bfd being ELF.  I think we lose     nothing by excluding all section symbols, not just the global_syms.
