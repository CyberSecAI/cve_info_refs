**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

**Analysis:**

The provided content, particularly the bug report from sourceware.org, reveals that CVE-2017-17125 is related to a global buffer overflow vulnerability in the `_bfd_elf_get_symbol_version_string` function within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library of GNU Binutils.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because the `_bfd_elf_get_symbol_version_string` function incorrectly casts non-ELF symbol types (specifically, section symbols like `*ABS*` which are part of the `global_syms` array) to `elf_symbol_type`. This incorrect casting leads to out-of-bounds memory access when trying to retrieve the symbol version string.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Global Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a global buffer overflow that occurs when processing a corrupted ELF file, leading to out-of-bounds reads. This can be triggered by passing a crafted ELF file to `objdump`.
    *   **Incorrect Type Casting:** The root cause is incorrect casting of non-ELF symbols, causing the code to dereference invalid memory locations.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As stated in the Gentoo advisory, the primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, since the out-of-bounds access results in program termination by the address sanitizer. Other unspecified impacts are also possible.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Specially Crafted ELF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a maliciously crafted ELF file.
    *   **Command-Line Tool:** The `objdump` command-line utility is specifically mentioned as the tool that triggers the vulnerability, where a crafted ELF file is passed as an argument, through a command such as "./objdump -x $POC".

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Supply Malicious Input:** An attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted ELF file to a user who then uses a vulnerable version of `binutils` (specifically, `objdump`) to process it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Mingi Cho and Taekyoung Kwon of Yonsei University.
*   The bug report includes a proof-of-concept (POC) file and several proposed patches.
*   The fix involves checking the symbol type before attempting to access the version string and exclude section symbols (not only global_syms) when accessing symbol version strings.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `bfd/elf.c` at line 1838.
*   The Gentoo advisory indicates that versions of `sys-devel/binutils` prior to `2.30-r2` are affected by this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-17125 is a global buffer overflow in `binutils` caused by incorrect handling of symbol types when processing ELF files. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, triggered by a specially crafted ELF file via the `objdump` utility.
