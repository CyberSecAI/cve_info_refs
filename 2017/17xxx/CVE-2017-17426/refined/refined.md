The content is related to CVE-2017-17426.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in `malloc` when the per-thread cache (tcache) is enabled. Specifically, the `request2size` macro, used to calculate the chunk size from the requested allocation size, does not perform an overflow check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow in the `request2size` macro within the `malloc` implementation in glibc.
- When a very large allocation size is requested (close to `SIZE_MAX`), the integer overflow causes `malloc` to incorrectly return a cached pointer from the tcache, instead of `NULL` which indicates a failed allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A program requesting a very large allocation may receive a pointer to previously freed memory. This could lead to memory corruption, unexpected behavior, or potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Calling `malloc` with a very large size close to `SIZE_MAX`, specifically values between `(size_t)~0-23` and `(size_t)~0`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control the size argument passed to `malloc`.
- No special privileges or specific network position are required to trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability exists within the glibc library.
