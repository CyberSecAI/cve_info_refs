Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-17525:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `guiclient/guiclient.cpp` file of xTuple PostBooks 4.7.0. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate strings before using them to launch a program specified by the `BROWSER` environment variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Argument Injection:** The primary weakness is the possibility of injecting arbitrary arguments into the command line of the program launched using the BROWSER variable. This is due to the lack of validation of the URL passed to the `guiclient.cpp` code which uses the `BROWSER` environment variable to launch an application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can inject arguments, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This could result in a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that, when processed by xTuple PostBooks, triggers the vulnerable code. The crafted URL contains injected arguments for the program launched by the `BROWSER` environment variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted URL to the application (xTuple PostBooks) . The attacker does not need to be physically present on the victim's machine.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the crafted URL in some way to trigger the vulnerability. This could involve clicking a link or opening a document containing the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is described as having a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.
- The attack vector is network-based and has low complexity.
- No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, but user interaction is necessary.
- The vulnerability impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

This vulnerability is present in the following Ubuntu versions:
- 18.04 LTS bionic
- 16.04 LTS xenial
