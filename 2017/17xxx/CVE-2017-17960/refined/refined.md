The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in a PHP Multivendor Ecommerce application, but none of them are related to a vulnerability with the ID CVE-2017-17960.

The vulnerabilities detailed are:
- **Reflected XSS:** Multiple instances in `category.php`, `seller-view.php`, `shopping-cart.php`, and `my_wishlist.php` due to insufficient input sanitization in the `chid1`, `usid`, `cusid`, and `fid` parameters.
- **Stored XSS:** In `admin/sellerupd.php`, an attacker can inject malicious code via the `companyname` parameter.
- **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances in `seller-view.php`, `shopping-cart.php`, and `my_wishlist.php`, due to unsanitized `usid`, `cusid`, and `fid` parameters, respectively.
- **CSRF:** An attacker can induce a logged-in admin to unknowingly perform actions via a crafted form targeting `admin/sellerupd.php`, potentially leading to changes in settings or injection of stored XSS.
- **Arbitrary Account Binding:** The activation URL for new accounts in `sign-in.php` uses predictable `eqid` values (base64 encoded integers), enabling an attacker to activate an account for an arbitrary email address without needing to control the email address.

Therefore, the response is: UNRELATED
