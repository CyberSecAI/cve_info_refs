- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before using them to construct SQL queries within the handling of NVBUPhaseStatus Get method requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via network requests to the NVBUPhaseStatus Get method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated.
