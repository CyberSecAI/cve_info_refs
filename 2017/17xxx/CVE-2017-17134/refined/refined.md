- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient checks on specially crafted XML files by the XML parser in certain Huawei products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A lack of proper validation of XML files leading to a null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful attack can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated local attacker needs to craft and upload a malicious XML file to the affected product and then parse it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the affected product and must be able to authenticate.
