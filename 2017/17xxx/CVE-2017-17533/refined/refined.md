```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `default.tcl` script in Tkabber 1.1 does not properly validate strings before using them to launch a program specified by the BROWSER environment variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Argument injection vulnerability",
	  "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers could potentially inject malicious arguments into the command used to launch the browser, leading to arbitrary command execution or other unintended behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted URL that contains malicious arguments when used by the application to launch a browser",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted URL that is then handled by the vulnerable application to launch a browser. The attacker would also need to have control of the BROWSER environment variable to execute the injected command"
  },
  "additional_details": "It's important to note that a third party has disputed this vulnerability, stating that the Tcl `exec` function performs its own argument parsing, preventing command injection. MITRE also considers this as DISPUTED rather than REJECTED."
