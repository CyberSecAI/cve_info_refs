Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is related to how ImageMagick handles certain malformed image files, specifically within the `ReadPICTImage` function. This leads to memory leaks when processing these malformed files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leaks in the `ReadPICTImage` function. The issue manifests as both direct and indirect memory leaks. 
- The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick attempts to process a specially crafted or malformed image file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service:** By repeatedly triggering the memory leak, an attacker could cause the application to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Possible code execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice also mentions the possibility of code execution, but this is not explicitly detailed in the github issue.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves providing a specially crafted image file to ImageMagick for processing. This file would exploit the vulnerability in the `ReadPICTImage` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to supply a specially crafted image file to an application using the vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could be achieved by:
    -  Tricking a user into opening a malicious image file using an application that utilizes ImageMagick.
    - Exploiting a server-side application that uses ImageMagick to process user-uploaded images.
    - Targeting any other process which uses ImageMagick to handle image files

**Additional Details:**

- The github issue provides a detailed analysis of memory leaks using AddressSanitizer, identifying multiple leaks with specific allocation locations and sizes.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3681-1) confirms that multiple CVEs are related to incorrect handling of malformed image files by ImageMagick, listing CVE-2017-17885 as one of them.
- The Ubuntu notice highlights that this can lead to denial of service or potentially code execution.
- The github issue includes a test case which can reproduce the memory leak.
