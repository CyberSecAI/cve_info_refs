Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17656:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of a user-supplied string within the handling of NVBUBackup JobList method requests. This user-controlled string is used to construct SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the underlying database.
- This implies potential for full system compromise by gaining control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Specifically, through the `NVBUBackup JobList` method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication required.
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable `NVBUBackup JobList` method.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in NVBU 11.4.5.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability with filter ID 28894.
