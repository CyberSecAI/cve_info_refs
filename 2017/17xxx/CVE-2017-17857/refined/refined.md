{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The BPF verifier's `check_stack_boundary()` function did not return an error when a stack pointer didn't have a known offset, leading to a vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing error return in `check_stack_boundary()` when a stack pointer lacks a known offset.",
    "Indirect stack accesses at non-constant addresses were permitted."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain read and write access to spilled stack pointers, potentially leading to memory corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious eBPF program that utilizes stack pointers without known offsets.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to load eBPF programs into the kernel."
