{
  "CVE-2017-17052": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An error path in `dup_mm()` during process forking could lead to a premature freeing of the `exe_file` reference in `mm_struct`. This occurs because a reference to the `exe_file` is not taken before an early return from `dup_mm()`, while the `exe_file` pointer was copied from the parent process. The subsequent `mmput()` in the error path can then decrement a reference count of the `exe_file` that was never incremented in the child process.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A use-after-free vulnerability leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This can result in a kernel crash during exit or fork.",
    "Attack vectors": "Triggering a fork operation concurrently with other operations (like `mmap`) within a process, combined with specific timing of a task being killed while waiting to acquire its `mmap_sem` lock.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the system capable of calling the `fork()` system call. No specific kernel config options are needed."
