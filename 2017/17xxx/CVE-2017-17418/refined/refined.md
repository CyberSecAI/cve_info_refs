Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-17418:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied strings within the handling of "NVBUPolicy Get method" requests. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious code into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application constructs SQL queries using unsanitized user input, allowing attackers to manipulate the queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation enables remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system, specifically in the context of the underlying database. This means attackers can gain full control over the application and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Unauthenticated access: The vulnerability does not require authentication to be exploited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Quest NetVault Backup server.
- No prior authentication is needed to execute the attack.
