- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation when processing IKEv2 messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the inadequate validation of crafted IKEv2 messages received by the affected Huawei products.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to invalid memory access, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected devices.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted IKEv2 messages to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected product and knowledge of IKEv2 protocol. IKEv2 must be configured on the vulnerable device.
