# USN-3539-1: GIMP vulnerabilities

22 January 2018

Several security issues were fixed in GIMP.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [gimp](/security/cves?package=gimp) - The GNU Image Manipulation Program

## Details

It was discovered that GIMP incorrectly handled certain images. If a user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could possibly use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17784](/security/CVE-2017-17784), [CVE-2017-17785](/security/CVE-2017-17785), [CVE-2017-17786](/security/CVE-2017-17786),

[CVE-2017-17787](/security/CVE-2017-17787), [CVE-2017-17788](/security/CVE-2017-17788), [CVE-2017-17789](/security/CVE-2017-17789))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [gimp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gimp)
  -
  [2.8.10-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gimp/2.8.10-0ubuntu1.2)
* [libgimp2.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gimp)
  -
  [2.8.10-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gimp/2.8.10-0ubuntu1.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: GIMP parser bugs (FLIMP and more)

Hi,

See also
<https://flimp.fuzzing-project.org/>

Background: In 2014, back when I started the fuzzing project, I
reported two bugs in GIMP in their more obscure parsers. Recently I was
contacted by Tobias Stöckmann who wrote a working exploit (on freebsd <-
no aslr, thus easier) for one of those bugs in the FLIC parser. He also
submitted a patch.

The bugs were ignored all the time, patches as well.

I reported a couple of more bugs and also contacted the GNOME security
team. Some have patches, others not, ony one got handled. It seems
overall the file format importers are unmaintained.
I also tried to submit a fuzzing guide to the gimp wiki, which failed,
because the people who are supposed to hand out user accounts don't
answer. (gimp is not fuzzing friendly.)

The bugs:

Heap overflow in FLI import (the one where we have an exploit):
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=739133>

OOB read in TGA (with patch)
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=739134>

OOB read in XCF (patch, the only one that got merged and fixed)
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790783>

OOB read in GBR (no patch, looks like string/utf8 issue)
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790784>

Heap overflow in PSP (no patch, doesn't look straightforward to fix)
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790849>

OOB read in PSP (no patch)
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790853>

Debian Bug     : 884836 884837 884862 884925 884927 885347

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program, which could result in denial of service
(application crash) or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if
malformed files are opened.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.8.14-1+deb8u2.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.18-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.

For the detailed security status of gimp please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gimp>

                 CVE-2017-17788 CVE-2017-17789

Hanno Böck found several buffer overflows in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program, which could lead to application crash or other
unspecified behaviour if a user opened untrusted input files.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
2.8.2-2+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=790783#c0)  Hanno BÃ¶ck    2017-11-24 11:39:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 364313](attachment.cgi?id=364313 "sample file triggering overread.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=364313&action=edit "sample file triggering overread.") sample file triggering overread.  I'll attach a file that will cause a stack overread in the XCF file import. This was discovered by fuzzing with american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer. I'll also attach the stack trace from asan. The overread can be detected by compiling gimp with address sanitizer.  The bug is in xcf.c when reading the file version. According to the inofficial XCF spec [1] the version is a string starting at offset 9 with a null terminator at offset 13.  The code in xcf.c assumes that this null terminator is there and passes the version string to atoi. So if you craft a file where it's missing then atoi will overread. This can be fixed by checking that the null terminator is really set to 0 and returning an error if it's not. Patch also attached.
