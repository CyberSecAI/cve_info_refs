- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of parameter validation in some Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information leak vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive information in kernel memory, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must trick a user into installing a malicious application on the smartphone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious application and trick a user into installing it. The attacker must also be on the target device once the malicious app is installed.
