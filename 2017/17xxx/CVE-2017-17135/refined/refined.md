Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE-2017-17135 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Null pointer dereference vulnerability due to insufficient verification in the PEM module.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation. Specifically, the PEM decoder does not sufficiently verify the input parameters.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can cause the system to crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local. The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated local user. The attacker must be logged in as an operator. The attacker needs to call the PEM decoder with a specific, crafted parameter.

**Additional Notes (From the provided content):**

*   This document is part of a larger security advisory which addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the PEM module.
*   The advisory also lists affected products and versions, along with fixed versions.
*   The advisory provides CVSS v3 base and temporal scores for the vulnerabilities. The base score for CVE-2017-17135 is 5.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) indicating local access, low complexity, low privileges required, no user interaction, and high impact to availability.
*   The advisory states that the attacker must be an authenticated local user to exploit the vulnerability
*   The content also mentions other related vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-17136 (Heap overflow), CVE-2017-17137 (Out-of-Bounds memory access), CVE-2017-17138 (DoS) all related to PEM module issues.

This content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description by detailing the specific weakness (null pointer dereference), the necessary attacker position (authenticated local user), the method of exploitation (calling the PEM decoder with a specific parameter), and the impact (DoS).
