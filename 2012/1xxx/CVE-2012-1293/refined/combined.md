Subject: Re: Vulnerabilitites in Debian F*EX <= 20100208 and
 F*EX 20111129-2.

We actually need two CVEs here.

Which components the vulnerabilities are in, is rarely relevant for
deciding how many CVEs to assign.  Much more critical is which versions
are affected.  The original researcher provided two advisories for 2
different versions.  So even though "fup" is affected, we mould need to
SPLIT if there are some items/vectors/issues that affect different
versions than others (hint: we will SPLIT.)

Kurt said:

> Please use CVE-2012-0869 for this issue.

Here are the breakdowns for the two advisories/versions:

F*EX <= 20100208
   fup / from parameter
   fup / to parameter
   fup / id parameter

F*EX 20111129-2
   fup / id parameter

So, based on the original report, we have:

   20100208 only:
     fup / from
     fup / to

   20100208 *and* 20111129-2
     fup / id

So, we MERGE the "fup" and "from" vectors since they affect the same
version, and we SPLIT these from the "id" vector. (For the incredibly
detail-oriented: whether the parameters come via GET or POST methods is
irrelevant for CVE.)

Now, the question is which issue we link with CVE-2012-0869.  Since Debian
bug 660621 focuses on the id parameter, and that paremeter affects both
listed versions, I guess it makes sense to focus CVE-2012-0869 on the id
parameter.

I've assigned CVE-2012-1293 for the "from" and "to" parameters that are
only listed for 20100208.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Vulnerabilitites in Debian F*EX <= 20100208 and F*EX 20111129-2.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Nicola Fioravanti aka muuratsalo | muuratsalo experimental hack lab.
I am writing you because I have discovered some vulnerabilities in
Debian F*EX <= 20100208 (stable) and F*EX 20111129-2. (testing and
unstable)
I have already contacted the Author who confirmed the vulnerabilities
and applied the suggested fixes.
A major update of F*EX  has been released on the 15th of February
2012. The Debian Mantainer of the package is working on it.
Together with the Author we decided not to release any public advisory
before the release of the new Debian package.

I would be grateful if you could assign CVE ids to the discovered issues.

You will find the two advisories as an attachment.

Best regards,
/NF

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

blists is a registered project with

Package        : fex
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0869

Nicola Fioravanti discovered that F*X, a web service for transferring
very large files, is not properly sanitizing input parameters of the "fup"
script.  An attacker can use this flaw to conduct reflected cross-site
scripting attacks via various script parameters.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 20100208+debian1-1+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed
in version 20120215-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your fex packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
