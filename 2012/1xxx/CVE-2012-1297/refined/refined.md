Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `main.php` file of Contao (formerly TYPOlight) versions 2.11.0 and earlier. This allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection in the application. This allows attackers to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated admin, will perform actions on the admin's behalf.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
   - Deletion of administrator or user accounts, potentially including the initial administrator account created during setup.
   - Deletion of news articles, thus affecting the website content.
   - Deletion of newsletters, again affecting site content and communication.
In essence, an attacker can manipulate the system without proper authorization, potentially disrupting services and deleting critical content and user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. An attacker can create a malicious webpage or embed malicious code in an existing website that, when accessed by an authenticated administrator, will send a forged HTTP request to the vulnerable Contao instance. The forged request will trigger the deletion actions specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to entice an authenticated administrator of the Contao system to visit a malicious website, click a malicious link, or load a malicious content that triggers the CSRF attack.
   - The attacker does not need to know the specific administrator's password, just that they are authenticated with the vulnerable Contao CMS at the time of attack.
   - The attacker needs to know the URL and parameters required to trigger the delete functions.
   -  The exploit requires a basic understanding of HTML and form submissions.
   - The attacker can be external, not necessarily on the same network as the vulnerable Contao instance.

**Technical Details from Exploit:**

The provided exploit code snippets illustrate the attack. The attacker creates an HTML page containing a form which is automatically submitted upon page load using JavaScript. This form sends a POST request to the Contao application with the action parameter set to `delete` and the `id` parameter set to the resource the attacker wants to delete:
   - Deleting a user: `/contao/main.php?do=user&act=delete&id=2`
   - Deleting news: `/contao/main.php?do=news&act=delete&id=1`
   - Deleting a newsletter: `/contao/contao/main.php?do=newsletter&act=delete&id=1`
