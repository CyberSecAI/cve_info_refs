  "CVE-2012-1950": {
    "description": "Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated. Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from how Firefox updates the address bar during drag-and-drop events. When a URL is dragged to the address bar and the page load is canceled, the address bar may not reflect the new URL but the previous one.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect address bar update",
      "Failure to update the address bar when the page loading is stopped"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could perform phishing attacks by displaying a false address in the address bar.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Drag-and-drop a URL into the address bar",
      "Canceling page load during a drag and drop event",
       "Using `history.forward` and `history.back` to navigate to a new site"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into dragging the address to the address bar.",
	  "The attacker requires the ability to cancel the page load while dragging and dropping"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be triggered with javascript by calling stop() during the drag and drop event or via an interval.",
