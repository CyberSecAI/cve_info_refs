## Details

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

Matt McCutchen discovered a clickjacking vulnerability in the certificate

warning page. A remote attacker could trick a user into accepting a malicious

certificate via a crafted certificate warning page. ([CVE-2012-1964](/security/CVE-2012-1964))

Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili discovered that javascript was not filtered out

of feed URLs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an

attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks. ([CVE-2012-1965](/security/CVE-2012-1965))

A vulnerability was discovered in the context menu of data: URLs. If the user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2012-1966](/security/CVE-2012-1966))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Firefox. This is a known

  issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be fixed in a

  later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1088)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2012-1948, CVE-2012-1951, CVE-2012-1952, CVE-2012-1953,
CVE-2012-1954, CVE-2012-1958, CVE-2012-1962, CVE-2012-1967)

A malicious web page could bypass same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
and execute arbitrary code with chrome privileges. (CVE-2012-1959)

A flaw in the context menu functionality in Firefox could allow a malicious
website to bypass intended restrictions and allow a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1966)

A page different to that in the address bar could be displayed when
dragging and dropping to the address bar, possibly making it easier for a
malicious site or user to perform a phishing attack. (CVE-2012-1950)

A flaw in the way Firefox called history.forward and history.back could
allow an attacker to conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user
into believing they are viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2012-1955)

A flaw in a parser utility class used by Firefox to parse feeds (such as
RSS) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. This issue could have affected
other browser components or add-ons that assume the class returns
sanitized input. (CVE-2012-1957)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled X-Frame-Options headers could allow a
malicious website to perform a clickjacking attack. (CVE-2012-1961)

A flaw in the way Content Security Policy (CSP) reports were generated by
Firefox could allow a malicious web page to steal a victim's OAuth 2.0
access tokens and OpenID credentials. (CVE-2012-1963)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled certificate warnings could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to create a crafted warning, possibly tricking
a user into accepting an arbitrary certificate as trusted. (CVE-2012-1964)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled feed:javascript URLs could allow output
filtering to be bypassed, possibly leading to a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1965)

The nss update RHBA-2012:0337 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
introduced a mitigation for the CVE-2011-3389 flaw. For compatibility
reasons, it remains disabled by default in the nss packages. This update
makes Firefox enable the mitigation by default. It can be disabled by
setting the NSS\_SSL\_CBC\_RANDOM\_IV environment variable to 0 before
launching Firefox. (BZ#838879)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.6 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill
McCloskey, Abhishek Arya, Arthur Gerkis, Bill Keese, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Bobby
Holley, Code Audit Labs, Mariusz Mlynski, Mario Heiderich, Frederic Buclin,
Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Matt McCutchen, Mario Gomes, and Soroush Dalili as
the original reporters of these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.6 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
\*
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman,
Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox
13.
\*
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher
Mario Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a
mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop
to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes
the address of the previously site entered to be displayed
in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page.
This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
\*
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya
used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-afte.r-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
o CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased o CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode o
CVE-2012-1953: Out of bounds read in
ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor o CVE-2012-1952: Bad
cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
\*
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward
and history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack through the context menu using a data: URL. In
this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show
only this frame", and "View background image") are
disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL,
allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher
Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed
in the HTML feed-view using tag within the RSS . This
problem is due to tags not being filtered out during
parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class
and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.
\*
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher
Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
\*
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony
Payne reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS,
Mozilla's color management library. With a carefully
crafted color profile portions of a user's memory could be
incorporated into a transformed image and possibly
deciphered.
\*
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer
Frederic Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header
is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication
occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it
occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected
against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.
\*
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher
Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher
Matt McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using
the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
\*
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers
Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla
allows the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL,
it is possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution
attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes one version update.
Description:
MozillaFirefox have been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The ollowing security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
\*
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman,
Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox
13.
\*
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher
Mario Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a
mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop
to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes
the address of the previously site entered to be displayed
in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page.
This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
\*
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya
used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-afte.r-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
o CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased o CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode o
CVE-2012-1953: Out of bounds read in
ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor o CVE-2012-1952: Bad
cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
\*
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward
and history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack through the context menu using a data: URL. In
this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show
only this frame", and "View background image") are
disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL,
allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher
Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed
in the HTML feed-view using tag within the RSS . This
problem is due to tags not being filtered out during
parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class
and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.
\*
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher
Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
\*
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony
Payne reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS,
Mozilla's color management library. With a carefully
crafted color profile portions of a user's memory could be
incorporated into a transformed image and possibly
deciphered.
\*
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer
Frederic Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header
is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication
occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it
occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected
against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.
\*
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher
Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher
Matt McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using
the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
\*
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers
Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla
allows the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL,
it is possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution
attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

Screenshot. The basic problem is that the URL gets dragged, but the page immediately cancels the load (via window.stop) and the location still displays the "typed in" google.com URL.
I tend to think that this doesn't need to remain private.

I think that this should be classified as [sg:moderate] because 1) you can't spoof the domain identifier/larry, only the the text box 2) it requires some level of user interactionWhiteboard: [sg:moderate]

This doesn't fail without the patch. ondragend never got called for my synthetic drag.

This prevents the dragend handler from firing, but a site can still just use an interval that calls stop() repeatedly to achieve the same effect, can't it? Being able to detect the drag end isn't really the problem here, IMO.
It would be nice if web pages couldn't interrupt URL bar-triggered loads by calling stop(). That would probably be complicated to fix, though.
An easier fix might be ensuring that the stop() reverts the URL bar.

I tried to modify the test case to do this but couldn't get it to work.
If it worked, we could presumably prevent it with LOAD\_FLAGS\_STOP\_CONTENT (in addition to suppressing dragend).
> An easier fix might be ensuring that the stop() reverts the URL bar.
I couldn't find a decent way to differentiate between user- and script-initiated stops.

[Bug 725611](/show_bug.cgi?id=725611 "VERIFIED FIXED - [CAL-2012-0019]Firefox website spoof vulnerability by hook event") uses a different way of accomplishing the same thing via mousemove handlers and an onbeforeunload handler, so I think the only effective way to deal with this is going to be by changing the behavior on stop(), not dealing with the drag behavior.

<http://gavinsharp.com/tmp/stopalot.html> seems to work for me (essentially the same testcase with a setInterval(stop, 100) instead of dragend).
Why would we need to differentiate between the types of stops?
I can never remember how the userTypedClear/userTypedValue stuff actually works :(

Because people may want to stop page loads without throwing away the URLs they just put there.

There's a nice comment in browser.xml that explains the minutiae, or did you want something more high-level?

Maybe. The comment talks about different scenarios, but it's hard to associate the various cases to the actual code that increments/decrements userTypedClear (including the code in tabbrowser).

I'm not sure that this matters much in practice, but it should be relatively easy to add a STOP\_USER\_TRIGGERED flag to nsIWebNavigation and pass it from BrowserStop, right? Not sure how to best propagate that to the progress listener, though (another state flag, too? that seems kind of wrong...).

I replaced isTabEmpty's empty-body check with an opener check, since the latter seems more accurate and safer and the former only happens to work because about:newtab doesn't have a body.

let stop() revert to the current URI
Can you add a comment that mentions why you're using isTabEmpty? Something like "if the current tab is empty, leave the typed URL (but allow it to change)". Perhaps also worth adding a comment explaining that setting userTypedValue resets userTypedClear.
(Really wish we could rename userTypedClear to "disallowURLBarUpdating" or somesuch, but the compatibility hit probably isn't worth it)

Shouldn't we be checking whether the request status was successful or failure?

The case where the page refreshes automatically while you're trying to type a URL into the URL bar.

The "location bar reflects loaded page after stop()" test was failing, replacing aRequest.status with aStatus fixed it. I don't know what the former is, apparently it's not the same...

Cancelling a load group fires the OnStopRequest before cancelling the request, which explains why the request doesn't have the "right" status yet. I'm not sure what's normally expected, for instance it also seems to be possible to fire an OnStopRequest with different error status results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=840203#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-14 10:31:40 UTC  ``` Security researcher Mario Gomes and research firm Code Audit Labs reported a mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes the address of the previously site entered to be displayed in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page. This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.

                 CVE-2012-1967

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web
browser based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides
rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.

CVE-2012-1948

  Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey
  identified several memory safety problems that may lead to the
  execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1950

  Mario Gomes and Code Audit Labs discovered that it is possible
  to force iceweasel to display the URL of the previous entered site
  through drag and drop actions to the address bar. This can be
  abused to perform phishing attacks.

CVE-2012-1954

  Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem in nsDocument::AdoptNode
  that may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1966

  moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that it is possible to perform cross-site
  scripting attacks through the context menu when using data: URLs.

CVE-2012-1967

  moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that in certain cases, javascript: URLs can
  be executed so that scripts can escape the JavaScript sandbox and run
  with elevated privileges.

Note: We'd like to advise users of Iceweasel's 3.5 branch in Debian
stable to consider to upgrade to the Iceweasel 10.0 ESR (Extended
Support Release) which is now available in Debian Backports.
Although Debian will continue to support Iceweasel 3.5 in stable with
security updates, this can only be done on a best effort base as
upstream provides no such support anymore. On top of that, the 10.0
branch adds proactive security features to the browser.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.16-17.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.6esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

This is basically identical to [bug 724599](/show_bug.cgi?id=724599 "VERIFIED FIXED - [CAL-2012-0001]Spoof after a URL is dragged to location bar, by canceling the load") but with slightly less explicit user interaction... I think we're going to have to revert the urlbar for script-initiated stop()s.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWComponent: Untriaged → Location BarDepends on: [CVE-2012-1950](/show_bug.cgi?id=724599 "VERIFIED FIXED - [CAL-2012-0001]Spoof after a URL is dragged to location bar, by canceling the load")Ever confirmed: trueQA Contact: untriaged → location.barWhiteboard: [sg:moderate]

|  | |

The problem with that is that a page can put a stop() on a timeout to keep the user from editing the url bar text... Can we revert only if we'd started a load from the url bar?

Can we subject stop() to popup abuse controls? As far as I can see, pages only need to use it in response to user interaction.

I'm not seeing any difference in behavior with the PoC in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=725611#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - [CAL-2012-0019]Firefox website spoof vulnerability by hook event") before and after [bug 724599](/show_bug.cgi?id=724599 "VERIFIED FIXED - [CAL-2012-0001]Spoof after a URL is dragged to location bar, by canceling the load") was fixed.

I still don't see any difference with Firefox 12 and the post-checkin build with the fix and the attached POC.

Original advisory details:

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

Matt McCutchen discovered a clickjacking vulnerability in the certificate

warning page. A remote attacker could trick a user into accepting a malicious

certificate via a crafted certificate warning page. ([CVE-2012-1964](/security/CVE-2012-1964))

Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili discovered that javascript was not filtered out

of feed URLs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an

attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks. ([CVE-2012-1965](/security/CVE-2012-1965))

A vulnerability was discovered in the context menu of data: URLs. If the user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2012-1966](/security/CVE-2012-1966))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=840205#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-14 11:37:46 UTC  ``` Google security researcher Abhishek Arya used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused when an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but attempts are made to call into objects in this array later. The second use-after-free problem is in nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document and then adopts into another document, emptying the first one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are dereferenced. The bad cast happens when nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.  All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to 14.0.1 to fix various bugs
and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed: MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla
developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence
of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
presume that with enough effort at least some of these
could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
CVE-2012-1949: Brian Smith, Gary Kwong, Christian Holler,
Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey,
and Kyle Huey reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 13.
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian
Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 13.
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher Mario
Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a mechanism
to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop to the
addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes the
address of the previously site entered to be displayed in
the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page. This
could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya used
the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode CVE-2012-1953:
Out of bounds read in ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor
CVE-2012-1952: Bad cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher Mariusz
Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the location
property. In this issue, calls to history.forward and
history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
through the context menu using a data: URL. In this issue,
context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show only this
frame", and "View background image") are disallowed in a
javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL, allowing for
XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher Mario
Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed in the
HTML feed-view using <embed> tag within the RSS
<description>. This problem is due to <embed> tags not
being filtered out during parsing and can lead to a
potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The flaw
existed in a parser utility class and could affect other
parts of the browser or add-ons which rely on that class to
sanitize untrusted input.
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher Arthur
Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony Payne
reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS, Mozilla’s
color management library. With a carefully crafted color
profile portions of a user's memory could be incorporated
into a transformed image and possibly deciphered.
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer Frédéric
Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header is ignored
when the value is duplicated, for example X-Frame-Options:
SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication occurs for unknown
reasons on some websites and when it occurs results in
Mozilla browsers not being protected against possible
clickjacking attacks on those pages.
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher Bill
Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher Matt
McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using the
certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers Mario
Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla allows
the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL, it is
possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution attack
using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=594439&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/18.0.1025.3 Safari/535.19
Steps to reproduce:
Hi,
When you drag a URL into the address bar of the Mozilla Firefox open the page automatically, but if an attacker to convince the victim to drag an address of a site, and follow with "window.stop ();" the address remains in dragging address bar, thus allowing the attacker to make phishing attacks.
Reproduce:
1. Open PoC.html attached.
2. Drag the text in address bar.
3. See the address bar(in PoC "www.google.com.br").

You mean [bug 700080](/show_bug.cgi?id=700080 "VERIFIED FIXED - URL and SSL/TLS Spoofing with onBlur using window.open(), alert() and window.close()")?

I guess I was thinking more of [bug 714631](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content").

Actually not quite as good a spoof as [bug 714631](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content") on SSL sites, these aren't quite the same.Whiteboard: [sg:high] same cause as 714631? → [sg:moderate] same underlying fix as 714631?

Actually this looks like a dupe of [bug 724599](/show_bug.cgi?id=724599 "VERIFIED FIXED - [CAL-2012-0001]Spoof after a URL is dragged to location bar, by canceling the load") and its dependent bugs.

Well, this was logged two days earlier, leaving the "dupe" issue open to debate. That bug has all of the work on it though.

My use of the word "dupe" has no negative connotation - I was just suggesting that both bugs stem from the same underlying issue. Both reports are valid and useful - which way they get marked (or which one ends up tracking the work) is entirely arbitrary.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

	The underlying browser engine allows address bar spoofing
	through drag-and-drop.

CVE-2012-1954
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the nsDocument::AdoptNode
	function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(heap memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1967
	An error in the implementation of the Javascript sandbox
	allows execution of Javascript code with improper privileges
	using javascript: URLs.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze12.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
