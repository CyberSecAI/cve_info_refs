  "cveId": "CVE-2012-1878",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability arises from a use-after-free condition in Internet Explorer when accessing an object that has been deleted.",
    "vulnerability": "The weakness lies in how Internet Explorer manages objects in memory, specifically during the handling of the `onbeforedeactivate` event. Accessing a freed object can corrupt memory.",
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. With administrative rights, an attacker could take full control of the system, potentially installing programs, altering data, and creating new accounts.",
    "attackVector": "The primary attack vector involves tricking users into visiting a malicious webpage using Internet Explorer, where specially crafted content triggers the vulnerability. This can also be achieved by embedding a malicious ActiveX control in an application or document that uses the IE rendering engine. Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content could also be used.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to host a specially crafted webpage and convince a user to view it using Internet Explorer. This may involve sending a link via email or instant messaging or using compromised websites. No specific user interaction beyond visiting the page is needed, except for the IE developer toolbar to be opened for CVE-2012-1874.  Additionally, the attacker must be capable of crafting the malicious webpage to exploit the use-after-free vulnerability.",
        "additionalDetails": "This vulnerability is one of 13 vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-037. The bulletin identifies the affected software, and provides workarounds and mitigation techniques."
