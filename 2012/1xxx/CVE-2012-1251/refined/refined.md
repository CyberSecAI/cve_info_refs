Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Opera browser's failure to properly verify SSL server certificates. This means the browser does not reliably ensure that a website's certificate is valid and authorized by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of SSL server certificates by the Opera browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Users might unknowingly connect to malicious websites impersonating legitimate ones. This can lead to phishing attacks, where users are tricked into revealing sensitive information to attackers.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** The failure to verify certificates opens the door for man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can intercept and manipulate communication between the user and the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attacks:** An attacker can intercept network traffic and present a fake certificate. This is a network-based vulnerability, exploiting the browser's failure to validate certificates correctly.
- **Websites with Invalid Certificates:** Attackers can set up malicious websites using certificates that are not signed by trusted CAs, which the vulnerable Opera browser may accept without warning.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** Attackers need to be in a position to intercept the victim's network traffic. This can be achieved through various means, such as being on the same network as the victim or performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker must have access to or create a fake SSL certificate that will be presented to the victim's browser during a connection attempt.
- **Social Engineering:** In some instances, an attacker may need to convince a user to ignore browser warnings about invalid certificates (though the vulnerability exists even without user interaction if the browser fails to display such warnings).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in Opera versions prior to 9.63.
- The issue can lead users to unknowingly connect to sites with untrusted or malicious certificates.
- JVN iPedia assigned the weakness as "No Mapping", indicating that the issue could not be classified by the subset of CWE used or was not covered in the used version of CWE. It was given a CWE-Other designation.
- JPCERT/CC analysis indicated a high severity for access required and authentication but a medium severity for user interaction and exploit complexity.

This analysis provides a clearer picture of the technical details and implications of CVE-2012-1251, based on the information provided.
