| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=808439#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-30 11:39:00 UTC  ``` An cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way phpPgAdmin, a web-based PostgreSQL database administration tool, performed presentation of the default list of functions, being present in the database, to the user upon request. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page, which once visited by an unsuspecting, valid phpPgAdmin user could lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of logged in phpPgAdmin user.  References: [1] <http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-announce/2012-03/msg00016.php> [2] <https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin/commit/e92a003624609a445c4cf57c9c3d1fcef0eae47c#diff-0>  Upstream patch: [3] <https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin/commit/74174ad639664b52cc1609ede0af8bc403e98a00>  CVE request: [4] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/28/11>  CVE assignment: [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/29/6>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=808439#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-30 11:43:49 UTC  ``` This issue previously affected the versions of the phpPgAdmin package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15, 16, and as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6 versions.  Though the following phpPgAdmin have been scheduled already: 1) phpPgAdmin-5.0.4-1.fc15 for Fedora 15, 2) phpPgAdmin-5.0.4-1.fc16 for Fedora 16, 3) phpPgAdmin-5.0.4-1.el5  for Fedora EPEL 5, 4) phpPgAdmin-5.0.4-1.el6  for Fedora EPEL 6  to correct this deficiency. Once the above packages have passed the required level of testing, they will be pushed to the -stable repository for each of the particular releases above.   ``` |  |

"""
Fix XSS in function.php, reported by Mateusz Goik.

I'm not sure why the name and the type the functions were not escaped
*on purpose* here. There's no more reason here than in any other place
with other PostgreSQL objects to not escape the name or the type...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
