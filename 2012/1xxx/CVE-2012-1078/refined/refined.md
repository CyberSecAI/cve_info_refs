**Attack Vectors and Required Capabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or data exfiltration from the database. Attackers may not need specific privileges.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.  This can allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface web pages. Some XSS attacks may require authenticated users or some user interaction.
*   **Open Redirection:**  Attackers can redirect users to a different website by manipulating a redirect URL parameter.  This could be used to phish for user credentials. Some open redirections may require user interaction.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information stored on the server.
*    **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious authenticated user may be able to execute code on the server.
*  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can perform unwanted actions in an application in which a user is authenticated.

**Mitigation:**

The bulletin provides solutions for most of the listed extensions, including updates to fixed versions. For some, the advice is to remove them from the system.
