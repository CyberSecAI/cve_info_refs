Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Mit dem ManageEngine Applications Manager können IT-Administratoren von Unternehmen und Datenzentrumsgruppen die
Leistung ihrer heterogenen Applikationen von einer einzigen Web-Konsole aus überwachen, bei Problemen Alarme
empfangen, Fehler suchen bzw. diagnostizieren, Tendenzen analysieren und Kapazitäten mit Hilfe umfassender
Reports planen. Um den verschiedenen Ansprüchen aller Administratoren gerecht zu werden, unterstützt der Applications
Manager wichtige Produkte. Diese sind in drei Kategorien aufgeteilt: Die Funktionalität „Application Server Monitoring“
bietet detailierte Informationen zu häufig verwendeter Software, wie z.B. Java/J2EE, Microsoft .NET, Oracle Application
Server und Tomcat. Von diesen Diensten hängen wiederum viele Anwendungen ab, so dass die Sicherung der Stabilität dieser
Application Server essentiell ist. Auf der Seite der Datenbanken werden Protokolle und administrative Informationen zu gängige
Produkten, wie Oracle Datenbanken, MySQL und DB2 abgefragt und können direkt nach Abfrage Benachrichtigungen auslösen. Dies
hilft einzuschreiten, bevor kritische Zustände erreicht werden. Schlussendlich vervollständigt „System Management“ die drei
Kategorien, da neben den Applikationen und Datenbanken auch die Schicht darunter, die Betriebssysteme vom Applications
Manager überwacht werden. Dabei spielt es keine Rolle, ob Sie zum Beispiel Microsoft Windows, diverse Linux Distributionen
oder Mac OS verwenden.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
