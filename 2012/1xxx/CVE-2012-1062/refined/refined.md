Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: Multiple non-persistent input validation vulnerabilities (client-side)**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation on the client-side, allowing injection of malicious code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in multiple modules.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can hijack customer/admin sessions.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation is remote by injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker is needed.
*   **Vulnerable Modules:**
    *   ThresholdActionConfiguration.jsp
    *   PopUp_Graph.jsp
    *   showresource.do

**Vulnerability 2: Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection vulnerability, allowing the execution of arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information, modify data or potentially take control of the database server
*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation is remote by injecting SQL code into the `?periods` parameter of the alert module.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker is needed.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:**
    *   `?periods`

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The document describes two main classes of vulnerabilities in ManageEngine Applications Manager:

1.  **Client-Side XSS:** Multiple non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities through several vulnerable parameters, which can allow an attacker to hijack user sessions.
2.  **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the alert module using the `?periods` parameter that could result in data breaches or full database compromise.

The document also provides proof-of-concept URLs for both types of vulnerabilities, demonstrating how they can be exploited and also includes SQL error messages.

The document indicates that client-side vulnerabilities have a low security risk, while SQL injection is considered a high security risk.
