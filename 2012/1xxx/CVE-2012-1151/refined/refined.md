Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from format string flaws within the `libdbd-pg-perl` library. Specifically, the `pg_warn` and `dbd_st_prepare` functions in the `dbdimp.c` file were vulnerable to format string injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `pg_warn` and `dbd_st_prepare` functions directly used untrusted input from the database server as format strings in logging or error handling. This could lead to a format string vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious PostgreSQL server could send crafted database warnings or specially-crafted DBD statements containing format string specifiers, leading to a crash of the `libdbd-pg-perl` based application.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In a more severe scenario, this vulnerability could potentially be exploited by a malicious database server to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable application, under the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack vector is remote, as a malicious PostgreSQL server can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted database warnings or specially-crafted DBD statements to a vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromised or Malicious PostgreSQL Server:** The attacker needs to control a PostgreSQL server that is communicating with a client application that uses a vulnerable version of `libdbd-pg-perl`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was triggered when a database server sent a specially crafted warning or a prepared statement to the client.
- The issue was fixed by explicitly using controlled format strings.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of `libdbd-pg-perl` and various operating systems/distributions.
- Red Hat rated this as having a "Moderate" impact, while Debian rated it "grave".
- Patches were released for various distributions to correct the vulnerability.
