  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-1154",
    "description": "mod_cluster 1.0.10 CP02 and 1.1.3 registers and exposes the root context of a server by default, despite ROOT being in the excludedContexts list. This is due to a regression that bypassed context filtering for the root context, causing the root context to be enabled inadvertently. This flaw is fixed in mod_cluster 1.0.10 CP03 and 1.1.4.",
    "affected_products": [
      "JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2",
      "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2",
      "JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2",
      "JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.3"
    ],
    "root_cause": "A regression in mod_cluster versions 1.0.10 CP02 and 1.1.3 caused context filtering to be bypassed for the root context, inadvertently enabling it even when it was included in the excludedContexts list.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect context filtering",
       "Regression introduced in a security update"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to an application deployed on the root context.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Network access to the server",
        "Ability to send requests to the vulnerable service"
    ],
     "additional_information": "The issue was introduced after a security update RHSA-2012:0035. The issue was addressed in mod_cluster versions 1.0.10 CP03 and 1.1.4."
