Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of sanitization of the `view` parameter within the HTTP request used to display the Day view of the Standard HTML Calendar in Zimbra. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By injecting JavaScript code into the `view` parameter of the calendar URL, an attacker can cause the injected script to execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This allows for a variety of malicious actions including, but not limited to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the webpage
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious site
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code in the `view` parameter, such as:
    ```
    /zimbra/h/calendar?view=<script>alert('XSS')</script>&date=20110822T195312
    ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a victim.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click or access the crafted URL.
- **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are required to execute the attack. It's a client-side attack executed within the browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects the Standard HTML Client of Zimbra.
- The provided blog post and bug report demonstrate the XSS using `alert()` function, but in practice, attackers can inject much more sophisticated payloads.
- The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the `view` parameter in the calendar JSP.
- The bug report mentions the following vulnerable versions: 6.0.15, 7.1.3, and 7.1.1_ZCS_Helix.
- The `st2tea.blogspot.com` content provides a PoC using a modified URL that includes various XSS payloads for testing purposes.
