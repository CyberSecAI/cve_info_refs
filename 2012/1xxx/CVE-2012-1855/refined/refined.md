  "CVE-2012-1855": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework due to the improper execution of a function pointer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the .NET Framework improperly executing a function pointer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper execution of function pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web browsing scenario: Attacker hosts a specially crafted website with a malicious XAML Browser Application (XBAP), convincing a user to visit it via a link or advertisement.",
        "Windows .NET application scenario: Malicious .NET applications bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to host a website or have their malicious .NET application executed. In the web browsing scenario, they need to convince a user to visit a malicious site via social engineering. In the application scenario they need to get the user to execute the malicious application.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2, 3.5.1, and 4.0 on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. Users with fewer rights may be less impacted. The fix addresses the manner in which .NET Framework validates data passed to function pointers. Mitigation includes disabling XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer. Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server can mitigate web browsing attacks from untrusted sites. Standard .NET Framework applications are not affected, only specially crafted applications that exploit the function pointer vulnerability."
