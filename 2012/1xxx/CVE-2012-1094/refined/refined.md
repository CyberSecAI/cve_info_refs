The provided content relates to CVE-2012-1094.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a mismatch between how JBoss AS 7 and mod\_cluster handle excluded contexts. The `excluded-contexts` list in mod\_cluster configuration requires both the hostname and path to correctly identify a context to exclude. Due to a discrepancy concerning the default hostname between AS 7 and mod\_cluster, the entries in the `excluded-contexts` list are not correctly matched by mod\_cluster. Consequently, the root context is exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- mod\_cluster improperly handles the `excluded-contexts` list when the hostname is not explicitly specified leading to unintended exposure of the root context.
- The default behavior of mod\_cluster to register and expose the root context of a JBoss AS 7 server, even when it is intended to be excluded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposing the root context of JBoss AS 7 server to external access which can lead to information disclosure or unauthorized control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an external attacker accessing the JBoss AS 7 server through mod\_cluster where the root context is improperly exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the JBoss AS 7 server through mod\_cluster.
- The attacker does not require any special capabilities other than network access to exploit the exposed root context of JBoss AS 7 server.

**Additional Details:**
- This issue was resolved in JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final by automatically prepending the default hostname to the path when parsing the `excluded-contexts` list in mod_cluster configuration.
- The vulnerability does not affect OpenShift because mod\_cluster is not used.
- No SOA-P/BRMS-P/EDS-P products are based on AS 7 at the time of the report.
- This vulnerability only affects community JBoss AS 7 prior to 7.1.1 and does not affect components shipped with any Red Hat products.
