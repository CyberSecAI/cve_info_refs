I am not fully convinced it needs a CVE.

It basically boils down to the old "logfile with content that might be controlled
by an attacker pasted raw to a terminal" issue.

There is some more control on the person who builds a specific package what is output
thant there usually is in logfiles though.

A rogue server is unlikely, however a malicious packager could echo "bad escape code"
in his build and then ask for help on our IRC channels or mailinglists with package Y on project X.
(anyone can create an account and build packages ... and asking for help is not uncommon)
e.g. with "look at logfile with: 'osc buildlog home:user foopackage standard i586'.)

Ciao, Marcus

Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- osc: Improper sanitization of terminal emulator
 escape sequences when displaying build log and build status

Hello Kurt, Steve, Marcus, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way osc, the Python language based command
line client for the openSUSE build service, displayed build logs and build
status for particular build. A rogue repository server could use this flaw to
modify window's title, or possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite
files via a specially-crafted build log or build status output containing an
escape sequence for a terminal emulator.

References:
[1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=749335>
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=798353>

I need to conclude, I don't know how OBS repositories work (if there is a chance
of a rogue server being present). In any case, this issue is on the border
(pretty unlikely someone could alter content of OBS package during build --
in that case there would be more urgent issues than just particular terminal
window title change).

But strictly taken, the trust boundary is crossed in the moment, someone
would schedule OBS build and wouldn't expect the build log / status can
perform terminal "side" effect yet.

Marcus, please correct me if you don't agree this should get a CVE identifier.

If no one having objections and request appropriate, could you allocate one?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

openSUSE Security Update: osc: Update to 0.134.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2012:0400-1
Rating: low
References: #624980 #679980 #711770 #749335
Cross-References: CVE-2012-1095
Affected Products:
openSUSE 12.1
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has three fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update of osc to 0.134.1 provides the following
changes:
\* adding unlock command
\* maintenance\_incident requests get created with source
revision of package
\* Enables new maintenance submissions for new OBS 2.3
maintenance model
\* Fixes srcmd5 revisions in submit request, when link
target != submission target
\* patchinfo call can work without checked out copy now
\* use qemu as fallback for building not directly supported
architectures
\* "results --watch" option to watch build results until
they finished building
\* fixes injection of terminal control chars
(bnc#749335)(CVE-2012-1095)
\* support dryrun of branching to preview the expected
result. "osc sm" is doing this now by default.
\* maintenance requests accept package lists as source and
target incidents to be merged in
\* add "setincident" command to "request" to re-direct a
maintenance request
\* ask user to create "maintenance incident" request when
submit request is failing at release project
\* "osc my patchinfos" is showing patchinfos where any open
bug is assigned to user
\* "osc my" or "osc my work" is including assigned patchinfos
\* "osc branch --maintenance" is creating setups for
maintenance
\* removed debug code lead to warning message (fix by
Marcus\_H)
\* add --meta option also to "list", "cat" and "less"
commands
\* project checkout is skipping packages linking to project
local packages by default
\* add --keep-link option to copypac command
\* source validators are not called by default anymore:
\* support source services using OBS project or package name
\* support updateing \_patchinfo file with new issues just by
calling "osc patchinfo" again
\* branch --add-repositories can be used to add repos from
source project to target project
\* branch --extend-package-names can be used to do mbranch
like branch of a single package
\* branch --new-package can be used to do branch from a not
yet existing package (to define later submit target)
\* show declined requests which created by user
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 12.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2012-170
- openSUSE 11.4:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2012-170
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
