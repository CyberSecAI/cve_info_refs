  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of terminal emulator escape sequences when displaying build logs and build status.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The osc command line client does not properly sanitize terminal emulator escape sequences in build logs and build status output.",
      "A malicious packager can inject escape codes into build logs.",
       "The client displays potentially attacker-controlled data without proper sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify the terminal window's title, execute arbitrary commands, or overwrite files via a specially crafted build log or build status output containing escape sequences.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A rogue repository server could inject malicious escape sequences into build logs.",
      "A malicious packager could inject escape sequences into their package's build process, and then ask others to inspect the log output, thus triggering the exploit."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to control the content of the build log or status output.",
      "For a rogue repository server, the attacker needs to be able to alter the content of the server.",
      "For a malicious packager, the attacker needs to be able to create a package and have it built by osc."
