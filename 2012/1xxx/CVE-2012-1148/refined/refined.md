  "CVE-2012-1148": {
    "description": "The Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory resources.",

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A memory leak vulnerability exists in Expat's poolGrow function. When memory reallocation fails during processing of XML files, Expat fails to free the previously allocated memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory Leak",
        "Denial of Service"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a specially-crafted XML file, leading to excessive memory consumption and potentially application crash.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote, through the processing of a specially-crafted XML file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted XML file to the application linked against Expat.",
      "more_details": "This issue arises from a failure to handle memory reallocation correctly during XML processing, specifically if realloc_fcn returns NULL, the code overwrites the pool->blocks pointer, leading to memory leak. This can be triggered by providing a complex XML structure with deeply nested entities."
