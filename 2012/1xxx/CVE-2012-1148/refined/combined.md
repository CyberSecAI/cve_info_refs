[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.4)

## Details

USN-1613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python 2.5. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Python 2.4.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [python2.4-minimal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)
* [python2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# USN-1613-1: Python 2.5 vulnerabilities

17 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.5.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.5](/security/cves?package=python2.5) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.5)

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [python2.5-minimal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.5)
  -
  [2.5.2-2ubuntu6.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.5/2.5.2-2ubuntu6.2)
* [python2.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.5)
  -
  [2.5.2-2ubuntu6.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.5/2.5.2-2ubuntu6.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## Synopsis

Moderate: expat security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0731)

## Topic

Updated expat packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Expat is a C library written by James Clark for parsing XML documents.

A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of hash arrays in
Expat. An attacker could use this flaw to make an application using Expat
consume an excessive amount of CPU time by providing a specially-crafted
XML file that triggers multiple hash function collisions. To mitigate
this issue, randomization has been added to the hash function to reduce the
chance of an attacker successfully causing intentional collisions.
(CVE-2012-0876)

A memory leak flaw was found in Expat. If an XML file processed by an
application linked against Expat triggered a memory re-allocation failure,
Expat failed to free the previously allocated memory. This could cause the
application to exit unexpectedly or crash when all available memory is
exhausted. (CVE-2012-1148)

All Expat users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, applications using the Expat library must be restarted for the
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1527-1: Expat vulnerabilities

10 August 2012

Expat could be made to cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU
and memory resources.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [expat](/security/cves?package=expat) - XML parsing C library - example application

## Details

It was discovered that Expat computed hash values without restricting the

ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If a user or application linked

against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could

cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that Expat did not properly handle memory reallocation

when processing XML files. If a user or application linked against Expat were

tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of

service by consuming excessive memory resources. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS, 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c0)  Grant Murphy    2014-07-21 06:46:47 UTC  ``` The following flaw has been fixed in the Apache HTTP Server:  "A flaw was found in the WinNT MPM in httpd versions 2.4.1 to 2.4.9, when using the default AcceptFilter for that platform. A remote attacker could send carefully crafted requests that would leak memory and eventually lead to a denial of service against the server."  External References:  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c1)  Grant Murphy    2014-07-22 07:54:50 UTC  ``` Upstream fix:   <https://github.com/apache/httpd/commit/c17f0b89657cf03318fe2b624adc92cae477f81b>  Code not present in 2.2   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c2)  Grant Murphy    2014-07-22 08:44:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not affected. This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7, Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 and 2, and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 and 6. This flaw only affects httpd running on Microsoft Windows. Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 and 2, and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 and 6 can be run on Microsoft Windows. However, these products provide httpd 2.2, which is not affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-07-23 06:47:29 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1610652>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c4)  JBoss JIRA Server    2016-09-06 13:20:40 UTC  ``` Michal Karm Babacek <mbabacek> updated the status of jira [JWS-433](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JWS-433) to Resolved   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-15 22:13:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2016:2957 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=801648#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-03-09 04:54:47 UTC  ```  Tim Boddy reported a memory leak in poolGrow [1]  This bug applies at least to 1.95.8, 2.0.0 and 2.0.1  poolGrow in xml.parse.cpp has the following block of code:     if (pool->blocks && pool->start == pool->blocks->s) {     int blockSize = (int)(pool->end - pool->start)*2;     pool->blocks = (BLOCK *)       pool->mem->realloc_fcn(pool->blocks,                              (offsetof(BLOCK, s)                               + blockSize * sizeof(XML_Char)));     if (pool->blocks == NULL)       return XML_FALSE;     pool->blocks->size = blockSize;     pool->ptr = pool->blocks->s + (pool->ptr - pool->start);     pool->start = pool->blocks->s;     pool->end = pool->start + blockSize;   } It looks like this will cause a memory leak if realloc_fcn returns NULL because pool->blocks will be overwritten but the old memory area to which it pointed won't be freed.   The other places where reallocation is done in this file (via the REALLOC macro) don't have this bug because they correctly store the result in a temporary variable.   This bug allows a serious DOS attack on a server that accepts XML-based requests if a request is seen of the following form:  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY a "1234567890" > <!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;" > <!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;" > <!ENTITY d "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;" > <!ENTITY e "&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;" > <!ENTITY f "&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;" > <!ENTITY g "&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;" > <!ENTITY h "&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;" > <!ENTITY i "&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;" > <!ENTITY j "&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;" > <!ENTITY k "&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;" > <!ENTITY l "&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;" > <!ENTITY m "&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;" > <!ENTITY n "&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;" > ]> <foo bar="&n;"/>  When the attribute is expanded, the realloc (assuming that it bounds the size of the request) will fail, leaking the buffer from before the realloc.

RHSA-2016:0062 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2016:0062 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 that fixes four security
issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

[Updated 15th February 2018]
Previously, this erratum stated that CVE-2012-1148 was fixed .This was incorrect;the erratum text has now been modified to reflect this.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
(mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
Native library.

Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of hash arrays in
Expat. An attacker could use this flaw to make an application using Expat
consume an excessive amount of CPU time by providing a specially-crafted
XML file that triggers multiple hash function collisions. To mitigate this
issue, randomization has been added to the hash function to reduce the
chance of an attacker successfully causing intentional collisions.
(CVE-2012-0876)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when
processing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could use
Trailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header processing was
performed by other modules. This could, for example, lead to a bypass of
header restrictions defined with mod\_headers. (CVE-2013-5704)

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web
Server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=801648#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-03-09 04:54:47 UTC  ```  Tim Boddy reported a memory leak in poolGrow [1]  This bug applies at least to 1.95.8, 2.0.0 and 2.0.1  poolGrow in xml.parse.cpp has the following block of code:     if (pool->blocks && pool->start == pool->blocks->s) {     int blockSize = (int)(pool->end - pool->start)*2;     pool->blocks = (BLOCK *)       pool->mem->realloc_fcn(pool->blocks,                              (offsetof(BLOCK, s)                               + blockSize * sizeof(XML_Char)));     if (pool->blocks == NULL)       return XML_FALSE;     pool->blocks->size = blockSize;     pool->ptr = pool->blocks->s + (pool->ptr - pool->start);     pool->start = pool->blocks->s;     pool->end = pool->start + blockSize;   } It looks like this will cause a memory leak if realloc_fcn returns NULL because pool->blocks will be overwritten but the old memory area to which it pointed won't be freed.   The other places where reallocation is done in this file (via the REALLOC macro) don't have this bug because they correctly store the result in a temporary variable.   This bug allows a serious DOS attack on a server that accepts XML-based requests if a request is seen of the following form:  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY a "1234567890" > <!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;" > <!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;" > <!ENTITY d "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;" > <!ENTITY e "&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;" > <!ENTITY f "&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;" > <!ENTITY g "&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;" > <!ENTITY h "&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;" > <!ENTITY i "&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;" > <!ENTITY j "&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;" > <!ENTITY k "&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;" > <!ENTITY l "&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;" > <!ENTITY m "&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;" > <!ENTITY n "&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;" > ]> <foo bar="&n;"/>  When the attribute is expanded, the realloc (assuming that it bounds the size of the request) will fail, leaking the buffer from before the realloc.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
