Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-1109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in a regular expression within the `mwlib` library used for parsing the `#iferror` magic function. The original regular expression `r'<(div|span|p|strong)\s([^<>]*\s)*?class="error"[^<>]*>'` was overly complex and allowed for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack via a specially crafted input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regex Complexity:** The regular expression used to identify error conditions was too complex, specifically due to the `([^<>]*\s)*?` which could cause catastrophic backtracking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted input to the `mwlib` library, which would force the vulnerable regex to perform a large number of matching operations, consuming excessive CPU resources and potentially making the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via crafted input to the mwlib library.
- **Specially Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to provide input containing a specially crafted #iferror magic function that triggers the catastrophic backtracking within the regular expression.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send a crafted request to an application using the vulnerable `mwlib` library. No special access or privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by simplifying the regular expression to `r'<(div|span|p|strong)\s[^<>]*class="error"[^<>]*>'`. This fix eliminated the possibility of catastrophic backtracking while still correctly identifying the error conditions.
- The fix was implemented in upstream version 0.13.5 of `mwlib`.
- Red Hat bugzilla entries ([800064](show_bug.cgi?id=800064), [800066](show_bug.cgi?id=800066), and [800067](show_bug.cgi?id=800067)) were created to track and address this issue in Fedora and EPEL distributions.
