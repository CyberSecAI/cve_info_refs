Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper validation of HTTP GET requests. The Netmechanica NetDecision Traffic Grapher Server does not correctly handle malformed HTTP requests, specifically when an invalid HTTP version is provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the source code of the `default.nd` file due to the improper handling of the crafted HTTP request with an invalid version and multiple CRLF sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to view the source code of the server-side scripts (specifically `default.nd`), which could contain sensitive information like passwords, database connection strings, or other critical configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the target server.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs knowledge of crafting HTTP GET requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a GET request for `/default.nd` or `/test.nd` with an invalid HTTP version number (e.g., `HTTP/-1111111`) followed by multiple `\r\n` (CRLF) sequences.
- This malformed request causes the server to leak the source code of the targeted `.nd` file.
- The exploit provided in the content demonstrates sending the crafted request and then receiving the source code as a response.

**Affected Software:**
- Netmechanica NetDecision Traffic Grapher Server version 4.5.1

**Mitigation:**
- The vendor released a fix in version 4.6.1. Users should upgrade to this version to remediate the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit code is available and provided in the `exploit-db` content.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Prabhu S Angadi of SecPod Technologies.
- The CVSS score indicates a "High" risk due to the potential for complete confidentiality impact.
