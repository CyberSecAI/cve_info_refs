# USN-1372-1: Puppet vulnerabilities

23 February 2012

Puppet could be made to overwrite files and run programs with administrator
privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [puppet](/security/cves?package=puppet) - Centralized configuration management

## Details

It was discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when executing

commands as different users. If an attacker had control of the execution

manifests or the executed command, this could be used to execute code with

elevated group permissions (typically root). ([CVE-2012-1053](/security/CVE-2012-1053))

It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type

is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite

arbitrary files and escalate privileges. ([CVE-2012-1054](/security/CVE-2012-1054))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet)
  -
  [2.7.1-1ubuntu3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/2.7.1-1ubuntu3.5)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet)
  -
  [2.6.4-2ubuntu2.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/2.6.4-2ubuntu2.8)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet)
  -
  [2.6.1-0ubuntu2.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/2.6.1-0ubuntu2.6)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet)
  -
  [0.25.4-2ubuntu6.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/0.25.4-2ubuntu6.6)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : puppet
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1053 CVE-2012-1054

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management tool.

CVE-2012-1053
	Puppet runs execs with an unintended group privileges,
	potentially leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2012-1054
	The k5login type writes to untrusted locations,
	enabling local users to escalate their privileges
	if the k5login type is used.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6.2-5+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.7.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
