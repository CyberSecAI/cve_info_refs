| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=796438#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-22 21:35:04 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that, within the kadmin protocol, the access controls for get_strings/set_string were insufficient; anyone with global list privileges could get or modify string attributed on any principal.  It was also noted that the exposure depends on how generous the kadmind acl was with list permissions and whether or not string attributes were used in deployment (and noting that nothing in the core code uses them yet).  This has been fixed upstream [2] and in Fedora [3].   [1] <http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=7093> [2] <http://src.mit.edu/fisheye/changelog/krb5/?cs=25704> [3] <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=300840>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=796438#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-22 22:10:23 UTC  ``` This flaw was introduced in krb5 1.10, so only affected Fedora 17 (in current development).  It has been fixed there; earlier versions of Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux are not affected.   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of krb5 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.   ``` |  |

# Kerberos 5 Release 1.10.7

* [Announcement](#announcement)* [README file](README-1.10.7.txt)* [Known Bugs](http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/NoAuth/krb5-1.10/bugs-1.10.7.html)* [Documentation](#documentation)* [Retrieving](#fetching)

## Kerberos 5 Release 1.10.7 is now available

The MIT Kerberos Team announces the availability of the
krb5-1.10.7 release. The [detached PGP
signature](krb5-1.10.7.sig) is available without going through the download
page, if you wish to verify the authenticity of a distribution
you have obtained elsewhere.

Please see the [README file](README-1.10.7.txt) for a
more complete list of changes.

You may also see the current full
[list
of fixed bugs](http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/NoAuth/krb5-1.10/fixed-1.10.7.html) tracked in our RT bugtracking system.
## DES transition

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as
weak. The krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites
to migrate away from using single-DES cryptosystems. Among
these is a configuration variable that enables "weak" enctypes,
which now defaults to "false" beginning with krb5-1.8.
## Major changes in krb5-1.10.7 (2013-11-06)

This is a bugfix release. The krb5-1.10 release series is in
maintenance, and for new deployments, installers should prefer the
krb5-1.11 release series or later.

* Fix a KDC locking issue that could lead to the KDC process
  holding a persistent lock, preventing administrative actions
  such as password changes.* Fix a number of bugs related to KDC master key rollover.* Fix a KDC null pointer dereference [CVE-2013-1418] that
      could affect KDCs that serve multiple realms.

## Major changes in krb5-1.10.6 (2013-06-05)

This is a bugfix release. The krb5-1.10 release series is in
maintenance, and for new deployments, installers should prefer
the krb5-1.11 release series or later.

* Fix a UDP ping-pong vulnerability in the kpasswd (password
  changing) service. [CVE-2002-2443]* Improve interoperability with some Windows native PKINIT
    clients.

## Major changes in krb5-1.10.5 (2013-04-17)

This is a bugfix release. The krb5-1.10 release series is in
maintenance, and for new deployments, installers should prefer the
krb5-1.11 release series or later.

* Fix KDC null pointer dereference in TGS-REQ handling
  [CVE-2013-1416]* Incremental propagation could erroneously act as if a
    slave's database were current after the slave received a full
    dump that failed to load.

## Major changes in 1.10.4 (2013-03-01)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix null PKINIT pointer dereference vulnerabilities
  [CVE-2012-1016, CVE-2013-1415]* Prevent the KDC from returning a host-based service
    principal referral to the local realm.

## Major changes in 1.10.3 (2012-08-08)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix KDC uninitialized pointer vulnerabilities that could
  lead to a denial of service [CVE-2012-1014] or remote code
  execution [CVE-2012-1015].* Correctly use default\_tgs\_enctypes instead of
    default\_tkt\_enctypes for TGS requests.

## Major changes in 1.10.2 (2012-05-31)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix an interop issue with Windows Server 2008 R2 Read-Only Domain
  Controllers.* Update a workaround for a glibc bug that would cause DNS PTR
    queries to occur even when rdns = false.* Fix a kadmind denial of service issue (null pointer
      dereference), which could only be triggered by an
      administrator with the "create" privilege. [CVE-2012-1013]

## Major changes in 1.10.1 (2012-03-08)

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix access controls for KDB string attributes
  [CVE-2012-1012]* Make the ASN.1 encoding of key version numbers interoperate
    with Windows Read-Only Domain Controllers* Avoid generating spurious password expiry warnings in cases
      where the KDC sends an account expiry time without a password
      expiry time.

## Major changes in 1.10 (2012-01-27)

Code quality:

* Fix MITKRB5-SA-2011-006 and MITKRB5-SA-2011-007 KDC
  denial of service vulnerabilities [CVE-2011-1527
  CVE-2011-1528 CVE-2011-1529 CVE-2011-1530].* Update the Fortuna implementation to more accurately
    implement the description in *Cryptography Engineering*,
    and make it the default PRNG.* Add an alternative PRNG that relies on the OS native
      PRNG.

Developer experience:

* Add the ability for GSSAPI servers to use any keytab key
  for a specified service, if the server specifies a
  host-based name with no hostname component.* In the build system, identify the source files needed for
    per-message processing within a kernel and ensure that they remain
    independent.* Allow rd\_safe and rd\_priv to ignore the remote address.* Rework KDC and kadmind networking code to use an event loop
        architecture.* Add a plugin interface for providing configuration information.

Administrator experience:

* Add more complete support for renaming principals.* Add the profile variable ignore\_acceptor\_hostname in libdefaults. If
    set, GSSAPI will ignore the hostname component of acceptor names
    supplied by the server, allowing any keytab key matching the service
    to be used.* Add support for string attributes on principal entries.* Allow password changes to work over NATs.

End-user experience:

* Add the DIR credential cache type, which can hold a collection of
  credential caches.* Enhance kinit, klist, and kdestroy to support credential cache
    collections if the cache type supports it.* Add the kswitch command, which changes the selected default cache
      within a collection.* Add heuristic support for choosing client credentials based on the
        service realm.* Add support for $HOME/.k5identity, which allows credential choice
          based on configured rules.* Add support for localization. (No translations are provided in this
            release, but the infrastructure is present for redistributors to
            supply them.)

Protocol evolution:

* Make PKINIT work with FAST in the client library.
