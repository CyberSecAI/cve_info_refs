Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient access controls for `get_strings` and `set_string` operations within the Kerberos `kadmin` protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Privilege Checks:** The `kadmin` protocol did not properly restrict access to string attributes.
*   **Global List Privilege Misuse:** Anyone with global list privileges within `kadmin` could potentially access and modify string attributes of any Kerberos principal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with list privileges could read sensitive string attributes associated with Kerberos principals.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify string attributes, potentially disrupting Kerberos operations or leading to other security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Exploitation would likely occur over the network via the Kerberos `kadmin` protocol.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker would need valid credentials with global list privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Global List Privilege:** Attackers must possess the Kerberos global list privilege within `kadmin`.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers need network access to the Kerberos administration server (kadmind).
*   **Understanding of kadmin:** The attacker must have familiarity with `kadmin` protocol.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in Kerberos version 1.10.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in krb5 1.10.1.
*   The impact of this issue depends on how string attributes are used in the deployment.
*   The bug report mentions that this did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6, but did affect Fedora 17.
