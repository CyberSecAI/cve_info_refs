Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the second document:

**Vulnerability 1: Brute Force**

*   **Root Cause:** The `wgarcmin.cgi` script lacks protection against brute-force attacks.
*   **Weakness:** Absence of rate limiting, account lockout, or other countermeasures against repeated login attempts.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Webglimpse administrative interface by repeatedly attempting different username/password combinations until successful.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends numerous requests to the `wgarcmin.cgi` script with different login credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `wgarcmin.cgi` script, and knowledge of the location of the script (as well as the program being vulnerable). They may start with a default user and try to get the guest account to then escalate.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization/encoding of user-supplied input in the `wgarcmin.cgi` script.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   The `URL` parameter within the `URL2FIL` parameter, the `FILE` parameter in `FIL2URL`, and the `DOMAIN` parameter, are not properly sanitized.
    *   Allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit a URL with the crafted parameters.
    *   This could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters, and lures a victim to click it or visit a page embedding the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to create malicious URLs with javascript injection to send to a victim, or embed on a page.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Webglimpse versions 2.18.8 and earlier are confirmed to be vulnerable.
*   The analysis suggests that version 2.20.0 is also likely vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The attacker can leverage the Brute Force vulnerability to gain access to a guest account, and then exploit directory traversal and authorization bypass vulnerabilities (mentioned in the content but not detailed) to further escalate to an admin account.
*   The content references previous vulnerabilities, but they are not detailed here, only linked.
*   The content provides specific vulnerable URLs and examples of XSS payloads.

This information clearly relates to vulnerabilities described in the document, and provides useful information.
