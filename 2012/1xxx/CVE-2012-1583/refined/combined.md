| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=752304#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-11-09 06:05:16 UTC  ``` The bug is caused by sk_buff double free and cannot be triggered without xfrm6_tunnel module loaded. If you do not need to use the xfrm6_tunnel module, you can choose to blacklist it.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=752304#c7)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-03-30 04:24:43 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <http://git.kernel.org/linus/d0772b70> (v2.6.22-rc1)   Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0480.html>. A future kernel update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=752304#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-13 04:27:20 UTC  ``` If you do not run applications that use xfrm6_tunnel, you can prevent the xfrm6_tunnel module from being loaded by creating (as the root user) a "/etc/modprobe.d/xfrm6_tunnel.conf" file, and adding the following line to it:  blacklist xfrm6_tunnel  This way, the xfrm6_tunnel module cannot be loaded accidentally. A reboot is not necessary for this change to take effect.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=752304#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-17 17:54:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0480 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0480.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=752304#c17)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-05-04 08:52:58 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 818873](show_bug.cgi?id=818873 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2012-1583 kernel: ipv6: panic using raw sockets [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=752304#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-12 14:55:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2012:0720 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0720.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2012:0488 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-04-17
Updated:
2012-04-17
# RHSA-2012:0488 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor5 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor5 package that fixes three security issues and
one bug is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor5 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way libtasn1 decoded DER data. An attacker could
create a carefully-crafted X.509 certificate that, when parsed by an
application that uses GnuTLS, could cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2012-1569)

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS decrypted malformed TLS records. This
could cause a TLS/SSL client or server to crash when processing a
specially-crafted TLS record from a remote TLS/SSL connection peer.
(CVE-2012-1573)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the implementation of the printf
functions family. This could allow an attacker to bypass FORTIFY\_SOURCE
protections and execute arbitrary code using a format string flaw in an
application, even though these protections are expected to limit the
impact of such flaws to an application abort. (CVE-2012-0864)

Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Hall of Mu Dynamics for reporting
CVE-2012-1569 and CVE-2012-1573.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

CVE-2011-4128 (gnutls issue)

CVE-2012-1583 (kernel issue)

CVE-2011-3045 (libpng issue)

CVE-2012-0884 and CVE-2012-1165 (openssl issues)

Further information on the changes made to the package is available on the
relevant errata:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-0398.html>

Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>
