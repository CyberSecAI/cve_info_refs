    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox. Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-3101, CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939, CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)\n\nMozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client. Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3101, CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939, CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)\n\nAbhishek Arya discovered a heap buffer overflow in utf16 to latin1 character set conersion, allowing to execute arbitray code.\n\nSecurity researcher Abhishek Arya of Google used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover several issues: two heap buffer overflow bugs and a use-after-free problem. The first heap buffer overflow was found in conversion from unicode to native character sets when the function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList when working with column layout with absolute positioning in a container that changes size. The second buffer overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState when a window is resized on a page with nested columns and a combination of absolute and relative positioning. All three of these issues are potentially exploitable.\nHeap-buffer-overflow in utf16\\_to\\_isolatin1",

    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "A heap buffer overflow was found in conversion from unicode to native character sets when the function fails.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox/Thunderbird.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Processing malformed web content",
         "Viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed"
      ],
       "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide malformed web content. The vulnerability is exploitable via a specially crafted web page or other content loaded within the affected application."
