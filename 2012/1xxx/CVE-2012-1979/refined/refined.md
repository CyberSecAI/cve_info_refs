Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper input sanitization of the "email" parameter in SyndeoCMS version 3.0.01 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "email" field when updating a user profile. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed in the browsers of other users viewing the affected profile.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When another user or administrator views the profile of the compromised user, the injected XSS code will be executed in their browser. This allows the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack is carried out through the "starnet/index.php" page using an HTTP POST method.
-  An authenticated user with the ability to modify their profile settings is required.
-  The malicious script is injected into the "Email address" field under the user's profile edit page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the SyndeoCMS application.
-  They need the privilege to modify their own user profile settings, specifically the email field.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is persistent because the injected script is stored in the database and executed whenever the profile is viewed.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates an alert box being triggered to demonstrate the XSS.
- The vulnerability is present in version 3.0.01 and lower.
