Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2012-1545 (though the CVE description itself is a placeholder):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from two previously unknown bugs in Internet Explorer 9 running on Windows 7 SP1.
*   Specifically, a heap overflow was used to bypass DEP and ASLR, and a memory corruption vulnerability was exploited in tandem to break out of the sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** A heap overflow vulnerability allowed attackers to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Memory Corruption:** A memory corruption vulnerability allowed the attackers to further their exploit.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** The combination of the vulnerabilities enabled the attackers to escape Internet Explorer's Protected Mode (sandbox).
*   **Insufficient Security Mitigations:** The Protected Mode (sandbox) in IE9 was not as robust as the one found in Chrome, with the article stating that it's easier to escape the IE sandbox, making it more susceptible to these types of attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation allowed attackers to take complete control of the underlying system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers could remotely execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. The article mentions the exploit demonstrated by remotely opening a calculator program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** The attack was conducted via the web browser, requiring a user to browse to a malicious page or interact with malicious web content.
*   **Exploitation of IE Code:** The exploit focused on vulnerabilities within Internet Explorer's code, and did not require third party plugins or kernel code, which simplifies exploitation.
*    **Multiple Vulnerabilities:** The attackers combined a heap overflow, memory corruption and a sandbox escape to achieve their goal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Sophisticated Exploit Development:** The attackers (Vupen Security) demonstrated advanced knowledge of exploit techniques, including bypassing DEP, ASLR, and sandbox mechanisms.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attack could be initiated remotely, requiring a user to visit or interact with a malicious webpage

**Additional Details:**

*   The content highlights that even fully patched systems are susceptible to compromise, reinforcing the need for strong security practices.
*   The attack was demonstrated at the Pwn2Own hacking contest.
*   The article speculates, based on clues, that Adobe Flash may have been involved in the sandbox escape in the related attack on Chrome, but the IE exploit is described as being 100% IE code.
*   The article notes that the Protected Mode in the beta version of IE 10 running on Windows 8 was improved to provide better security with mitigations against use-after-free bugs.

In summary, the vulnerability described involves a combination of weaknesses in IE9's memory handling and its Protected Mode implementation, allowing remote attackers to gain complete control over a fully patched system.
