Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect loop construct within the `_zip_readcdir` function in `zip_open.c` of libzip, specifically when handling zip files with a zero number of directory entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** When the number of directory entries is zero, the code allocates zero bytes of memory for directory entries. Subsequently, a `do-while` loop attempts to write directory entry data to the allocated memory which results in a heap buffer overflow by writing beyond the allocated memory because it does not account for the zero-byte allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious zip file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ZIP File:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker crafting a specially crafted ZIP file that has a zero number of directory entries or other specific properties that trigger this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open this malicious file using an application utilizing the vulnerable libzip library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify zip files.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to open the crafted malicious file.
*   No specific privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `_zip_readcdir` function within `zip_open.c`
* The specific code snippet related to the loop is:
```c
(260)    do {
(261)        if ((_zip_dirent_read(cd->entry+i, fp, bufp, &left, 0, error)) < 0) {
             ...
(277)    } while (i<cd->nentry && left > 0);
```

* The affected versions of libzip are 0.10 and earlier.
* PHP (versions 5.4.0 and <= 5.3.10) and the Ruby binding zipruby (version <= 0.3.6) were initially thought to be affected but later analysis shows they included older versions of libzip that were not affected
* This vulnerability is exploitable remotely by having the user open a specially crafted zip file.
* The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information leaks.
