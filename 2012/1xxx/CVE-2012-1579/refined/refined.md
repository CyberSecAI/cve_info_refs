{
  "CVE-2012-1579": {
    "Description": "The resource loader in MediaWiki 1.18 and later can leak certain kinds of private data, such as CSRF protection tokens, across domain origin boundaries by providing the data as an executable JavaScript file. This allows for the compromise of user accounts by changing the user's email address and then requesting a password reset.",
    "Root cause": "The MediaWiki resource loader did not properly restrict access to private modules, allowing them to be loaded remotely and exposing sensitive data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens can be leaked.",
      "Private data exposed through a resource loader.",
      "Insufficient access control on resource loader modules."
    ],
    "Impact": "Compromise of user accounts by stealing CSRF tokens, which can then be used to change the user's email address and initiate a password reset.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can load a private module remotely by crafting a specific URL, thereby gaining access to sensitive data, such as the CSRF token.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make a user's browser load a crafted URL that includes a request for a private module via load.php."
