Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1122:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect access checks performed when moving bugs between projects in MantisBT. Specifically, when a user attempts to move a bug from one project to another, the system incorrectly uses the `report_bug_threshold` from the source project instead of the target project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the flawed logic in the access control check, leading to a bypass of intended permissions.
*   **Logic Error:** The code responsible for moving bugs uses the wrong project context for evaluating access levels.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users could move bugs into projects where they do not have the permission to create or report bugs. This effectively allows users to bypass intended access restrictions, potentially revealing sensitive information to users who should not have access.
*   **Data Manipulation:** By moving bugs, users may potentially affect the organization and accessibility of the bug tracking system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the standard web interface where users initiate a bug move operation.
*   **User Action:** The attacker needs to use the "move bug" functionality to exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MantisBT User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user in the MantisBT system with the basic ability to view and interact with bug reports.
*   **Access to Bug:** The attacker needs to have access to at least one bug and be able to view the page with the move option.
*   **Move Bug Privilege:** The attacker must have the 'move\_bug\_threshold' permission to initiate the move action in the source project.
*   **Awareness of Target Project:** The attacker must be aware of the target project and its permissions configuration for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in MantisBT versions prior to 1.2.9.
*   The issue was identified and fixed with a code change in `bug_actiongroup.php`, specifically changing the access check logic to use the `report_bug_threshold` of the target project instead of the source project.

In summary, CVE-2012-1122 describes an access control vulnerability where incorrect permission checks during bug moves in MantisBT could be exploited by registered users to gain unauthorized access and move bugs to projects they should not have access to.
