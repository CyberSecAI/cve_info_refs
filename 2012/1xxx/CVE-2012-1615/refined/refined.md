Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrectly configured D-Bus policy file (`org.fedoraproject.sectool.mechanism.conf`) included with the `sectool` package. This file grants excessive permissions to users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect D-Bus Policy:** The policy file contains a broad `allow send_type="method_call"` directive without a specific destination. This allows any user to make method calls to any service, effectively bypassing intended restrictions.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a regular user could perform actions that are normally restricted to administrative users, such as restarting system services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users could gain elevated privileges and perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Service Disruption:** Users could restart or manipulate system services, potentially causing denial of service or other disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable `sectool` package is installed.
*   **D-Bus Interaction:** The attacker would exploit the overly permissive D-Bus policy by sending D-Bus method calls to privileged services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a regular user on the system.
*   No prior administrative privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability once `sectool` is installed.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was identified by Colin Guthrie.
*   The issue was triggered by the presence of the `org.fedoraproject.sectool.mechanism.conf` file in the `/etc/dbus-1/system.d/` directory.
*   The fix was implemented by removing the `allow send_type="method_call"` line or restricting it to only the intended destination service in the D-Bus configuration file.
*   The vulnerability was present in `sectool` versions prior to 0.9.5-7.fc16 and 0.9.5-7.fc17.
*   Patched versions were released for Fedora 16 and 17.
