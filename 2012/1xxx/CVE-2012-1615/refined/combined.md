# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c0)  Mathieu Bridon    2012-04-03 11:33:48 UTC  ``` My user is in the wheel group:   $ id   uid=1000(mathieu) gid=1000(mathieu) groups=1000(mathieu),10(wheel),990(mock)   context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023  It's not a super user:   $ systemctl status crond.service   crond.service - Command Scheduler 	  Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/crond.service; enabled) 	  Active: active (running) since Mon, 02 Apr 2012 09:48:36 +0800; 1 day and 9h ago 	Main PID: 888 (crond)   $ systemctl restart crond.service   Failed to issue method call: Access denied  But it's an "administrator" for PolicyKit and sudo:   $ sudo systemctl restart crond.service   [sudo] password for mathieu:    $ systemctl status crond.service   crond.service - Command Scheduler 	  Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/crond.service; enabled) 	  Active: active (running) since Tue, 03 Apr 2012 19:22:27 +0800; 4s ago 	Main PID: 9932 (crond)   [... snip ...]  Now, after I install sectool, things change:   $ systemctl restart crond.service   $ systemctl status crond.service   crond.service - Command Scheduler 	  Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/crond.service; enabled) 	  Active: active (running) since Tue, 03 Apr 2012 19:23:02 +0800; 1s ago 	Main PID: 9954 (crond)   [... snip ...]   It doesn't seem right that installing a package suddenly grants my user new permissions.  This was first observed by Colin (CC-ed) on Mageia, but I can confirm it also happens on Fedora 16 with sectool-0.9.5-4.fc15.x86_64.rpm   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c1)  Michal Schmidt    2012-04-03 11:47:08 UTC  ``` Colin also identified the specific file that causes it: org.fedoraproject.sectool.mechanism.conf  When the file is moved away from /etc/dbus-1/system.d/, the bug goes away.  I suspect this piece:   <policy context="default">       <allow ...something... />       <allow send_type="method_call"/>   </policy>  I don't know the DBus language, but I assume the two <allow> directives are treated independently. So any method calls to anything get allowed :-)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c2)  Colin Guthrie    2012-04-03 12:00:48 UTC  ``` Yup, that sounds likely Michal (I'm also don't speak DBus policy, so can't offer any more than that!).  Just for clarity, it doesn't matter what groups your user is in. My test user not in the wheel group could quite happily fiddle about with stuff. This would appear to tie in with Michal's observations too.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c3)  Jaroslav Reznik    2012-04-03 14:07:05 UTC  ``` I expect the two allow directives has the desired meaning only while combined in one <allow send_destination="org.fedoraproject.sectool.mechanism" send_type="method_call"/>. This would mean - allow method_call for destination .sectool (but see later).  Because according to dbus-daemon manual page, method_call is denied by default. But "The <deny> element's attributes determine whether the deny "matches" a particular action. If it matches, the action is denied *(unless later rules in the config file allow it)*.". So the allow send_type without a specific destination overrides it.  I checked .conf files for other PK based mechanisms and it's not needed to allow method_call, it's allowed just by allow send_destination. Then the easiest fix is to remove the offending line, sectool works and there's no privileges escalations. I just wonder in how many other dbus services we can find this...  Man page: <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-daemon.1.html>  Btw. it's just my observation and it's not clear from man page and I don't speak DBus policy language neither :)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c4)  Fedora Update System    2012-04-03 14:54:35 UTC  ``` sectool-0.9.5-7.fc17 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 17. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/sectool-0.9.5-7.fc17>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c5)  Fedora Update System    2012-04-03 15:26:55 UTC  ``` sectool-0.9.5-7.fc16 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 16. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/sectool-0.9.5-7.fc16>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-03 22:49:50 UTC  ``` Looks like the patch to fix this is here:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=sectool.git;a=blob;f=sectool-0.9.5-dbus.patch;h=aedb3ef7f7e5ab22d5438bfb7eee63489ccf3244;hb=4859832281f0e08c6fbe48fc252c4199a0e9e322>  But is not yet upstream.  We'll need to request a CVE for this.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-03 22:55:28 UTC  ``` CVE request and notification on oss-security:  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/03/8>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c8)  Kurt Seifried    2012-04-04 03:08:36 UTC  ``` Assigned CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/04/2>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=809437#c9)  Fedora Update System    2012-04-06 21:33:01 UTC  ``` sectool-0.9.5-7.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.
