## JPEG 2000 Memory Overwrite Vulnerability in OpenJPEG Could Allow Arbitrary Code Execution

Published: March 20, 2012

**Version:** 1.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting OpenJPEG software version 1.4 and earlier versions. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the affected vendor, OpenJPEG. OpenJPEG has remediated the vulnerability in their software.

The vulnerability exists in the way that the JPEG 2000 codec, included with OpenJPEG, handles allocation of memory when parsing specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with OpenJPEG to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability has been assigned the entry, CVE-2012-1499, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, including information about updates from OpenJPEG, see the [project homepage](https://code.google.com/p/openjpeg/).

#### Mitigating Factors

* This vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

### Advisory Details

#### Purpose and Recommendation

**Purpose of Advisory:** To notify users of a vulnerability and its remediation.

**Advisory Status:** Advisory published.

**Recommendation:** Review the **Suggested Actions** section and configure as appropriate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of this advisory?**

This advisory is part of a coordinated release with affected vendors to inform customers of a security issue that may affect their systems.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

No. This vulnerability has been addressed via an update from the affected third-party vendors. The update remediates the software listed in the table, **Affected Software**.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A CMAP record controlled write to OpenJPEG creates a situation where an out of bounds memory write occurs. This situation could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory locations, creating the possibility for code execution.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file with an affected version of OpenJPEG. Typically these specially crafted files are delivered via social engineering techniques in email, instant messaging, or via download links on websites. This vulnerability cannot be exploited without user interaction.

## Suggested Actions

Download and use the latest version of OpenJPEG available from the [OpenJPEG download page](https://code.google.com/p/openjpeg/downloads/list).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=805912#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-22 12:45:53 UTC  ``` An out-of heap-based buffer write flaw was found in the way JP2, the JPEG-2000 file format reader / writer of the OpenJPEG, an open-source JPEG 2000 codec, performed processing of palette information, present in JP2 Header Box for certain JPEG 2000 format images. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG 2000 format image file with specially-crafted value of palette index, which once processed by the JPEG 2000 decoder would leak to JPEG 2000 decoder crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the decoder.

| [Description](#c0)  Paul B. Davis    2004-02-08 19:32:41 UTC  ``` gedit works fine when only one file at a time is opened.  If I try to open a second text file, a window pops up with the following text:  Application "gedit" (process xxxx) has crashed due to a fatal error. (Aborted)  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open "Text Editor" from the applications menu 2. Open a text file 3. Open a second text file  Actual Results:   Application "gedit" (process wxyz) has crashed due to a fatal error. (Aborted)  Expected Results:   The software should have opened the second text file in a seconed tab. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Yi Quang (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-08 19:44:59 UTC  ``` Uh, your bug report tells us nothing about what kind of system you have.  Please provide the version of gedit, your emerge info, and a backtrace.  We can't do anything with this bug report.   ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Paul B. Davis    2004-02-09 19:24:15 UTC  ``` I'll get back to you with that information as soon as possible.  Sorry to waste your time...this is my first bug report and I must have missed the part of the documentation that explained what information was needed. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Paul B. Davis    2004-02-09 23:43:37 UTC  ``` OK...  This bug happens on my Athlon64 3000+ system.  I have 1 GB RAM, a Gigabyte K8N Pro motherboard, a GeForce2 GTS and a generic TNT2.  I am using the "nvidia" driver, and the same problem appears under the "nv" driver.  I will attach a backtrace and my "emerge info" after this post.  If I type in "gedit" in an xterm, and follow the steps outlined above, this is dumped to the console:  elric root # gedit   GLib-ERROR **: gmem.c:140: failed to allocate 206158446161 bytes aborting... elric root #  My version of app-editors/gedit is 2.4.0 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Paul B. Davis    2004-02-09 23:45:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25318](attachment.cgi?id=25318 "backtrace from gedit 2.4.0 \"multiple file crash\"") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=25318&action=edit "backtrace from gedit 2.4.0 \"multiple file crash\"")] backtrace from gedit 2.4.0 "multiple file crash" ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Paul B. Davis    2004-02-09 23:47:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25319](attachment.cgi?id=25319 "the output of the \"emerge info\" command") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=25319&action=edit "the output of the \"emerge info\" command")] the output of the "emerge info" command ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Darryl Bleau    2004-03-08 09:50:44 UTC  ``` I can also confirm this bug, I've been trying to get my gedit to behave for a few weeks now, and haven't found any answers so far.  The problem is exactly the same as Paul describes, and it's possibly a AMD64 thing as I am also running a AMD64 processor.  gedit outputs:  GLib-ERROR **: gmem.c:140: failed to allocate 206158430919 bytes aborting...  (What is that.. 206 gigs?)  I would also note that the problem is not limited to multiple files, you get the same error if you try to open a file from the command line ('gedit file.txt' will crash the same). In fact, the only way I can get gedit to open a file is by starting gedit, the using file/open. But it will only open one. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-08 13:52:52 UTC  ``` [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38091](show_bug.cgi?id=38091 "RESOLVED FIXED - could not launch gedit from console with a filename as argument")  check if that patch fixes it ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Darryl Bleau    2004-03-08 14:26:03 UTC  ``` that does seem to fix it.  not sure if it's a good way (gsize -> int) but that doesn't really matter to me, as long as it works :) ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Jason Huebel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-09 18:23:05 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [38091](show_bug.cgi?id=38091 "RESOLVED FIXED - could not launch gedit from console with a filename as argument") *** ``` |  |
