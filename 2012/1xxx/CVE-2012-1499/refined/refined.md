Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1499:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory overwrite issue in the way the JPEG 2000 codec (specifically within the `jp2.c` file) of OpenJPEG handles memory allocation while parsing specially crafted files. A CMAP record controlled write leads to an out-of-bounds memory write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:**  The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds memory write, where the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer. This occurs when processing palette information in certain JPEG 2000 images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable software.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- **Data Manipulation/Account Creation:** Attackers can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As a less severe consequence, the vulnerability can also cause a crash of the decoder, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted JPEG 2000 Files:**  The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file. Specifically, the crafted file includes a manipulated palette index within the JP2 Header Box.
- **User Interaction Required:** The exploit requires a user to open a malicious JPEG 2000 file, often delivered via:
    - Email attachments.
    - Links on malicious websites.
    - Compromised websites hosting malicious content.
    - Instant messaging

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, and the vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted file hosted on a web server or sent via email.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the specially crafted file using social engineering techniques.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenJPEG versions 1.4 and earlier.
- OpenJPEG version 1.5 and later are not affected.
- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR).
-  Red Hat confirms that the version of OpenJPEG shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was not vulnerable.
-   The vulnerability is also referenced with MSVR12-004 and MSVR-11-117.
