# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

===============================================================================================
Open-Realty CMS 2.5.8 (2.x.x) <= "select\_users\_template" Local File Inclusion Vulnerability
===============================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
Open-Realty 2.5.8 and lower versions are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.
2. BACKGROUND
Open-Realty is the world's leading real estate listing marketing and management CMS application, and has enjoyed being the real estate web site software of choice for professional web site developers since 2002.
3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
Open-Realty contains a flaw that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code. The issue is due to the 'index.php' script not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied to the 'select\_users\_template' parameter. This may allow an attacker to include a file from the targeted host that contains arbitrary commands or code that will be executed by the vulnerable script. Such attacks are limited due to the script only calling files already on the target host. In addition, this flaw can potentially be used to disclose the contents of any file on the system accessible by the web server.
4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
2.5.8 (2.x.x) <=
5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT
http://localhost/open-realty2.5.8/?select\_users\_template=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
6. SOLUTION
The version 2.5.x version family is no longer maintained by the vendor.
The version 3.x.x is not found to be vulnerable to this issue. Upgrade to the latest 3.x.x version.
7. VENDOR
Transparent Technologies Inc.

9. DISCLOSURE TIME-LINE
2012-03-05: Open-Realty 2.5.8 in End-of-Support/Maintenance circle
2012-03-05: Vulnerability disclosed
