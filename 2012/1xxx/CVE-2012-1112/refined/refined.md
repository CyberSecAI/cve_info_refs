Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1112

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the `index.php` script in Open-Realty CMS not properly sanitizing user input. Specifically, it does not handle directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../..`) provided to the `select_users_template` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, stemming from the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to include files from the server's file system.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The web application fails to validate and sanitize the `select_users_template` parameter, allowing for directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server that the webserver has access to, potentially leaking sensitive data like configuration files, database credentials, or source code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `select_users_template` GET parameter in a URL.
- **Directory Traversal:** The attacker uses `../` sequences to navigate to files outside the intended web directory.
- **Null Byte Injection:** A null byte `%00` is used at the end of the file path to terminate the path and prevent further traversal or extension being added.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Open-Realty CMS instance.
- **Knowledge of System Paths:** Some knowledge of system paths could assist in exploiting specific targets
- **No authentication is mentioned**

**Affected Versions:**
- Open-Realty CMS versions 2.5.8 and lower (2.x.x series).

**Mitigation:**
- The 2.5.x branch is no longer maintained, therefore the vendor recommends upgrading to a 3.x.x version.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit URL that demonstrates how to read the `/etc/passwd` file, confirming LFI vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program) and CAPEC-252 (PHP Local File Inclusion).
