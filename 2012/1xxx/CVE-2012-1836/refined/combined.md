## InspIRCd heap corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#212651

Original Release Date: 2012-03-19 | Last Revised: 2012-04-09

---

### Overview

InspIRCd 2.0.5 and possibly other versions contain a heap corruption vulnerability that may be exploited with a specifically crafted DNS query.

### Description

| InspIRCd contains a heap corruption vulnerability that exists in the dns.cpp code. The res[] buffer is allocated on the heap and can be overflowed. The res[] buffer can be exploited during its deallocation. The number of overflowed bytes can be controlled with DNS compression features. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the InspIRCd service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  InspIRCd 1.2.9 RC1, 2.0.6 RC1, and 2.1.0 B3 have addressed this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Configuration Change**  The issue may be mitigated in some scenarios by changing your configuration file so <performance:nouserdns> is set to yes. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : inspircd
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1836
Debian Bug     : 667914

It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow in InspIRCd could allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS query.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.22+dfsg-4+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.22+dfsg-4+wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.5-0.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.
