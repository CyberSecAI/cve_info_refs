## ICC profile I/O library (icclib), README file

Date 22 September 2012, Version 2.14

This version is part of Argyll
V 1.40

This distribution contains source code which implements the
reading
and writing of color profile files that conform to the
International
Color
Consortium (ICC) Profile Format Specification, Version 3.4.

For more information about the ICC, and for copies of the
specification,
please refer to [http://www.color.org/.](http://www.color.org)

(Note that this software is written from the ICC V3.4 standard,
but
the software and its author are not affiliated with, or otherwise
connected
with the ICC.)

Motivation

Color is still very much a black art to many programmers dealing
with
computer graphics. The ICC Profile Format is an industry attempt
to
provide
an interchange format to help solve the problems of specifying
color,
and
in transferring color graphics from, and between systems and
devices.
Although
the ICC format has been around a number of years, and has long
been
adopted
by companies in the business of providing systems for publishing
and
printing,
and is now widely used as part of commercial operating system
support
for
device independent color, its uptake in the general world of
computer
graphics
has been slow.

The writing of this library was prompted by my private and
professional
enthusiasm for computer graphics, and color. Inspired by other
examples
of freely usable software (notably the Independent JPEG Group's
free
JPEG
software, and Sam Leffler's TIFF library), I have decided to make
this
library available under similar terms.  I hope that this
library
will
provide a starting point for including ICC profile support more
widely
that is currently the case, particularly in open source code
projects.

Overview

This package contains a C software implementation of the ICC
Profile
Format, Version 3.4. The ICC Profile Format attempts to provide a
cross-platform
device profile format, that can be used to translate color data
created
on one device into another device's native color space. For a
fuller
explanation
of what the ICC Profile Format is all about, please refer to [http://www.color.org](http://www.color.org/),
and the profile specification.

In summary this library provides:

> - Full source code, free for commercial and non-commercial use.
> - Support for all version 3.4 header elements, Tags and Tag Types.
> - Conversion to/from machine native representation of all data
>   types.
> - Support for user defined Tags.
> - Support for adding/deleting Tags.
> - Support for Tag type sharing within a file (often used for
>   sharing LUTs
>   amongst intents).
> - Support for reading/writing embedded profiles, including from/to
>   a
>   memory
>   buffer, rather than a file.
> - Provides a single function for transforming color values through
>   a
>   profile,
>   including support for intents, forward and reverse transforms,
>   gamut
>   lookup
>   or preview lookup.
> - Provides support and code examples for creating all profile
>   types,
>   monochrome,
>   matrix and Lut.
> - Attempts to be platform neutral, and flexibility in its use of
>   system
>   file
>   and memory sub-systems.
> - Loads Tag Types on demand to conserve memory space.

Changes from V2.11

Many changes have been made to support ArgyllCMS. A double memory
free bug when iccdump'ing a profile that has duplicate tags has
been fixed.

Package contents:

| icclib.zip | ZIP archive of the following files |
| --- | --- |
| README.txt | This file. |
| Licence.txt | Important! - Permissions for use of this package. |
| icc.c | Library source file. |
| iccstd.c | Library source that uses stdio and malloc system calls. |
| icc.h | Library include file. Note machine dependent defines. Includes icc9809.h. |
| icc9809.h | Lightly modified standard ICC header file. |
| iccdump.c | Program that dumps ASCII description of a profile. |
| icclu.c | Program that allows interactive or batch translation of color values though a profile. |
| icctest.c | Basic library tag Read/Write example and regression test code. |
| lutest.c | Color lookup regression test code, and example for creating color profiles. |
| iccrw.c | Source code skeleton for reading and then re-writing a profile. |
| Jamfile | JAM style "makefile" see <http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html> |
| Makefile | Generic style makefile. Edit this to select the appropriate system makefile rules. |
| Makefile.IBMNT | Makefile ruleset for Windows NT using the IBM compiler. |
| Makefile.OSX | Makefile ruleset for Mac OSX environment. |
| Makefile.UNIX | Makefile ruleset for Linux style environment. |
| Makefile.WNT | Makefile ruleset for Windows NT using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. |

Style

For handling convenience, I have included all the library source
code
in two files. The down side is that they are both hard to read and
navigate
through. The code could do with some cleaning up and
rearrangement, to
make clear the distinction between public and private elements.
(C++
would
help here, but is less portable.) The code attempts to be ANSI C
compliant,
written in an object oriented style.  A tutorial on how to
use the
library would also be a good thing !

The best way to learn how to use the library, is to take a look
at
icctest.c,
lutest.c and iccrw.c. The first is used to test writing and
reading to
every type of element, with every possible variation of usage. You
will
need a copy of the ICC spec. handy to understand what it all
means. The
second source file specifically creates and then tests various
types of
profiles, including monochrome, matrix and Lut style profiles. The
last
is a source code skeleton, that reads a profile completely into
memory,
and then writes it out again to a different file.

With the release of version 2.00 of icclib, the library is now as
useful
as it is likely to be, allowing convenient color conversion
between PCS
(profile connection spaces, either XYZ or Lab) and device specific
color
spaces. The library does not attempt to be a complete color
management
system however, lacking profile creation and linking
functionality.
Icclib
is part of the [Argyll CMS](argyllcms.html), which does
attempt to be a complete color management system. Argyll can be
used as
a more realistic example of the use of icclib. I plan at some
stage to
upgrade icclib to be compatible with the recently released ICC V4
spec.,
but will probably get around to this sometime after the next major
release
of Argyll.

I welcome feedback, positive or negative, so please mail me at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=809697#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-04 05:56:53 UTC  ``` A Use-after-free vulnerability was found in the way icclib, a library used for reading and writing of color profile files that conform to the International Color Consortium (ICC) Profile Format Specification, processed certain crafted ICC profile files. The ICC Profile Format is a cross-platform device profile format that can be used to translate color data created on one device into another device's native color space.   A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted file and trick a local user into opening it, which could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running an application linked against icclib.  Red Hat would like to thank Marc Schoenefeld for reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=809697#c10)  Huzaifa S.

# ArgyllCMS: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201206-04**

A vulnerability has been found in ArgyllCMS which could allow
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/argyllcms** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.0** |

### Background

ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system that supports
accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, cameras and film recorders.

### Description

ArgyllCMS does not properly handle ICC profiles causing a use-after-free
vulnerability.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image
file using ArgyllCMS, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the process, or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All argyllcms users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/argyllcms-1.4.0"

```
