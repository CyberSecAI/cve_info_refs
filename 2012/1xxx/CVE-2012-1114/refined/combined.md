| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-05 10:26:21 UTC  ``` Originally (2012-03-01), the following cross-site (XSS) flaws were reported against LDAP Account Manager Pro (from Secunia advisory [1]): * 1) Input passed to e.g. the "filteruid" POST parameter when filtering result sets in lam/templates/lists/list.php (when "type" is set to a valid value) is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  * 2) Input passed to the "filter" POST parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "export" and "exporter_id" is set to "LDIF") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  * 3) Input passed to the "attr" parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "add_value_form" and "dn" is set to a valid value) is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  References: [1] <http://secunia.com/advisories/48221/> [2] <http://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=458>  Later (2012-03-03), it was reported: [3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=662050#15>  that subset (for 'export', 'add_value_form', and 'dn' variables) of these security flaws is applicable also against the code of PhpLDAPadmin, a web-based LDAP client.

Please schedule an update.  --  These issues affect the versions of the phpldapadmin package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 6 and Fedora EPEL 5 (though the latter one might require the proposed patches above to be backported to older PhpLDAPAdmin version being present).

Please use CVE-2012-1114 for these two issues (XSS, same reporter)

Please use CVE-2012-1115 for this vu;n (XSS, but different reporter)

yes.

phpLDAPadmin is vulnerable to i, ii and iii.

Regarding the filteruid problem I cannot reproduce this. The variable is properly sanitized.
This is a LAM only thing.

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Harrison    2012-03-10 20:35:06 UTC  ``` Input passed via the "filter" and "attr" parameters to cmd.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  Input passed to the "filter" POST parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "export" and "exporter_id" is set to "LDIF") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  Input passed to the "attr" parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "add_value_form" and "dn" is set to a valid value) is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/06/1>  $URL referenced the above descriptions detail from numbers [2] and [3]: <http://secunia.com/advisories/48221/>  It looks like Secunia's advisory is implying that the above is the same issue but with phpldapadmin specifically since it has been issued it's own CVE.  Looks as though, per upstream there is currently no solution: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3497660&group_id=61828&atid=498546> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Samuel Damashek (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-12-22 14:23:14 UTC  ``` Vulnerability is fixed in =net-nds/phpldapadmin-1.2.3 (commit #74434e5 in git://git.code.sf.net/p/phpldapadmin/code). Would it be possible for <net-nds/phpldapadmin-1.2.3 to be removed from the tree and this bug closed?

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- LDAP Account Manager Pro / PhpLDAPadmin -- Multiple XSS flaws

Thank you for your reply and the ids, Kurt.

Since you didn't explicitly mention CVE identifiers
for phpLDAPAdmin, checking with you yet.

Can we consider the CVE-2012-1114, CVE-2012-1115
identifiers below to be valid also for phpLDAPAdmin code?

According to Roland's reply:
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/06/1>

contains a reduced copy of phpLDAPAdmin's code.

Though we issue only one CVE identifier for the original
source code and can use that one also for projects, embedding
that source, not sure the current situation wrt to these
two is the correct one.

Roland, could you clarify, if phpLDAPAdmin code would be vulnerable
to all issues listed for LDAP Account Manager too or if phpLDAPAdmin
would be vulnerable only for XSS issues when processing:
i)   'export',
ii)  'add_value_form'
iii)  and 'dn' variables?

And LDAP Account Manager would be vulnerable yet to additional
XSS flaws, due improper sanitization of 'filteruid', 'type',
and 'cmd' variables? (and these would be LDAP Account Manager
specific)

Because, if the latter is the case, I would propose the
CVE-2012-1114, CVE-2012-1115 identifiers to be used for phpLDAPAdmin
issues, and that we would assign new one for LDAP Account Manager
ones.

Any clarification here, which source code base is affected by
which issue exactly is appreciated.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Please use CVE-2012-1114 for these two issues (XSS, same reporter)

Please use CVE-2012-1115 for this vu;n (XSS, but different reporter)
