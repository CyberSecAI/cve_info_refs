Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the LDAP Account Manager (LAM) Pro 3.6 and phpLDAPadmin applications. This allows for the injection of malicious code into the application's output, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. User-provided data in specific parameters is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session in the context of the affected site. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Theft of sensitive data
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs that include the payload in the following parameters:
    - `filter` parameter in `cmd.php` (when `cmd` is set to `export` and `exporter_id` is set to `LDIF`)
     - `filteruid` parameter in `list.php`
     - `attr` parameter in `cmd.php` (when `cmd` is set to `add_value_form` and `dn` is set to a valid value)
- These URLs can then be delivered to victims through various methods such as phishing emails or malicious links on other websites.
- When the victim opens this crafted link, their browser will execute the malicious script within the context of the vulnerable web application, giving the attacker access and control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs, but no specific privileges are required on the server.
- The attacker needs to entice a victim into clicking on the specially crafted URLs for the XSS to be triggered.
- No direct access to the vulnerable server is required.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects both LDAP Account Manager Pro 3.6 and phpLDAPadmin as they share some vulnerable code.
- The vulnerability was identified in March 2012 and patches were created for LDAP Account Manager. These patches were applicable to phpLDAPadmin as well
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity (CVSS score 6.1).
- Patches are available to fix this issue.
