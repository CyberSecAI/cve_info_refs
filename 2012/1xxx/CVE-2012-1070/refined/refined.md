The provided content is related to CVE-2012-1070.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause for the vulnerabilities described is related to insufficient input sanitization and improper handling of user-supplied data in multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions. This lack of proper input validation allows for the exploitation of vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Arbitrary Code Execution, and information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Open Redirection
- Arbitrary Code Execution
- Information Disclosure
- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
-   **Data breaches:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
-   **Website defacement:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts to modify the website's appearance and behavior.
-   **Redirection to malicious sites:** Attackers could redirect users to phishing or malware sites.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server.
-   **Information disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information.
-   **CSRF**: Attackers could execute unwanted actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities are exploitable via web requests to the vulnerable extensions. Attackers could inject malicious SQL queries through input fields, inject malicious scripts into web pages via vulnerable parameters, or exploit open redirect vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the vulnerable extensions. For some vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and XSS, no authentication is required, while for others such as arbitrary code execution, some level of authentication may be required (backend user). For CSRF, the user has to be logged in and tricked into clicking a malicious link.

**Affected extensions and their specific vulnerabilities:**
-   `mv_cooking`: SQL Injection (Critical)
-   `toi_category`: SQL Injection, XSS (Critical)
-   `mm_whtppr`: SQL Injection (Critical)
-   `rtg_files`: XSS, SQL Injection (High)
-   `bc_post2facebook`: XSS, SQL Injection (High)
-   `sysutils`: Information Disclosure (High)
-   `typo3_webservice`: Arbitrary Code Execution (High)
-   `css_filelinks`: XSS (Low)
-   `irfaq`: Open Redirection, XSS (Medium)
-   `skt_eurocalc`: XSS (Medium)
-   `ya_googlesearch`: XSS (Medium)
-   `terminal`: XSS, CSRF (Low)
-   `beuserswitch`: XSS, Information Disclosure (Low)
-    `jftcaforms`: XSS (Low)
-    `aeurltool`: XSS (Low)

The advisory also notes that some extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the authors failing to provide security fixes.
