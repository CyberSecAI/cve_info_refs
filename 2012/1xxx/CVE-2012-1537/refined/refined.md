    "VulnerabilityDetails": {
      "RootCause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows DirectPlay fails to properly handle specially crafted office documents.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap overflow in DirectPlay"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
       "AttackVectors": [
        "An attacker could send a specially crafted Office document with embedded content to the user and convince the user to open the file."
      ],
      "RequiredCapabilities": [
          "The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file.",
          "An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user."
        ],
      "AffectedSoftware": [
        "Windows XP Service Pack 3",
        "Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2",

    },
    "Mitigations": [
      "Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "The specially crafted Office document could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "By default, the DirectPlay ActiveX control is not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer. Only customers who have explicitly approved this control by using the ActiveX opt-in feature are at risk from attempts to exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
    "Workarounds": [
      "Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Word 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations",
      "Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations",
      "Prevent ActiveX controls from running in Office 2007 and Office 2010",
      "Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources"
      ],
    "FAQ": [
       "What is the scope of the vulnerability? This is a remote code execution vulnerability.",
       "What causes the vulnerability? The vulnerability is caused when Windows DirectPlay fails to properly handle specially crafted office documents.",
       "What is the component affected by the vulnerability? The component affected by this vulnerability is Microsoft DirectX (DirectX 9.0 on all supported editions of Windows XP; DirectX 10.1 on all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008; DirectX 11.0 on all supported editions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2; and DirectX 11.1 on all supported editions of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012).",
      "What is DirectPlay? DirectPlay is a network protocol that shipped with Microsoft DirectX to help game developers create multi-player networked games without having to implement sophisticated network protocols.",
      "What is DirectX? Microsoft DirectX is a feature of the Windows operating system. It is used for streaming media on Microsoft Windows operating systems to enable graphics and sound when playing games or watching video.",
       "What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do? An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
       "How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office document with embedded content to the user and convincing the user to open the file.",
       "What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability? Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.",
       "What does the update do? The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that DirectPlay handles specially crafted content.",
       "When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed? No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.",
       "When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited? No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued."
