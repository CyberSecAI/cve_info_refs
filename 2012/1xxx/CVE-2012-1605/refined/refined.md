```
Root cause of vulnerability: Missing signature (HMAC) for a request argument
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure Unserialize
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could unserialize arbitrary objects within TYPO3. While code injection might not be directly possible in the TYPO3 core, it might be possible by exploiting objects within third-party extensions
Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious request to a vulnerable component with missing HMAC
Required attacker capabilities/position: No special attacker position is mentioned other than ability to make requests to the vulnerable component
