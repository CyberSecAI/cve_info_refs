Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1181:

**Root Cause:**
- The `mod_fcgid` module in Apache HTTP Server version 2.3.6 has a flaw in the `fcgid_spawn_ctl.c` file. The module incorrectly references the `vhost_id` when determining if a process belongs to the same class, which is used to enforce the `FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass` directive. Specifically, it compares `current_node->vhost_id` with `sconf->vhost_id` instead of `command->vhost_id`. Because of this incorrect comparison, the module fails to properly group processes from the same virtual host, especially when `FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass` is configured within a `<VirtualHost>` block.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect vhost ID comparison:** The module incorrectly compares `vhost_id` causing the process limits to be ignored when set within VirtualHost.
- **Ineffective resource limits:** The `FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass` directive, which is intended to limit the number of FastCGI processes per virtual host, does not work as expected when configured within a `<VirtualHost>` block. The limit is either ignored or only works when configured outside the VirtualHost.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the configured process limits by sending a high number of concurrent requests to a vulnerable virtual host. This results in excessive memory consumption, leading to heavy swapping, and potentially causing the operating system's out-of-memory (OOM) killer to terminate processes, causing a DoS. The DoS can affect other services running on the same host due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending HTTP requests to a web server using the vulnerable `mod_fcgid` module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Apache HTTP server instance.
- **Ability to Generate HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to generate HTTP requests, such as GET requests, to trigger the creation of multiple FastCGI processes. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is fixed in `mod_fcgid` version 2.3.7 (not released), through a patch identified as revision `r1037727` in the Apache SVN repository.
- The patch replaces `sconf->vhost_id` with `command->vhost_id` in the `fcgid_spawn_ctl.c` file, correcting the vhost ID comparison logic.
- Debian has released a security advisory (DSA-2436-1) to address the issue by including the fix in their packages.
- This vulnerability is also tracked in the Apache Bugzilla as bug #49902.
- The issue was initially reported because of the observed excessive RAM usage and server load increases when using mod_fcgid 2.3.6.
