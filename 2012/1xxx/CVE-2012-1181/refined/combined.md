Message-ID: <4F62376C.70600@fifthhorseman.net>

Subject: CVE-request: apache's mod-fcgid does not respect configured FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass
 in VirtualHost

Version 2.3.6 of mod-fcgid (the current published version from ASF
according to [0]) has a known problem that FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass
directives are not honored when they appear inside a VirtualHost stanza.

This is presents a risk for a denial of service because it means that a
remote attacker can violate the intent of the admin and overwhelm the
server running fcgid.

Could a CVE be assigned for this vulnerability?

If the admin declares that a given virtualhost should be limited to X
fastcgi processes (often in order to constrain RAM usage by the vhost),
any remote user can issue X+1 (or 10X, or whatever) concurrent GET
requests, which defeats the documented limit, and can result in heavy
swap or the oom-killer, which can cause a DoS on other services on the host.

This bug has been fixed since the release of 2.3.6 in upstream's svn
(r1037727 of <https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_fcgid/trunk>)
with a narrowly-targeted one-line patch:

But this patch hasn't made it to any released version.

Debian has plans to release a Debian Security Advisory for the issue and
will resolve it with the above patch.

Package        : libapache2-mod-fcgid
Vulnerability  : inactive resource limits
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1181
Debian Bug     : 615814

It was discovered that the Apache FCGID module, a FastCGI implementation,
did not properly enforce the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass resource limit,
rendering this control ineffective and potentially allowing a virtual
host to consume excessive resources.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.

# Introduction[Â¶](#introduction "Permalink")

`mod_fcgid` is a high performance alternative to mod\_cgi or mod\_cgid, which
starts a sufficient number instances of the CGI program to handle
concurrent requests, and these programs remain running to handle further
incoming requests. It is favored by the PHP developers, for example, as a
preferred alternative to running mod\_php in-process, delivering very
similar performance.

# mod\_fcgid 2.3.9 released 2013-10-08[Â¶](#mod_fcgid-239-released-2013-10-08 "Permalink")

The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to announce the release of version 2.3.9 of mod\_fcgid, a FastCGI
implementation for Apache HTTP Server versions 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4. This
version of mod\_fcgid is a security release.

You can get the source from [your local
mirror](/download.cgi#mod_fcgid)

Development of mod\_fcgid can be followed through the
[Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) repositories. For public access
you can use:

```
% svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_fcgid/trunk mod_fcgid

```
# Documentation[Â¶](#documentation "Permalink")

The [mod\_fcgid reference page](mod/mod_fcgid.html) will get you started.

See the
[README-FCGID](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_fcgid/trunk/README-FCGID)
file distributed with the module's source code for additional build and
installation notes.

# Mailing Lists[Â¶](#mailing-lists "Permalink")

Discussions of `mod_fcgid` take place on the [Apache HTTP Server mailing
lists](../lists.html) , including the following:

* [User support and discussion](../lists.html#http-users)
* [Development discussions](../lists.html#http-dev)
* [svn commit logs for httpd, including mod\_fcgid](../lists.html#http-cvs)

# History[Â¶](#history "Permalink")

`mod_fcgid` was created by Ryan Pan (Pan Qingfeng, pqf or Ã¦Â½Â˜Ã¥ÂºÂ†Ã¥Â³Â°) in
2004 as a new FastCGI implementation, and was granted to the ASF as an
Apache HTTP Server subproject in 2009, shepherded by Chris Darroch
(chrisd).

Subject: libapache2-mod-fcgid: FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass ignored in VirtualHost
Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2011 23:09:35 -0500
```
Package: libapache2-mod-fcgid
Version: 2.3.6-1
Severity: normal

When configured in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf, FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass works as expected, provided it is not also defined in any VirtualHost blocks.

If it is *also* defined in a VirtualHost block, then both the limit
defined in the VirtualHost block and the limit defined in
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf are ignored (for the VirtualHost in
which it is defined - for other VirtualHosts, the value in fcgid.conf is
respected).

If it is defined only in a VirtualHost block, it is ignored.

I expect that if it is defined in both places, the definition in the
VirtualHost block would take precedence.

To provide further clarification, I came to these conculsions using the
following method:

 * On the test web server, I ran top, filtered by the user running php

 * I created a simple php test file in the test server's web directory with:

 <?php
 sleep(5);
 ?>

 * I used Apache's benchmark tool with the following arguments:

   ab -c 5 -n 5 <http://test-server/test.php>

   I observed that 5 processes appeared in top.

 * I set the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive to 3, first in
   /etc/apache2/fcgid.conf, and then in
   /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/00-default, and then in both place. After
   each change, I reloaded apache (all processes in top were
   terminated), and then I re-ran the benchmark command and observed the
   number of processes that appeared in top. When the number of
   processes was 3, I concluded it was working as expected. When the
   number was 5, I concluded that it wasn't working properly.

Severity: important
Tags: patch

Hi,

I had this problem today, and I believe I found a bug. Our multi-user server setup is using suexec + mod_fcgid and several virtual hosts.
When debugging this issue, I came to the conclusion that sconf->vhost_id was always equal to 1 while current_node->vhost_id would be different from 1, depending on the virtual host used. I believe one should use command->vhost_id (as the other checks in the same if sentence) for correct grouping of processes.

Due to this bug, the check for FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass setting later in the code would never be reached in the case of vhost_id != 1.

I'm setting the severity of this bug to important because this let's a user go above the defined max processes per class in a multi-user server, possibly causing a  denial-of-service to other users.

Best Regards.
Miguel CabeÃ§a

Thank you Miguel!

This problem has been plaguing us for quite some time.

I just applied your patch and it works.

In my original bug report, I said that FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass works
if it's placed in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf but fails if it
also is placed in a VirtualHost directive.

This was incorrect.

Prior to applying the patch, it seems as though
FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass was ignored no matter where it was placed.

After applying the patch it works both in
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf and in a VrtualHost Directive and
when placed in both (with the VirtualHost Directive taking precedence as
expected).

I'd also like to re-iterate the severity of this bug - in a shared
environment controlling the processes that can be launched by a single
virtualhost is critically important to the security of the machine.

tags 615814 + security patch
thanks

#615814 appears to be an opportunity for a denial of service attack,
since explicitly declared process limits are not respected.

Despite not having yet released 2.3.7, upstream is clearly aware of the
bug in 2.3.6, since they committed a fix for it back in November of
2010 (the same fix provided by Miguel CabeÃ§a):

Fix regression in 2.3.6 which broke process controls when using vhost-
specific configuration.

vhost_id was referenced from the wrong structure, and never matched
unless there were no vhost-specific directives in the vhost of the
request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've prepared an NMU for unstable and i'm uploading it to DELAYED/5 (see
the attached debdiff).

I'd like to offer the same fix for either the security archive or the
next stable point release, since currently debian stable systems running
mod_fcgid are vulnerable to denial of service attacks by memory
exhaustion where this limit is not respected.

Security folks, would you accept this as a security upload for squeeze,
or should i fall back to the release-team for the next point release?  I
don't think i've ever prepared a DSA before, but i'm prepared to learn
if you think that's reasonable.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

# CVE-2012-1181

| **Name** | CVE-2012-1181 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | fcgid\_spawn\_ctl.c in the mod\_fcgid module 2.3.6 for the Apache HTTP Server does not recognize the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive for a virtual host, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of HTTP requests that triggers a process count higher than the intended limit. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c0)  spamik    2010-09-08 22:56:31 UTC  ``` FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass only counts inside virtualhost (or maybe virtualhosts with same ServerName? - which should be none). In original fastcgi implementation MaxProcessesPerClass could be used to limit max number of spawned process for same file (wrapper) thus making it possible to limit also "per virtual/system user". In fcgid such limit can't be established. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c1)  spamik    2010-09-08 23:04:58 UTC  ``` in other words there is still a huge need for "class" to span over multiple virtualhosts. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c2)  Piotr Gackiewicz    2010-11-19 09:16:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c0)) > FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass only counts inside virtualhost (or maybe virtualhosts > with same ServerName? - which should be none). In original fastcgi > implementation MaxProcessesPerClass could be used to limit max number of > spawned process for same file (wrapper) thus making it possible to limit also > "per virtual/system user". In fcgid such limit can't be established.  I fully support this statement. When comparing to mod_fcgid-2.2 process management, ASF version spawns tons of unnecessary processes. Unnecessary at least when using the same FcgidWrapper+PHP for the same system user, just different VirtualHost.  Had to downgrade almost immediately after upgrade, due to server load jumping sky high...  Is there a way to achieve the old mod_fcgid proces management behaviour with proper config directives? If not, I'm unhappily stuck with Ryan Pan version... ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c3)  Jeff Trawick    2010-11-21 21:04:19 UTC  ``` >Had to downgrade almost immediately after upgrade, due to server load jumping sky high...

Server load was not affected by wrong accounting on processess. It is affected by NUMBER of started processess, eating up available RAM, causing excessive swapping...  In mod_fcgid-2.2 processess started by fcgiwrapper were of the same class if they were run with same wrapper by the same owner.  In mod_fcgid-2.3 these processess have different class also if they are run in  different virtual hosts.  with mod_fcgid-2.2 and fcgi wrapper for php, we could serve dozens of virtual hosts (i.e. subdomains) for single customer with single php process. mod_fcgid-2.3 needs dozens of PHP processess to do the same job. That's simple waste as whole virtual host environment goes with http request in fcgi protocol.  I think there shoud be at least alternative for default process management in mod_fcgid-2.3. Maybe optional explicit class name in FcgidWrapper and/or FcgidCmdOptions directive? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c5)  Joost Rohde    2011-07-14 22:15:45 UTC  ``` It looks like this is still happening on a Debian Squeeze system with mod fcgid 2.3.6. Has there been any progress regarding this issue?! I rather not compile the mod myself and go back to 2.2, but if that's the only solution right now i probably have to. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c6)  Joost Rohde    2011-07-16 22:18:54 UTC  ``` Small update: Applying Jeff Trawick's patch (see above) to the Debian mod_fcgid 2.3.6 sources fixed it for me. With this patch FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass now works per vhost again, no matter which user, servername or wrapper is used within that vhost. Probably best to fix this before the mass switches over to 2.3.6 (/7) or a lot of servers will go OOM. Thanks Jeff, u saved the day! ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c7)  pioklo    2011-10-10 09:21:24 UTC  ``` Hello !

Server version: Apache/2.2.16 (Debian) Architecture:   64-bit Server MPM:     Worker  Utilising fcgid_module (shared), 2.3.6-1 (Squeeze stable as of writing).  My story is similar to @Joost I guess.  I've had zero luck trying to make FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass work, either at the Server or Virtual level. I put in some serious effort to get it to work but to no avail. So I think that is another confirmed case of this bug in action.  I apt-get source libapache2-mod-fcgid, applied Jeff's patch listed here (by hand), installed etc and *shit started to work*. Kudos @Jeff for sharing this :)  I was then able to set a default server FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass and then override for specific vhosts too. I am still in the testing phase with my latest cfg's but its looking very promising indeed.  ----  @Miroslav, when I had zero luck with FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass, I moved on to try FcgidCmdOptions but no matter what I tried, I couldn't get any of the potential options to take effect :( Specifically, I tried passing env vars to the wrapper, they were not being set (or I was doing it wrong). I also tried specifying MaxProcesses but that didn't work either.  The docs are not that clear on what to specify as the *command*, apache docs suggest the wrapper but that seems to have no effect. I also tried specificing php5-cgi as the command, also no effect.  I have _NOT_ re-tested FcgidCmdOptions since patching but I doubt that is fixed or perhaps I'm just *doing it wrong*. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=49902#c11)  William A.
