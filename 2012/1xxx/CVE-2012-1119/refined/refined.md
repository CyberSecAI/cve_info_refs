Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1119:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the MantisBT bug copy/clone feature not creating a proper audit trail when copying issues. When a user copies a bug report, the action wasn't logged in the history, making it difficult to track who initiated the copy operation. Furthermore, the copy process duplicated the original bug's history entries with incorrect references.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Audit Trail:** The primary issue was the lack of an audit trail for the copy/clone operation. This means that when a user copied a bug report, there was no record of who performed the action or when it occurred.
*   **Incorrect History Duplication:** When a bug was copied, the history from the original bug was also copied to the new bug, which included wrong IDs, causing confusion as references to notes within the copied issues pointed to original issueâ€™s notes instead.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The lack of an audit trail for bug copying could be exploited in the following way:

*   **Spamming/Disruption:** Authorized users could abuse the copy/clone feature to spam the issue tracker with copies of bugs without any record of who performed the action. This could cause disruption and make it difficult to manage issues.
*   **Lack of Accountability:** Without an audit trail, it's difficult to hold users accountable for their actions and investigate abuse scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**
An authenticated user with the ability to copy bug reports through the web interface is required for the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authorized user with the necessary permissions to copy bugs within the MantisBT system.
