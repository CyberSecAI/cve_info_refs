This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes three new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to 10.0.5ESR fixing various
bugs and security issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-34 Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey,
Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox 12.(CVE-2012-1938)
Christian Holler reported a memory safety problem
that affects Firefox ESR. (CVE-2012-1939)
Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse
Ruderman reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR and Firefox 13. (CVE-2012-1937)
Ken Russell of Google reported a bug in NVIDIA
graphics drivers that they needed to work around in the
Chromium WebGL implementation. Mozilla has done the same in
Firefox 13 and ESR 10.0.5. (CVE-2011-3101)
\*
MFSA 2012-35 Security researcher James Forshaw of
Context Information Security found two issues with the
Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater service introduced
in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows Mozilla's
updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context.
The updater can be called by the Updater Service or
independently on systems that do not use the service. The
second of these issues allows for the updater service to
load an arbitrary local DLL file, which can then be run
with the same system privileges used by the service. Both
of these issues require local file system access to be
exploitable.
Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service
(CVE-2012-1942) Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from
application directory (CVE-2012-1943)
\*
MFSA 2012-36 Security researcher Adam Barth found
that inline event handlers, such as onclick, were no longer
blocked by Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script
blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature
of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were
not fully protected. (CVE-2012-1944)
\*
MFSA 2012-37 Security researcher Paul Stone reported
an attack where an HTML page hosted on a Windows share and
then loaded could then load Windows shortcut files (.lnk)
in the same share. These shortcut files could then link to
arbitrary locations on the local file system of the
individual loading the HTML page. That page could show the
contents of these linked files or directories from the
local file system in an iframe, causing information
disclosure.
This issue could potentially affect Linux machines
with samba shares enabled. (CVE-2012-1945)
\*
MFSA 2012-38 Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find a use-after-free while
replacing/inserting a node in a document. This
use-after-free could possibly allow for remote code
execution. (CVE-2012-1946)
\*
MFSA 2012-39 Security researcher Kaspar Brand found a
flaw in how the Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1
decoder handles zero length items. Effects of this issue
depend on the field. One known symptom is an unexploitable
crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles
zero-length basic constraints, assuming default values for
some types that should be rejected as malformed. These
issues have been addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now
being used by Mozilla. (CVE-2012-0441)
\*
MFSA 2012-40 Security researcher Abhishek Arya of
Google used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover several
issues: two heap buffer overflow bugs and a use-after-free
problem. The first heap buffer overflow was found in
conversion from unicode to native character sets when the
function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList
when working with column layout with absolute positioning
in a container that changes size. The second buffer
overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState when a window is
resized on a page with nested columns and a combination of
absolute and relative positioning. All three of these
issues are potentially exploitable.
Heap-buffer-overflow in utf16\_to\_isolatin1
(CVE-2012-1947) Heap-use-after-free in
nsFrameList::FirstChild (CVE-2012-1940)
Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLReflowState::CalculateHypotheticalBox, with nested
multi-column, relative position, and absolute position
(CVE-2012-1941)

Hi,
I notice two security issues in the new Mozilla updater service which came with FF12 on Windows I would like to report.
a) The service path is not quoted which means you can end up with the potential for a planting attack (e.g. if you can create C:\Program.exe it will run it when starting the service).
b) The service itself can be tricked into loading a DLL into the process with SYSTEM privileges and it will run its DLLMain (meaning you can do anything you like). You call LoadLibrary instead of LoadLibraryEx on line 329 of workmonitor.cpp when checking that you have the correct resource string. It should be called to only load it as a resource.
The following C# code will run the service and will load a DLL as long as the files C:\sourcecode\exploitme.dll and C:\sourcecode\updater.exe are the same. The DLL can then in DllMain run something like CreateProcess.
using System;
using System.ServiceProcess;
namespace FFService
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
try
{
ServiceController c = new ServiceController("MozillaMaintenance");
c.Start(new string[] { "aaa", "software-update", "C:\\sourcecode\\exploitme.dll", "aaaa", "c:\\sourcecode\\", "cccc" });
}
catch (Exception e)
{
Console.WriteLine(e);
}
}
}
}
I have only tested in XP Pro SP3 but I assume it will work on Win7 and Vista just the same.
If you need more information let me know.

For a) no but the user would need write access into C:\ directly.
For b) yes we verify that the updater.exe is the same as the one in the installation directory before loading the library to make sure it is an actual updater.
So both attacks from what I understand require write access to elevated directories.

|  | |

So anyone running as admin (which is just about anyone on windows) would have rights to these directories I think. On vista and 7 they should get warnings when trying to write to some directories as that may require a UAC decision depending on the settings the user has.

|  | |

Agreed and I am fairly certain that anyone running as admin that is tricked into setting this up could as easily be tricked into just executing what this would accomplish with the same end result without jumping through as many hoops.

|  | |

so I think the main worry is that an admin could execute code as the system account. But any admin can already do this very easily by simply creating a new service that runs as the system account and then starting it.

I thought users were default admin on XP/Vista/7 if there were the first and/or only user of the system? So this is still a large segment of our user population. I do not mean to discount [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=748764#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service") but if users are default for admin rights we may be raising the stakes just a bit for attack surface no?

|  | |

Just a note that on Windows XP the code in question does not execute.
Also if UAC is off the code does not execute.
So I believe that writing to those locations would always have a UAC prompt for every case that the code executes.

You do not need to write to c: all paths are attacker supplied and thus controlled I can provider a proper poc tomorrow or compile that c# and change the paths and see where it tries to go using procmon etc

|  | |

Ya for b) I see now.
The apply to directory is an argument that is supplied. We do verify that this is a Firefox installation directory but that is in the signature check which happens after this LoadLibrary call. The user would have to pass a command line argument to the apply to directory that has a copy of the dll they want to load named updater.exe.

|  | |

That is correct. I also tested Uac admin on win7 with my poc and it works on there to. Of course even if you directly checked for updater.exe in program files you would still have a race condition where the attacker could change the user supplied file before loadlibrary.
I didn't look much further as I had other things but do you ensure that the file you signature check is the same file you exec? By for example copying to a secure location before verification? Or do you run the installed updater in the end? If not there might be a race there as well.

I think there is a potential for a race condition there, I added this patch to lock the file for write access before any of the checks happen.

Also worth pointing out that with a), while yes on a vanilla Windows box it should not be possible to write a file to either C:\ or C:\program files, few people have vanilla configurations. I have seen users, admins and OEMs break these security principles before now. You can only really be reasonably confident in the directories you yourself created, not anything else on the file system.
On a related note, if FF is installed to a non-standard directory does the updater service get installed to a secure directory elsewhere, or does it not get installed at all, or does it get installed along side?

If installed it will always be installed into program files. It will only be used if the user does not have write access into the apply to directory.

|  | |

That fix for the race is not quite correct, for at least two reasons.
1) The attacker need not provide a path to a file system which honors the write locking. For example if he pointed it to a UNC path then he could change it on the remote server and Windows \*could\* return the new data at LoadLibrary time.
2) The semantics of LoadLibrary differ from CreateFile when it comes to paths. For example there is no checking done to make the path absolute so if you provide a relative path then LoadLibrary "could" search the path first (an unlikely condition). But probably more importantly, if you supply a filename with no extension then LoadLibrary always appends .DLL to the filename before loading, CreateFile will open the name as is.

Is there a compiled PoC anywhere that can be used for this. How do use the code snippet in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=748764#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service") to see the bug isn't entirely clear to me since I need dlls to use from the C:\sourcecode directory (?), which are copied from somewhere? The updater?

You can just change the command line parameters to specify whichever directory you want. [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=748764#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service") shows a C# program that you would run to reproduce, you can create a Dll with code that runs in DllMain I believe to reproduce.

[Compiled PoC](attachment.cgi?id=620992)

Extract the PoC and run it on the command line with the mozilla service installed. updater.exe is just a renamed DLL.

Verified fixed in nightly trunk on XP SP3. Running with Firefox 12 and the compiled PoC, calc.exe is run when the PoC is invoked (and running as System). With the nightly, this no longer occurs.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

I'm not entirely convinced this is "critical" for today's Firefox users, because as a practical matter if you've got something running locally that can create c:\Program.exe you can probably trick that user into approving a UAC prompt and then do what you want. But fear of this kind of bug is exactly why we cautiously have chosen not to use the service for users with a limited account. Had this not been reported it would become critical when we enable that in the future; we might as well treat it as such now.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-45

## Mozilla Updater fails to update some Windows Registry entries

Announced
May 14, 2013
Reporter
Robert Kugler
Impact
High
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 21

### Description

Security researcher **Robert Kugler** discovered that in some
instances the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows will be vulnerable to some
previously fixed privilege escalation attacks that allowed for local privilege
escalation. This was caused by the Mozilla Updater not updating Windows Registry
entries for the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which fixed the earlier issues
present if Firefox 12 had been installed. New installations of Firefox after
version 12 are not affected by this issue. Local file system access is necessary
in order for this issue to be exploitable and it cannot be triggered through web
content.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-35

## Privilege escalation through Mozilla Updater and Windows Updater Service

Announced
June 5, 2012
Reporter
James Forshaw
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 13
* SeaMonkey 2.10
* Thunderbird 13

### Description

Security researcher **James Forshaw** of Context Information
Security found two issues with the Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater service introduced in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows Mozilla's updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context. The updater
can be called by the Updater Service or independently on systems that do not use
the service. The second of these issues allows for the updater service to load an arbitrary local DLL file, which can then be run with the same system privileges used by the service. Both of these issues require local file system access to be exploitable.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725
Steps to reproduce:
The updater.exe from FF12 loads the wsock32.dll from the application directory during initialization, this is an issue when combined with the maintenance service as it would allow an attacker to privilege escalate to local system without any prompts. As it is the real updater.exe doing the loading it circumvents all the protections in place to ensure it is signed etc.
I have attached a poc which I have tested on win7 64bit with FF12. You need to extract the zip, run the FFServer.exe file with the path to your installation of FF12 on the command line. It should then start the maintenance service (which should be enabled) and it will run updater.exe. This then loads the fake wsock32.dll from the current directory and a localsystem copy of calc should appear in the process list. Wsock32.dll is just a simple dll which runs calc in DllMain. All it needed was to export oridinal 14 to ensure the loader loaded it.
Actual results:
A fake wsock32.dll is loaded from the updater directory which loads into the local system privileged version of updater.exe. At this point it is possible to do anything you like with elevated permissions.
Expected results:
It shouldn't be loading from the current directory (not that it has much choice).

If it is updater.exe that loads the dll isn't this just as exploitable with updater.exe without the service? The user will get a UAC prompt that the signed Mozilla updater would like to run, they click yes to elevate because they trust mozilla, then it loads the dll.

Looks like the exports we're using it for is just for the ntohl calls in
toolkit\mozapps\update\updater\bspatch.cpp
I guess the same thing could be done for SHLWAPI.dll, CRYPT32.dll or shell32.dll?
How about ADVAPI32.dll, Kernel32.dll, user32.dll, gdi32.dll, comctl32.dll?

If that's true then I guess it would follow that basically any exe that requests elevated access via UAC, or is run elevated, from something other than NTFS with proper ACL's set is insecure.

Some DLLs are in the knowndlls list in the registry, I think only crypt32.dll (along with wsock32.dll) is not in the known list and would in theory be just as vulnerable. (see HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs).
And it would be an issue with UAC prompt, but I didn't necessarily consider that scenario to be as serious as silent privilege escalation.
I assume this is something which could not be exploited remotely. I haven't looked at how the files are downloaded, but I assume they are SSL protected or similar?
And yes to be fair it would apply to an awful lot of other applications, especially if not in a secure location. But with the maintenance service you are making a trust decision to run an application from an untrusted location, even if you trust the application itself.

Usually with this kind of stuff the risk is real if Firefox is installed in a network location, which is possible in some corporate/school environments.
I think this bug is real. For any DLLs that are not in the known DLLs list and we load in updater, we want to stop linking statically, and dynamically load them after calling SetDllDirectory("").

Also, the impact of this is "remote" code execution (that is, running code put on the network share) with system privileges, so I'm inclined to call this sg:crit.

Thanks for explaining about the knownDLLs list in the registry. I guess if they are in this list then they go direct to the Windows directory?
So I think the best fix here is just to use our own implementation of ntohl correct? It's strange to me that this dll is not in the known dlls list.
An alternate fix would be for us to add this dll to that list since I think it should already be there, but I think the first fix is better since I don't know what side effects doing this would have.

I agree by the way that the service case is worse because it can be done automated without user intervention. But the updater.exe only way is pretty bad as well since our only defense would be to say to the user that it's your fault for trusting us.

Yes the knowndlls indicate that those DLLs should always be loaded from the windows system directory. I think the original rationale was not security as such, more compatibility as they are critical DLLs to the running of the system and loading multiple different versions could be problematic (Dlls are scoped on path so you could end up with say two kernel32.dlls otherwise). I would probably say it isn't a good idea to start playing with the KnownDlls list though otherwise you risk compat problems for other applications.
One reason wsock32.dll is not in the list is it is a compat wrapper for ws2\_32.dll (which is in the list). If you look at the DLL itself it is actually just a forwarder for the real DLL. As I mentioned though fixing ntohl won't necessarily help, for a start I believe crypt32.dll would also be vulnerable as it isn't in the list. Also I believe that any runtime load would also run the risk of causing issues, and those might be initiated either explicitly by your code (don't think there are any though atm) or implcititly by performing some other action, e.g. using shell APIs which load COM. Even standard techniques to prevent binary planting won't necessarily be effective, such as calling SetDllDirectory() because all that does is neuter the PATH environment search not loading from the application directory.
I will freely admit I am not sure how to fix this in a simple way which covers all bases and won't run the risk of accidentally becoming unstuck due to either later changes in the updater code or installed software. I believe the official recommendation from MS is basically if you run an exe at elevated privileges it should only be from somewhere which is trusted, but lets face it I am sure most installers in existence break that very principle.

I would say we should just copy it to the maintenance service directory as you mentioned in the last bug, but this doesn't cover the case of [Comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=750850#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from application directory").

Perhaps the only way might be to only run the updater already installed in the FF directory (referenced probably from a secure location in the registry). I assume that in the service and UAC case this would prevent this issue (as you wouldn't be running the service or UAC if you were able to write to the installed directory). It would also avoid the race condition issues etc. and might actually simplify the service code as you wouldn't need to worry about it actually being signed in the first place, at least not the updater, you would still need to check update file itself.
In the service case I could imagine this wouldn't make a difference as you are already ensuring that the new updater you downloaded matches the one you have installed into program files. But for UAC case, it might block your upgrade path going forward. And I guess this is all things you guys have discussed previously.

Hmm, we're technically not supposed to modify the list of known DLLs, and doing that requires privileges in the first place anyways.
I think the correct way to fix this is what I said in the last paragraph of [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=750850#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from application directory"). No need to use our own implementation of ntohl or anything.

That sounds good to me - I see James' caveat about it not affecting DLL's loaded implicitly via COM etc but it should address loading from the current directory. James also makes another good point that the runtime loading code should be reviewed carefully - Thanks for the reports and the advice/discussion, James !

AFAIK, SetDllDirectory affects the search path for \*all\* DLLs. The only ones which will not be affected by it are the ones loaded before main(), specifically the statically linked DLLs...

| [Comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=750850#c15)• 13 years ago |

As far as I understand it all calling SetDllDirectory with an empty string does is affect the use of the current working directory. This is distinct from the application's directory and need not be the same. As the attacker would control the applications directory it matters little to where the current directory is pointed to.
This is based on [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686203(v=vs.85).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686203%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) the remarks indicate it just affects step two, where normally it would search the current directory. Step one is still the application's directory.

Oh, wait. Are we talking about the attacker controlling the current directory or the application's directory? SetDllDirectory("") fixes the former. In the latter case, we've already lost, and there is practically nothing that we can do about it.

I found a way to fix this, we have to delay load wsock32.dll and other DLLs not in the known DLL list. Then we have to simply load the library from an absolute file path at startup.
The delay load dll linker option makes it so the dll isn't loaded until the first symbol is used. So as long as we do the manual load at the start of main we're good. I confirmed already it fixes the PoC.

I tried SetDllDirectory earlier today btw ehsan but it didn't fix the problem. At least for implicitly loaded DLLs it will not fix it.

Ah yes, the bug report was in relation specifically to the updater's use in the new maintenance service for silent installation and its potential for a privilege escalation route. In this case the service will run the updater from the attacker's controlled directory leading to execution at SYSTEM from any user account. However I would say that calling SetDllDirectory("") would be a useful thing to add anyway for the general case to any application.
Of course some have argued that if someone is running code on your machine then you have lost anyway, but I don't hold that same view (otherwise why have privilege separation at all) and technically this doesn't strictly require an attacker to run code, only the ability to drop a file somewhere.
The delay loading is one option, my concern would be robustness of the fix as you would have to track which DLLs were in use for every build (I guess). If the compiler changed something at some point to load new DLLs or someone adds extra code and doesn't realise they need to update the list I would be concerned the fix could break.

The delay loading + explicit loading seems like a good approach - again James' point about this being a bit brittle is well taken. It seems unlikely to me there's some way to throw an error if a DLL isn't delay loaded at compile/link time but if there was, we should use that (much the same as we run binscope on every Windows build to make sure non-ASLR etc DLL's haven't been introduced)
James, i agree with your view and believe we certainly want to protect against privilege escalation to SYSTEM via this feature

I am sure there is probably something which will check for delay loads of the DLLs, or at least could be easily written. Of course that probably isn't the issue, the problem comes not if isn't delay loaded but it isn't pre-loaded by the code. And of course this still doesn't fix the potential for implicit loads via loading of DLLs which you don't directly link against, which could change depending on what software a user has installed (AV being a special problem with their habit of loading DLLs into all processes).

I'm having issues getting the PoC to work in Firefox 12, can someone help me?
Command from cmd.exe:
c:\Users\mozilla\Documents\poc>FFService.exe "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Fir
efox\firefox.exe"
Does not seem to do anything...

If you watch the task manager on Windows, you should see calc.exe start after running it, as I recall.

Yeah, no calc.exe is appearing in Task Manager, even showing processes from all users. Again, tested with Firefox 12 on Win7 64-bit running the command from cmd.exe:
FFService.exe "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"
Also tried the following with the same result:
FFService.exe "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\"

Oh wait, I see now. Running the following worked:
FFService.exe "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox"
I'll use this to test fixed builds now.
