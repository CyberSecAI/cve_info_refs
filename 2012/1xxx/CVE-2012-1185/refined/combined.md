How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE-2012-1185 / CVE-2012-1186 assignment notification - incomplete
 ImageMagick fixes for CVE-2012-0247 / CVE-2012-0248

Hi,

The original fixes for the ImageMagick issues CVE-2012-0247 and
CVE-2012-0248 are incomplete.

The original fix for CVE-2012-0247 failed to check for the possibility
of an integer overflow when computing the sum of "number_bytes" and
"offset". This resulted in a wrap around into a value smaller than
"length", making original CVE-2012-0247 introduced "length" check still
to be possible to bypass, leading to memory corruption.

We have assigned CVE-2012-1185 identifier for the incomplete fix of the
CVE-2012-0247 issue.

Relevant upstream patches:
[1]
<http://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/6998/ImageMagick/branches/ImageMagick-6.7.5/magick/profile.c>
[2]
<http://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/6998/ImageMagick/branches/ImageMagick-6.7.5/magick/property.c>

Red Hat Bugzilla bug:
[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-1185>

The original fix for CVE-2012-0248 failed to correct the denial of
service condition in "profile.c" source code part, too. This still
allowed the specially-crafted image file, when processed for example by
the "convert" executable, to cause original CVE-2012-0248 problem
(denial of service).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-19 10:50:33 UTC  ``` The original fix for [CVE-2012-0247](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0247) was found to be insufficient.  The original fix for [CVE-2012-0247](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0247) failed to check for the possibility of an integer overflow when computing the sum of "number_bytes" and "offset". This resulted in a wrap around into a value smaller than "length", making original [CVE-2012-0247](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0247) introduced "length" check still to be possible to bypass, leading to memory corruption.  Relevant upstream patches: [1] <http://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/6998/ImageMagick/branches/ImageMagick-6.7.5/magick/profile.c> [2] <http://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/6998/ImageMagick/branches/ImageMagick-6.7.5/magick/property.c>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c1)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-19 13:22:21 UTC  ``` A CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-1185](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1185) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c2)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-03-19 19:59:40 UTC  ``` Is upstream author informed?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c3)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-19 20:16:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c2)) > Is upstream author informed?  Yes, they've been informed about the issues and published fixes (e.g. see the patches linked in the description above - [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c0)).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c4)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-03-20 16:25:59 UTC  ``` I speak informed about fix is not sufficient.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-20 18:04:22 UTC  ``` Pavel,  Yes, we've informed ImageMagick upstream about the incorrect fix, so ImageMagick upstream knows about the incorrect fix. Upstream ImageMagick has completely fixed this in the ImageMagick subversion repository (3 weeks ago).  If you want to know a detailed list of the upstream ImageMagick releases including the complete fix, you should contact ImageMagick upstream.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c6)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-03-21 17:28:29 UTC  ``` Do you known ImageMagick version which is not affected? I think it have worth build at least for rawhide and may be Fedora 17 too.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c7)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-04-11 13:29:29 UTC  ``` Rawhide build which should fix it <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=3977291>.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=804588#c8)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-04-24 21:37:50 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of ImageMagick as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not backport the insufficient patch for [CVE-2012-0247](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0247).   ``` |  |
