  "CVE-2012-1185": {
    "Description": "The original fix for CVE-2012-0247 failed to check for the possibility of an integer overflow when computing the sum of \"number_bytes\" and \"offset\". This resulted in a wrap around into a value smaller than \"length\", making original CVE-2012-0247 introduced \"length\" check still to be possible to bypass, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when calculating the sum of 'number_bytes' and 'offset'.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Incomplete fix"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted image files",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a crafted image file to be processed by ImageMagick"
