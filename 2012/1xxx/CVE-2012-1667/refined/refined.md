{
  "cveId": "CVE-2012-1667",
  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the handling of zero-length rdata records in BIND. When processing DNS records, BIND does not handle zero-length rdata records correctly.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of zero-length rdata records"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending specially crafted DNS resource records, leading to a crash of the BIND name server, memory disclosure, or zone data corruption in certain configurations.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Network-based attacks via sending specially crafted DNS resource records."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft DNS packets with zero-length rdata records and send them to a vulnerable BIND server. This could involve owning or controlling a DNS domain and setting such records.",
      "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability primarily affects recursive resolvers but also can affect authoritative nameservers if they are configured to use experimental record types with no data. Secondary servers may crash after transferring a zone containing such records and the master server can corrupt zone data. The issue can cause the server to terminate unexpectedly."
