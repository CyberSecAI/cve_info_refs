    "CVE-2012-1169": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": "The vulnerability exists in Moodle before 2.2.2, where the user's full name is displayed in breadcrumbs even when the administrative setting for displaying names is set to 'first name only'.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user name display settings in breadcrumbs.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Personal information disclosure. The system fails to properly enforce the configured name display setting, leaking full names when only first names should be shown.\n- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can potentially gain access to users' full names, even if they are configured to display only first names, leading to a breach of user privacy and potentially enabling further social engineering attacks.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a network connection. An attacker only needs to browse the page which includes the breadcrumbs to see the full names, if the name format is set to display first name only.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities or position are required, any user with network access can potentially exploit this issue."
