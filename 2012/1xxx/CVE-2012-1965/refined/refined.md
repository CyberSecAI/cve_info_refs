Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2012-1965:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists because Mozilla allows the `feed:` pseudo-protocol to prefix any valid URL. This allows the construction of `feed:javascript:` URLs, which can execute scripts in certain contexts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper handling of `feed:javascript:` URLs.
*   Potential for bypassing output filtering that would normally strip `javascript:` URLs, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) issues.
*   The browser allows `feed:` to prefix any URL and the inner URL inherits the security context of the page, which is inappropriate for `javascript:` URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a website by using the vulnerable `feed:` URL, and cause the script to run. This could result in arbitrary code execution on affected sites by bypassing the typical protection against javascript URLs.

**Attack vectors:**

*   By crafting a malicious `feed:javascript:` URL, an attacker can bypass output filtering.
*   The attacker would need to get the user to interact with this malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious `feed:javascript:` URL.
*   The attacker needs to find a site that does not properly filter output and then entice a user to visit that site and trigger the crafted malicious URL.
*   No special position or capabilities are required beyond the ability to craft a URL and entice a user to visit it.

**Additional details:**

*   This vulnerability affects Firefox and Firefox ESR.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 14 and Firefox ESR 10.0.6.
*   The vulnerability could be exploited to evade output filtering, leading to XSS on sites.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via an iframe to inject code by creating a `feed:javascript:` URL.
