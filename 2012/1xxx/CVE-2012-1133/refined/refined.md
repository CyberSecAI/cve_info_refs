{
  "CVE-2012-1133": {
    "Description": "An out-of heap-based buffer write flaw was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine performed parsing of glyph information and bitmaps for certain glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF) fonts. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted BDF font file, which once opened in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that application crash, or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "Root cause": "Out-of heap-based buffer write when parsing BDF glyph information and bitmaps.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow/write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Application crash, potentially arbitrary code execution with user privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted BDF font file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to entice a user to open a specially crafted BDF font file"
  }
