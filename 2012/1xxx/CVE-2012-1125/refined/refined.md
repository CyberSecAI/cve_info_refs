Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the `uploadify.php` script within the Kish Guest Posting WordPress plugin. This script lacks proper validation of uploaded file extensions, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including those containing malicious PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `uploadify.php` script does not sufficiently check the file type of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload any file type.
*   **Inadequate File Extension Check:**  The plugin attempts a "fix" in version 1.2 by checking the file extension against an allowlist (`png`, `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`). However, it only checks the last three characters of the filename and is easily bypassed by using a filename with an allowed extension but containing malicious PHP code. This is not a proper file type check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the web server and the associated WordPress site.
*   **Website Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a compromised website, enabling attackers to deface the site, steal sensitive data, install backdoors, or use the server for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers can directly send a POST request to the vulnerable `uploadify.php` script, including a malicious file in the `Filedata` parameter and specifying the upload directory with the `folder` parameter. The file is uploaded without proper validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server where the vulnerable WordPress plugin is installed.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication, meaning any remote user can attempt the exploit.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests to craft the necessary POST request with the malicious file upload.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit requires specifying the target folder using the `folder` parameter.
*   The provided exploit code uses a PHP payload to execute shell commands via HTTP headers.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed after the vendor failed to respond to multiple notifications.
*   The "fix" implemented in version 1.2 is insufficient to prevent the exploit as it is easily bypassed.
