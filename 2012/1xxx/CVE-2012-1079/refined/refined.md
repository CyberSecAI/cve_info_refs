The provided content is a security advisory for multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions, and it is directly related to CVE-2012-1079.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**
The advisory lists multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions that have vulnerabilities, including:
*   **SQL Injection:** `mv_cooking`, `toi_category`, `mm_whtppr`, `rtg_files`, `bc_post2facebook`
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** `toi_category`, `rtg_files`, `bc_post2facebook`, `css_filelinks`, `irfaq`, `skt_eurocalc`, `ya_googlesearch`, `terminal`, `beuserswitch`, `jftcaforms`, `aeurltool`
*   **Information Disclosure:** `sysutils`, `beuserswitch`
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** `typo3_webservice`
*   **Open Redirection:** `irfaq`
*    **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** `terminal`

**Root Cause:**
The root causes of the vulnerabilities vary:
*   Improper input sanitization leading to SQL Injection.
*   Insufficient output encoding leading to XSS.
*   Lack of access controls leading to information disclosure.
*   Insecure handling of input leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   Improper handling of redirects leading to Open Redirection.
*   Missing CSRF tokens allowing for CSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes:
*   **Critical:** Full compromise of the database, allowing attackers to read/modify/delete data, potentially leading to complete control of the application.
*   **High:** Information disclosure, potential for modifying content on affected websites. Arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Medium:** Open redirection to malicious sites, XSS attacks to redirect users and steal data.
*   **Low:** Limited impact XSS, CSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**
Attack vectors include:
*   **Network:** Exploiting vulnerable parameters via HTTP requests to trigger SQL injection, XSS, arbitrary code execution.
*   **User Interaction:**  For XSS, malicious JavaScript can be injected through vulnerable fields and executed when other users view the page. For open redirection, users can be tricked into clicking malicious links. For CSRF, a user needs to be logged into the system to be vulnerable, and can be tricked into performing actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:**  Most vulnerabilities could be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers.
*   **Authenticated:** Certain vulnerabilities (like `typo3_webservice`) might require the attacker to be authenticated with specific privileges. Some XSS and CSRF attacks also require the target user to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory categorizes the vulnerabilities and provides suggested CVSS v2.0 scores for each vulnerability.
*   It indicates that the SQL Injection in `mv_cooking` is being exploited in the wild.
*   It specifies the affected versions for each extension.
*   It provides links to updated versions when available and also indicates that some extensions are removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository because the authors did not provide a fix in a timely manner.
*   The advisory advises following the TYPO3 security guide and subscribing to the typo3-announce mailing list.
