```
Root cause of vulnerability: The pcap and pcap-ng file parsers could crash trying to read ERF data.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption/crash due to malformed pcap/pcap-ng file formats when processing ERF data.
Impact of exploitation: Denial of Service (DoS). It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
Attack vectors: Malicious pcap/pcap-ng file.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to provide a malformed packet trace file to the victim.
