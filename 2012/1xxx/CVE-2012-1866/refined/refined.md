      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode drivers do not properly validate input passed from user mode.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists because of the way that Windows kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects.",

          "To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system.",
