Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability addressed in the provided content:

**CVE-2012-1205 is related to a security issue in the "Relocate Upload" WordPress plugin.**

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin used a direct GET request to handle AJAX actions, without utilizing the proper WordPress AJAX API, making it vulnerable to exploitation. The plugin directly included `wp-load.php` based on a parameter from the request.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin was using a non-standard method for handling AJAX requests, making it possible for attackers to bypass security checks. By making a direct GET request to the plugin's PHP file and including `wp-load.php` using a supplied path via the `abspath` parameter, bypassing WordPress's security mechanisms.
    *   **Missing Capability Checks:** The original code did not properly verify the user's permissions before allowing actions to move files.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized File Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate file paths using the GET parameter and gain control over file relocation.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** By directly loading `wp-load.php`, an attacker could potentially bypass WordPress security and execute arbitrary code.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct GET requests:** Attackers could exploit this by sending crafted GET requests to the plugin's PHP file. This is because it was directly processing parameters from the GET request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the `abspath` parameter value.
    *   The attacker does not need to be logged into the Wordpress backend, or have any specific capabilities, due to missing security checks.
    
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.20 of the plugin by adopting the proper 'wp_ajax_' action, which uses a safer method of handling AJAX requests and uses WordPress security measures.
