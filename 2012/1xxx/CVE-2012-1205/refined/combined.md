How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Description

Relocate Upload lets you specify folders, and adds a menu to the Media Library (and Edit Media admin page) that lets you switch media items between these folders and WPs default upload location.

### Known Issues

When creating new folders,

## Screenshots

* [![](https://ps.w.org/relocate-upload/trunk/screenshot-1.png?rev=2240877)](https://ps.w.org/relocate-upload/trunk/screenshot-1.png?rev=2240877)

  A simple menu switches media assets to your favourite locations. All through the magic of AJAX.
* [![](https://ps.w.org/relocate-upload/trunk/screenshot-2.png?rev=2240877)](https://ps.w.org/relocate-upload/trunk/screenshot-2.png?rev=2240877)

  A simple settings page to define the folder locations.

## Installation

1. Upload the whole ‘relocate-upload’ folder to the plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Specify your folders in the settings page.

## FAQ

Why? What’s the point of these other folders?

Most servers are set up so that assets can only be used when referred from your own site – to stop bandwidth leeching. However folders can be set aside that don’t obey this rule – e.g. for placing images on other sites, downloading mp3s from RSS feeds and so on.

you must change in plugin line 348:
return preg\_replace( '#(http://.\*?/)[.]\*?' . SERVER\_DOC\_ROOT . '#', $protocol . $host . '/' , $url );
in:
return preg\_replace( '#(https://.\*?/)[.]\*?' . SERVER\_DOC\_ROOT . '#', $protocol . $host . '/' , $url );
Because with http doesnt work.
Thank you! I like the plugin very much!

I was hesitant to use a plugin with so few active installs and not the greatest review rating, but this is exactly what I needed. It took me a little to figure out how it works. Just a note, sometimes when I first upload something it will appear to be in the folder I want, but it is actually in the default location. I have found that I just need to move it to the default location (it will fail, because that is where it already is) and them move it to the correct folder and it will be in the right spot. Give yourself time to experiment and play with this plugin and you will find out that it works!

The plugin used to work but currently breaks the URL to the image. Needs to be fixed.

But mostly throws PHP notices and breaks the URLs to images.
