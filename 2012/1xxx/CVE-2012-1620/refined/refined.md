      "content": "This document provides details of a bug report regarding slock version 0.9, where a modal dialog box created after slock is activated becomes visible when keys are pressed while the screen is locked. The vulnerability occurs because the slock screen locker utility does not properly handle the XRaiseWindow event when the screen is locked. This allows a physically proximate attacker to obtain sensitive information by pressing a key, which reveals the desktop and any open windows. \n\nSteps to reproduce: 1. Run sleep <n>; <X-program>, where <X-program> is an application that opens a window. 2. Lock the screen with slock as fast as you can. 3. Ensure <n> seconds have passed, so that the <X-program> has started. 4. Press some keys (any keys) to show the locked screen and active application.\n\nThe vulnerability is rated as minor, not critical, because it does not allow interaction with the application. The issue was resolved in slock version 1.0 which prevents the window from flashing up and is addressed in GLSA 201412-10.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of the XRaiseWindow event by slock when the screen is locked. \n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Display of content that was supposed to be hidden by the screen locker. \n\nImpact of exploitation: Potential exposure of sensitive information visible on the unlocked desktop. \n\nAttack vectors: Physical access to the machine while a screen lock is active, combined with a program starting after the lock is active. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: Must be physically present at the machine and able to press keys."

It includes details on the vulnerability reported in the gentoo bug report, and references the openwall mailing list for the CVE assignment. The bug is marked as CLOSED ERRATA. \n\nThe vulnerability is summarized as a modal box being displayed after locking in slock version 0.9, exposing the desktop when pressing a key. It is noted that this issue does not occur with slock-0.9-9.fc16.x86_64 or slock-0.9-10r.fc16.x86_64. The fix for this vulnerability was included in slock-0.9-10.fc16 and resolved on January 31.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of the XRaiseWindow event when the screen is locked. \n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Exposure of window content when the screen is expected to be locked. \n\nImpact of exploitation: Disclosure of potentially sensitive information visible on the unlocked desktop. \n\nAttack vectors: Physical access to the machine with slock screen lock enabled and a concurrently running application which creates a window after the lock is initiated. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: Physical access to the machine, ability to press any key."
