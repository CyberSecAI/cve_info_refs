      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "A race condition exists when unregistering events attached to the same eventfd in the memory control group (memcg) subsystem of the Linux kernel. When multiple events are registered to the same eventfd, the first unregistration removes all events and nullifies the 'thresholds->primary'. Subsequent unregistrations trigger a null pointer dereference because the code doesn't expect 'thresholds->primary' to be NULL.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Race condition in the memcg event unregistration process.",
        "Lack of proper null pointer checks in the mem\_cgroup\_usage\_unregister\_event() function."
      ],
      "Impact": "A local attacker can cause a kernel panic (oops) and potentially crash the system by registering and unregistering threshold events. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Local access is required to register threshold events on the system.",
          "Exploitation involves triggering a race condition by registering multiple events to the same eventfd and then unregistering them, leading to a kernel panic."
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
        "Local access to the system.",
        "Ability to register and unregister threshold events.",
           "No special privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability, meaning a normal user can cause the DoS"
      ],
        "Additional Information": "The vulnerability resides in the `mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event` function of the Linux kernel's memory control group (memcg) subsystem.  Specifically, after removing all events associated with a given eventfd, the code does not handle cases where `thresholds->primary` might be null. Subsequent attempts to unregister from the same eventfd trigger a null pointer dereference."
