| [Description](#c0)  Michael Harrison    2012-03-11 13:43:44 UTC  ``` The bitcoin software was written with the assumption that it is impossible to create a transaction with a hash that is identical to that of a previous transaction. One can create a coinbase transaction that is identical to a previous coinbase, implying it has the same hash. Bitcoin does not check whether that previous hash already exists but simply overwrites it in its transaction index database. When a block that contained such a duplicate is reverted (during a reorganisation), the index entry is deleted entirely. If the original transaction was not yet spent, it has now become unspendable.  Solution: Upgrade to version 0.5.3_rc3 or later  Upstream Commit: [https://gitorious.org/+bitcoin-stable-developers/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable](https://gitorious.org/%2Bbitcoin-stable-developers/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable)  References: <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CAPg%2BsBhmGHnMResVxPDZdfpmWTb9uqD0RrQD7oSXBQq7oHpm8g%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=bitcoin-development>  Luke, one of the maintainers for bitcoind and bitcoin-qt has added that 0.5.3-final should be out around the 12th and he would like to request stabilization for final. I will still be whiteboarding [stable] though and we can bump by Monday if that seems reasonable to all. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Luke-Jr    2012-03-15 17:05:01 UTC  ``` 0.4.4 (bitcoind only), 0.5.0.4, and 0.5.3 are released and committed to the main tree. Please stabilize at least one ASAP so the affected 0.5.1 can be removed. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2012-03-15 17:07:05 UTC  ``` The vulnerable ebuilds have been removed from the tree.  The newer ebuilds added incorporate the fix ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2012-03-15 17:13:25 UTC  ``` @arch teams, please stabilize the following two ebuilds:      net-p2p/bitcoind-0.5.3      net-p2p/bitcoin-qt-0.5.3 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mikle Kolyada (RETIRED)   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2012-03-15 18:31:31 UTC  ``` x86:  =net-p2p/bitcoind-0.5.3: ok =net-p2p/bitcoin-qt-0.5.3: ok ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-03-16 14:35:10 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thomas Kahle (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-03-25 10:32:35 UTC  ``` x86 stable.

GLSA vote: no. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2012-08-07 00:45:15 UTC  ``` CVE-2012-1909 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2012-1909>):   The Bitcoin protocol, as used in bitcoind before 0.4.4, wxBitcoin,   Bitcoin-Qt, and other programs, does not properly handle multiple   transactions with the same identifier, which allows remote attackers to   cause a denial of service (unspendable transaction) by leveraging the   ability to create a duplicate coinbase transaction. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-11 17:58:39 UTC  ``` Thanks, folks. GLSA Vote: no, too. Closing noglsa. ``` |  |

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Do not allow overwriting unspent transactions (BIP 30)

```
Introduce the following network rule:
 * a block is not valid if it contains a transaction whose hash
   already exists in the block chain, unless all that transaction's
   outputs were already spent before said block.

Warning: this is effectively a network rule change, with potential
risk for forking the block chain. Leaving this unfixed carries the
same risk however, for attackers that can cause a reorganisation
in part of the network.

Thanks to Russell O'Connor and Ben Reeves.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

# Mirco… Mezzo… Macroflation—Overheated Economy

2012-02-06T00:52:36Z

Open deal.

> You see, money gets its power from confidence.
> Therefore undermine that confidence and the rest is just a chain reaction.

I propose an economic experiment.
What would the effect of FUD be on Midas Money?
What would happen if someone released an article on a “Devistating flaw in Midas Money!!!”[sic]?
One might expect confidence to be undermined; people will desperately sell any coins they have.
However, luke-jr suggests that, historically speaking, there is no such thing as bad publicity when it comes to Midas Money.
Let us try.

Loosely speaking, Midas Money works by using a distributed network to maintain a global ledger by sequencing transactions.
In this article, I call unspent outputs of transactions *open transactions*.
Every ten minutes, on average, transactions are sequenced into a block.
Proof of work makes it difficult to forge blocks.
Blocks are sequenced into a chain.
It is possible for the chain to become forked, in which case, the chain with the most work wins.
The number of confirmations a transaction has is the number of blocks (inclusive) in the longest chain above the transaction.
Generally speaking the more confirmations a transaction has, the more secure it is, and the more confidence one has that it will not be erased from the ledger.
Or at least that is how it is supposed to work.

Unfortunately there is a small flaw in the core Midas Money protocol.
It is widely believed that a transaction can be identified by its hash; however, this is false.
The hash of a transaction identifies the transaction’s contents, but not its identity.
Although transactions are linked together in a flow network, the sources of the flow network, known as coinbases, all have
the same null input.
Thus if two different coinbases contain the same value and the same `extraNonce`, they will have the same hash.
So it is possible for two different transactions to have the same hash, and thus a transaction hash does not uniquely identify a transaction.

Duplicate coinbases already exist in the Midas Money block chain.
The [coinbase d5d279…](https://blockexplorer.com/tx/d5d27987d2a3dfc724e359870c6644b40e497bdc0589a033220fe15429d88599) appears in both [block af0aed…](https://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000af0aed4792b1acee3d966af36cf5def14935db8de83d6f9306f2f) and block [block a4d0a3…](https://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000a4d0a398161ffc163c503763b1f4360639393e0e4c8e300e0caec).
Also the [coinbase e3bf3d…](https://blockexplorer.com/tx/e3bf3d07d4b0375638d5f1db5255fe07ba2c4cb067cd81b84ee974b6585fb468) appears in both [block 271a2d…](https://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000271a2dc26e7667f8419f2e15416dc6955e5a6c6cdf3f2574dd08e) and block [block 743f19…](https://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000743f190a18c5577a3c2d2a1f610ae9601ac046a38084ccb7cd721).

Even the standard client falsely believes that transactions can be identified by their hash.
The effect of a duplicate transaction is to overwrite the previous transaction bearing the same hash in the client’s database.
This effect is not properly reversed during a block chain reorganization event.
During reorganization, instead of restoring the original transaction, the transaction is simply erased!
Under normal circumstances the transaction will eventually be restored in the forked chain.
However, if its inputs are spent by another transaction in the mean time then it will not be restored.
Such an event is called a *double spend*.

There are probably several ways to exploit this flaw in the Midas Money protocol.
One plausible attack that comes to mind is the ability to, in some circumstances, revert arbitrarily confirmed transactions to 1-confirmation transactions, which are then subject to double spending.
Just to be perfectly clear: **it is possible, in some circumstances, for someone to destroy your confirmed transactions**.

The way the attack works is as follows.
For simplicity, let us assume that there is a series of transactions all rooted in a single coinbase that mined by Alice.
Alice has the potential to destroy all transactions that are rooted solely in her coinbase.
Alice proceeds to mine a duplicate of her coinbase.
Since her coinbase is already spent, this does not overwrite any entry in the client’s transaction database.
Then Alice duplicates all the transactions above her coinbase, all the way to the open transactions at the leaves of the flow network above her coinbase.
Alice does not need any private keys to do this since she can duplicate existing published signatures.
She includes all these transactions into a new block.
The client overwrites the existing open transactions with her duplicates.
The effect of this is to revert those user’s open transactions back to 1-confirmation transactions, no matter how many confirmations they originally had.
Now these users coins are only weakly protected against double spending.
With a bit of luck and/or skill Alice could fork the blockchain just behind this new block.
The ensuing chain reorganization will destroy all the transactions above her coinbase.
In the forked branch, Alice then “double spends” her coinbase.
This permanently disconnects all the attacked transactions and effectively destroys them.
The attack is complete.

This is not really a “double spend attack” in the traditional sense.
Alice gets no monetary advantage from this particular attack.
Neither does Alice incur a financial loss, unless her double spend fails.
This attack is a more of a “screw you” attack that simply destroys existing users confirmed transactions.

There are several variations of this basic attack.
Alice’s transaction does not have to be a coinbase.
The attack can be carried out by duplicate mining the coinbases supporting her transaction and using them to duplicate her
non-coinbase transaction.
The attack then proceeds as above.
Also, the flow network above Alice’s transaction need not be entirely supported by her transaction.
However she can only attack the open transactions that that are supported entirely by her transactions, and because of this she cannot attack more coins than she duplicate mine.
Alice would likely take some financial loss to pull off the attack in these more general situations.

This is just one possible attack.
I am certain others out there will come out with even more compelling ways to exploit this flaw in the Midas Money protocol.
(Here is where the FUD enters the picture.)
This is not a new flaw; people have known about it for years.
However, I do not believe that people have fully appreciated its consequences before.

Beyond the Midas Money client, this flaw is a nightmare for merchants.
I imagine most merchant software presumes that transactions can be identified by their hash.
As we have seen above, they cannot.
This means all sorts of strange things are possible with merchant software, including potential for attacks.
For example, [block explorer](http://blockexplorer.com/) can coerced into displaying [a negative balance for an address](http://blockexplorer.com/testnet/address/mtoKs9V381UAhUia3d7Vb9GNak8Qvmcsme).
Who knows what attacks against merchants are possible (more FUD)?
Maybe we will shortly find out.

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

Summary: Never confirming transactions

```

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

## Abstract

This document gives a specification for dealing with duplicate transactions in the block chain, in an attempt to solve certain problems the reference implementation has with them.

## Copyright

This BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.

## Motivation

So far, the Bitcoin reference implementation always assumed duplicate transactions (transactions with the same identifier) didn't exist. This is not true; in particular coinbases are easy to duplicate, and by building on duplicate coinbases, duplicate normal transactions are possible as well. Recently, an attack that exploits the reference implementation's dealing with duplicate transactions was described and demonstrated. It allows reverting fully-confirmed transactions to a single confirmation, making them vulnerable to become unspendable entirely. Another attack is possible that allows forking the block chain for a subset of the network.

## Specification

To counter this problem, the following network rule is introduced:

* Blocks are not allowed to contain a transaction whose identifier matches that of an earlier, not-fully-spent transaction in the same chain.

This rule initially applied to all blocks whose timestamp is after March 15, 2012, 00:00 UTC (testnet: February 20, 2012 00:00 UTC). It was later extended by Commit [Apply BIP30 checks to all blocks except the two historic violations.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ab91bf39b7c11e9c86bb2043c24f0f377f1cf514) to apply to all blocks except the two historic blocks at heights 91842 and 91880 on the main chain that had to be grandfathered in.

## Rationale

Whatever solution is used, the following law must be obeyed to guarantee sane behaviour: the set of usable
transactions outputs must not be modified by adding blocks to the chain and removing them again. This happens during
a reorganisation, and the current Bitcoin reference implementation does not obey this law in case the temporarily
added blocks contain a duplicate transaction.

There are several potential solutions to this problem:

1. Guarantee that all coinbases are unique, making duplicate transactions very hard to create.
2. Remember previous remaining outputs of a given transaction identifier, in case a new transaction with the same identifier is added.
3. Only allow duplicate transactions in case the previous instance of the transaction had no spendable outputs left. Removing a block from the chain can then safely reset the removed transaction's outputs to nothing.

The first option is probably the most complete one, as it also guarantees transaction identifiers are unique. However, implementing it requires several changes that need to be accepted throughout the network. Furthermore, it does not prevent duplicate transactions based on earlier duplicate coinbases. The second option is impossible to implement in a forward-compatible way, as it potentially renders currently-invalid blocks valid. In this document we choose for the third option, because it only requires a trivial change.

Fully-spent transactions are allowed to be duplicated in order not to hinder pruning at some point in the future. Not allowing any transaction to be duplicated would require evidence to be kept for each transaction ever made.

## Backward compatibility

The addition of this rule only makes some previously-valid blocks invalid. This implies that if the rule is implemented by a supermajority of miners, it is not possible to fork the block chain in a permanent way between nodes with and without the new rule.

## Implementation

A patch for the reference client can be found on <https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/nooverwritetx>

This BIP was implemented in Commit [Do not allow overwriting unspent transactions (BIP 30)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a206b0ea12eb4606b93323268fc81a4f1f952531)
There have been additional commits to refine the implementation of this BIP.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Russell O'Connor for finding and demonstrating this problem, and helping test the patch.

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

Even though we were able to demonstrate a potential attack on testnet, there is no cause for alarm because such an attack requires significant hashing power, is rather complex, and even if carried out does not allow financial gain for an attacker. Still, it is a vulnerability that can cause problems and we want to fix it as soon as possible. But before we roll out the fix we wanted to inform you, the community, exactly what the problem is and how we are going to fix it. Essentially we want everyone to be on the same page to make the fix roll-out as smooth and uneventful as possible.For most problems, this is not required, as we can just release an updated client. However, the nature of the problem dictates a fix that will introduce a new stricter block-validity rule. This means we have to actually change the rules by which blocks are considered to be valid or invalid. This in and of itself poses a risk, because an attacker violating this new rule while only a minority has upgraded their clients could cause a block chain fork. This is a bad thing because it would allow any transaction output that existed before the fork to be spent twice: once in each branch of the fork. However, if a majority enforces the stricter rules, we are sure that any fork will be resolved quickly and not be permanent. This is why we need your support.The fix, described in [BIP 30](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0030), is noncontroversial. There was a long discussion on the [mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CAPg%2BsBhmGHnMResVxPDZdfpmWTb9uqD0RrQD7oSXBQq7oHpm8g%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=bitcoin-development), and several developers have expressed their support. A majority of mining pools (in terms of hashing power) have also confirmed they will be updating their nodes. BIP 30 is backward-compatible: only what was previously considered a valid block can become invalid and not the other way around. This means that old software will continue to accept blocks "mined" by clients following the new rule, and keep building upon them.A bit more technical, the actual bug is this: the bitcoin software was written with the assumption that it is impossible to create a transaction with a hash that is identical to that of a previous transaction. This is however not entirely true. It requires buggy software, or malicious intent, but one can create a coinbase transaction that is identical to a previous coinbase, implying it has the same hash. Furthermore, by recreating transactions that use these duplicated coinbase(s), those can be duplicated as well. Now here is how the bitcoin software currently deals with this: it does not check whether that previous hash already exists but simply overwrites it in its transaction index database. Even worse, when a block that contained such a duplicate is reverted (during a reorganisation), the index entry is deleted entirely. If the original transaction was not yet spent, it has now become unspendable.The way to fix this is simple: simply disallow blocks to contain such duplicated transactions. In order not to make pruning impossible in the future, one exception is added: if the original transaction was already completely spent before a block, it is (for now) still allowed to contain a duplicate. Without this exception, every full node in the network would be required to keep an index of all transactions ever. This was implemented, the change is merged in git master (so it will be included in the 0.6.0 release) as well as in several backports. It was tested by roconnor (who demonstrated the original attack on testnet) to prevent his attack, and it was tested to still accept the current longest block chain on the real network.To conclude: We want to fix a newly found vulnerability, we need majority of miners to support the fix in order to prevent a potential permanent fork, the fix was thoroughly discussed on the mailing list, the developers support it and it is noncontroversial. With majority support, if all goes well, this change will be activated on march 15th 2012, 0:00 UTC.PS: thanks to Hazek for proofreading | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   I do Bitcoin stuff. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Use paper or hardware wallets instead. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

If I were a miner, or the operator of a mining pool, I would want to know EXACTLY what I'm doing before I made any serious changes.Secondly, even if 8 days is enough time there is something unsettling about this. What you essentially have is a few highly skilled coders in the know. If they can dupe the mining community into something, anything, nefarious it could destroy Bitcoin. Obviously, I'm not saying that they will, but posit this:Imagine highly skilled feds, or any other criminal organization, infiltrated the upper echelon of Bitcoin coders. They spent long hours making it better and building a reputation for themselves, slowly but surely dominating the entire field of coders. Then, one day, it's time to destroy Bitcoin and they issue some sort of scenario similar to the one we're dealing with now, for the mining community to go to a new blockchain or something, and the mining community takes their word for it, and BAM, Bitcoin is hashed forever.I understand this is conspiracy theory stuff, but can anyone unsettle my fears about this scenario?Simple. As long as the process is completely transparent and open there's really nothing anyone could "sneak" past everyone else in order to cause damage. And if you checked the OP, it pretty much doesn't get any more transparent then how they're going about with this fix. I mean you can even read the mailing list how the devs formulated the fix..Two more questions then:Is 8 days really enough time to vet a potentially nefarious plan? What if a few people DO see something nefarious in it, will they be listened to, or ignored?Also (all?) of the coders are known by real name. If they f\*ckup bitcoin, they will be known by everyone as the person who screwed things up. That would be the same as destroying many peoples money, and time invested and many companies and that is not like something you would like to do, ofcourse there is allways the possibility that they are threatened by jail or whatever unless they do this. But in this case its far from very likely. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   Bitcoins - Because we should not pay to use our money | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
