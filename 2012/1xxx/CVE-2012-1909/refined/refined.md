  "CVE-2012-1909": {
    "Description": "The bitcoin software was written with the assumption that it is impossible to create a transaction with a hash that is identical to that of a previous transaction. One can create a coinbase transaction that is identical to a previous coinbase, implying it has the same hash. Bitcoin does not check whether that previous hash already exists but simply overwrites it in its transaction index database. When a block that contained such a duplicate is reverted (during a reorganisation), the index entry is deleted entirely. If the original transaction was not yet spent, it has now become unspendable.",
    "Root cause": "The Bitcoin software incorrectly assumes transaction hashes are unique and overwrites existing transactions in the index database without proper validation, leading to unspendable funds after a block reorganization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect assumption of transaction hash uniqueness",
       "Lack of validation for duplicate transaction hashes",
      "Improper handling of transaction index during block reorganization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (unspendable transaction). An attacker can create a duplicate coinbase transaction, which can overwrite an existing transaction in the index, making the original transaction unspendable after a block reorganization. Confirmed transactions can be reverted to 1 confirmation, making them susceptible to double spending.",
    "Attack vectors": [
     "Creating duplicate coinbase transactions",
     "Reorganization of the blockchain"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create a transaction with a hash that is identical to a previous transaction. This can be done by creating a duplicate coinbase transaction with the same value and extraNonce. The attacker also needs to be capable of reorganizing the blockchain to trigger the vulnerability."
