Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1262

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `mt-wizard.cgi` script of Movable Type.
- The specific vulnerability occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
   - Session hijacking
   - Stealing cookies
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Defacing the website
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `mt-wizard.cgi` page, which is used during the initial setup of Movable Type, before the application is fully installed.
- Specifically, the `dbuser` parameter in the POST request is vulnerable.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `dbuser` parameter which will then be rendered by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, as the `mt-wizard.cgi` is accessible prior to full installation.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request to the `mt-wizard.cgi` page with a payload in the `dbuser` parameter.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Movable Type installation.
- No specific user interaction is required, other than a user visiting the page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Movable Type versions prior to 5.13, 5.07, and 4.38.
- This vulnerability was reported by Trustwave (TWSL2012-003).
- Patches for this issue were included in the Movable Type 5.13, 5.07, and 4.38 releases.
- This vulnerability is distinct from the other vulnerabilities mentioned in the advisories, like the OS command injection, session hijacking and CSRF vulnerabilities, although they were patched in the same release.
