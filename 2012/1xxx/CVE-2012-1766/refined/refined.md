  "CVE-2012-1766": {
    "Description": "Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the Oracle Outside In libraries, specifically when parsing malformed files. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable application.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of malformed files by Oracle Outside In libraries during parsing.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Depending on the application using Outside In, this could lead to complete system compromise.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Specially crafted file",
        "File upload"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to a system that uses vulnerable versions of Oracle Outside In libraries. This can happen through various channels, for example, by sending a specially crafted email attachment in Exchange, or uploading a file to a Sharepoint server. No authentication is required in some cases."
