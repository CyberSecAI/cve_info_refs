How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
The user's global access level must be >= $g_manage_site_threshold to
be allowed to add, edit or delete global categories.

Prior to this, once a user had been defined as Manager on at least one
project, they could freely update global categories.

Also prevents such updates through URL manipulation.

Fixes #13561

Please use CVE-2012-1118 for this issue

> CVE REQUEST #2: MantisBT < 1.2.9 copy/clone bug report action
> failed to leave an audit trail
> <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13816>
>
> The copy/clone bug feature could be misused by authorised users to
> spam an issue tracker with multiple copies of bugs with no obvious
> audit trail of who was responsible. This is an annoyance on par
> with new users signing up to a bug tracker and generating bugnote
> (or other) spam. There is only so much we can do to solve the
> problem -- it is mostly up to the administrator of each MantisBT
> installation to screen new users.

Please use CVE-2012-1119 for this issue

> CVE REQUEST #3: MantisBT < 1.2.9
> delete_bug_threshold/bugnote_allow_user_edit_delete access check
> bypass via SOAP API <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13656>
>
> Users with write access to the SOAP API (this is a separate access
> check) were able to delete issues and bugnotes regardless of the
> configured $g_delete_bug_threshold and
> $g_bugnote_allow_user_edit_delete settings. As users need to be
> authorised and have read/write access via SOAP, they're likely
> already trusted. Additionally, SOAP is a feature that is rarely
> used on Internet facing bug trackers. For these reasons the impact
> of this bug is significantly reduced.

Please use CVE-2012-1120 for this issue

> CVE REQUEST #4: MantisBT < 1.2.9 managers of specific projects
> could update global category settings
> <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13561>
>
> If a user was given 'manager' permissions over a single project,
> they were also incorrectly allowed to modify and delete global bug
> categories. Consequences of this bug are limited because 'manager'
> permissions are usually reserved for trusted users and aren't
> handed out lightly.

Please use CVE-2012-1121 for this issue

> CVE REQUEST #5: MantisBT < 1.2.9 incorrect access checks performed
> when moving bugs between projects
> <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13748>
>
> When a user attempted to move a bug between projects, an invalid
> access check was performed. The $g_report_bug_threshold access
> level from the source project was used instead of the
> $g_report_bug_threshold access level from the destination project.
> The result of this bug is that users could move bugs into projects
> that they did not have access to report bugs within.

Please use CVE-2012-1122 for this issue

> CVE REQUEST #6: MantisBT < 1.2.9 SOAP API null password
> authentication bypass
> <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13901>
>
> This serious issue allowed an an attacker to bypass SOAP API
> authentication and login as any user without needing to provide a
> valid password. A SOAP client sending a null password field could
> assume the identity of a MantisBT administrator without needing a
> password and gain full access to the SOAP API (and consequently the
> entire MantisBT installation).
>
> [NOTE: the above summary for request #4 is based on reports made to
> the mantisbt-dev mailing list on the 16th of February 2012 - I have
> not independently confirmed the validity of this report. It may be
> worth waiting for independent confirmation of this report via
> mantisbt-dev. If this issue is valid, it has already been fixed in
> MantisBT 1.2.9 "just in case" by disallowing null and blank
> password logins via SOAP API.]
