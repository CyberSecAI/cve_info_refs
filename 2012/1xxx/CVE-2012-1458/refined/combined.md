No doubt most Symposium attendees believe they are conducting research in a scientific fashion already. The panelists will attempt to address these questions and to illuminate by example some methods that can accelerate progress and develop stronger foundations for a body of knowledge in cybersecurity. Substantial interaction between the audience the panelists is sought.  Participants who wish to prepare for this discussion on Science of Security on Wednesday afternoon should take a look at the Wikipedia entry on "Strong Inference": <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_inference>  In particular, if you have time, skim Platt's paper.  5:00 **Conference Ends** | [Find ieeesp2012 on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ieeesp2012)  [Follow IEEE_SP2012 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ieeessp)  --- | | --- | --- | |  | |   [Find ieeesp2012 on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ieeesp2012) [Follow IEEE_SP2012 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ieeessp)  Found an error?
