Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-1259:

**CVE-2012-1259**

*   **Root Cause:** The Scrutinizer web console fails to properly validate user input, passing it directly to the backend database, which results in SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks, where malicious SQL code can be injected through user-supplied parameters.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system lacks proper input validation and sanitization of user input before using it in database queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored within the database.
    *   **System Compromise:** It may be possible to perform other attacks on the system via the SQL injection vector.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** Some injection points are "blind", meaning the attacker may not see direct output, but can infer results by observing server behavior or timing.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET requests:** Vulnerable parameters are passed through HTTP GET requests.
    *   **Unauthenticated Exploitation:** These SQL injection vulnerabilities are exploitable without prior authentication.
    *   **Specific Parameters:** Vulnerable parameters include 'addip' within the `scrut_fa_exclusions.cgi` script and `getPermissionsAndPreferences` within the `login.cgi` script.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing prior access or credentials to the application.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
