Subject: CVE's for Drupal Contrib 2012 001 through 057 (67 new CVE assignments)

"CVE-2012-1658","SA-CONTRIB-2012-033","Read More Link - Cross Site
Scripting","<https://drupal.org/node/1471822>"
```

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1658
*   **Vulnerable Component:** Drupal "Read More Link" module
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The "Read More Link" module does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating "read more" links, leading to XSS vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A malicious user can inject malicious JavaScript code through the "read more" link, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they visit the page containing the link.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify "read more" links, usually through the Drupal content management interface, or potentially through other input mechanisms provided by the module, depending on the exact vulnerability.
