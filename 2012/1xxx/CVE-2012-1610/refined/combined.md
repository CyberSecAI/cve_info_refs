Hi,

the original patch for CVE-2012-0259 turned out to be insufficient.

The problem is an integer overflow error in the "GetEXIFProperty()"
function (magick/property.c, around line 1288):

      number_bytes=(size_t) components*tag_bytes[format];

When processing EXIF directory entries with tags of e.g. format 5
(EXIF_FMT_URATIONAL) and a large components count, the calculation can
overflow and e.g. lead to "number_bytes" being 0. If that's the case,
subsequent checks can be bypassed, resulting in the loop in the
"EXIFMultipleFractions" macro to iterate through a large number of
"components". This leads to out-of-bound reads until eventually causing
a segmentation fault when trying to read beyond the limits of heap memory.

An updated patch is available via the ImageMagick forum [1].

CVE-2012-1610 has been assigned to this issue.

Note: The initial patch for this issue is still necessary to prevent
access of uninitialized/incorrect memory when e.g. processing specially
crafted EXIF tags with a component count of 0.

Concerning ImageMagick 6.7.6-2 and earlier:

* [CVE-2012-0259] JPEG EXIF tag crash.
* [CVE-2012-0260] Excessive memory use with JPEG restart markers.
* [CVE-2012-1798] Copying of invalid memory when reading TIFF EXIF IFD.

Thanks goes to Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto and Tuomas Parttimaa of the Codenomicon CROSS project for discovering the vulnerabilities and providing a test case file. And thanks to the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority (CERT-FI) for alerting us to these vulnerabilities

These patches are included in the ImageMagick 6.7.6-3 release. For earlier releases, here are the patches to repair these vulnerabilities:

Hi

What are the dangers of not implementing this patch?

It is only dangerous if the images ImageMagick processes come from some unknown source, such as a typical user on the web.

The above basically basically says they crash the system. When means some limit check or input verification failed, somewhere.

However if some 'cracker' does a lot of work (much of it guess work) and know the exact version of IM you are using, they 'may' be able to use that failure to get IM to execute some other, user provided code. Code that could for example run a program to open a command line into the web server computer IM is running on.

Note that is it unlikely someone would spend that much effort for access to just one computer. It would be 'pay'. Such effort is more likely in a more common system, such as a well know web server, wiki (Apache), forum application (like this one), OS (AKA microsoft windows), and so on. So if you app become popular, THEN you may have a problem.

It is always better however to know about a potential problem, such as what is being reported by these security teams, and have it fixed, than leave it. Program bugs like these are easy to lose, even by the program who has intimate knowledge of the code working, and thus what is causing the problem. In fact there is a 'logic' proof that basically says that it is impossible to prove a program is bug free. As such all that we can do is make any actual bug as rare as we can.

Anthony: It's not that unlikely that a cyber warrior would be focused on a particular target.

Or that a "cracker" attempting to escalate his or her priviledges on a particular

machine.

Tama: If you are talking about your own computer, don't have any untrusted users on

it[1], and you aren't processing images from untrusted sources, then there is little danger,

but I'd try to fix any known vulnerabilities right away anyhow.

[1] You can't be sure you don't have untrusted users if your system is connected to

the net; they might have cracked your system and opened a back door!

Does it cause segmentation faults as well?

I believe this is what is happening to me. Need to upgrade...

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-29 10:02:49 UTC  ``` An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way ImageMagick, an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System, retrieved Exchangeable image file format (Exif) header tag information from certain JPEG files. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image file, with EXIF header containing specially-crafted tag values, which once opened in some ImageMagick tool would lead to the crash of that tool (denial of service).

Upstream was notified and a new patch was published on [1]. As announced in [2], [CVE-2012-1610](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1610) has been assigned to the insufficient fix of [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).  [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629#p82865> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/04/6>   Statement CVE-2012-1610:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of ImageMagick as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it did not backport the insufficient patch for [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c9)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-04-11 13:28:58 UTC  ``` Rawhide build which should fix it <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=3977291>.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:51:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0544 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0544.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c11)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-22 08:36:08 UTC  ``` ImageMagick-6.7.0.10-5.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.
