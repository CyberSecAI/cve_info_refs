{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `GetEXIFProperty()` function when processing EXIF directory entries with format 5 (EXIF_FMT_URATIONAL) and a large components count.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to `number_bytes` being 0, bypassing subsequent checks and causing out-of-bounds reads.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Out-of-bounds reads leading to a segmentation fault and a crash of the application (denial of service), and possibly arbitrary code execution.",
   "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted image file with a malicious EXIF header using ImageMagick.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted image file to be processed by a vulnerable ImageMagick application."
