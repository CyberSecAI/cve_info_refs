Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to shadow the `location` object in JavaScript using `Object.defineProperty`. This allows an attacker to redefine the `location` object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in plugins and other parts of the browser that rely on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is the ability to redefine the `location` object, which is intended to provide the current URL of the web page.
- This weakness allows for a bypass of security checks that depend on the proper functionality of the `location` object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:** By shadowing the `location` object, an attacker can trick plugins into believing the user is on a different domain than they actually are. This can enable XSS attacks where a malicious script can modify the content or steal sensitive data within the user's current domain.
- **Confused plugins:** Plugins can be fooled by the shadowed location object, allowing attacks against the plugins and their intended security measures.
- **Potential for Information disclosure and code execution:** The vulnerability might be leveraged in conjunction with other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Web Pages:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page that uses `Object.defineProperty` to shadow the `location` object.
- **User Interaction:** The user must be tricked into visiting the malicious page for the attack to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a web page that can be accessed by the victim.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of JavaScript and how `Object.defineProperty` can be used to modify object properties.
- No special privileges on the user's system is required; exploiting this vulnerability is done through the browser.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects multiple products: Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Thunderbird ESR.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 15, Firefox ESR 10.0.8, SeaMonkey 2.12, Thunderbird 15, and Thunderbird ESR 10.0.8.

- The issue was originally reported by Mariusz Mlynski.
- The vulnerability can be used to confuse the current location to plugins, allowing for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

This CVE is not about memory safety issues directly, although it can be used to leverage XSS vulnerabilities which can lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution when chained with other vulnerabilities.
