The provided content is a security advisory for multiple TYPO3 extensions, and it is related to CVE-2012-1083.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The advisory details multiple vulnerabilities across various third-party TYPO3 extensions. These vulnerabilities include:
    *   SQL Injection
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Information Disclosure
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution
    *   Open Redirection
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The listed extensions suffer from various weaknesses, such as:
    *   Improper input sanitization leading to SQL injection and XSS.
    *   Inadequate access control resulting in information disclosure.
    *   Insufficient validation allowing arbitrary code execution.
    *   Lack of proper redirection handling leading to open redirection.
    *   Missing CSRF protection leading to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of these vulnerabilities varies, including:
    *   **SQL Injection:** Could allow attackers to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and data.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or information theft.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information could be exposed to unauthorized users.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Open Redirection:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attacks are primarily network-based, exploiting vulnerabilities via HTTP requests.
    *   **User Interaction:** Some XSS vulnerabilities may require user interaction by clicking malicious links.
    *   **Backend Access:** Arbitrary code execution might require some level of backend access or a vulnerable backend component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   For some vulnerabilities, user interaction (clicking a malicious link) is required.
    *   For arbitrary code execution, in some cases, the attacker might need some level of authentication to a vulnerable backend component.

**Specific Extensions Affected and Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **mv\_cooking:** SQL Injection (Critical). Exploited in the wild.
    *   **toi\_category:** SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (Critical).
    *   **mm\_whtppr:** SQL Injection (Critical).
    *   **rtg\_files:** Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection (High).
    *   **bc\_post2facebook:** Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection (High).
    *   **sysutils:** Information Disclosure (High).
    *  **typo3\_webservice:** Arbitrary Code Execution (High). Requires some level of authentication.
    *   **css\_filelinks:** Cross-Site Scripting (Low).
    *   **irfaq:** Open Redirection, Cross-Site Scripting (Medium).
    *   **skt\_eurocalc:** Cross-Site Scripting (Medium).
    *   **ya\_googlesearch:** Cross-Site Scripting (Medium).
    *   **terminal:** Cross-Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery (Low).
    *   **beuserswitch:** Cross-Site Scripting, Information Disclosure (Low).
    *   **jftcaforms:** Cross-Site Scripting (Low).
    *   **aeurltool:** Cross-Site Scripting (Low).

**Additional Notes:**
    *   The advisory is a Collective Security Bulletin (CSB), a type of announcement used for less prominent extensions.
    *   Some extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the authors failing to provide timely fixes.
    *   The advisory provides CVSS v2.0 scores for each vulnerability, and also includes a link to a blog post explaining CVSS usage.
