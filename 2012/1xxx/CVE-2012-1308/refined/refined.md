  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The D-Link DSL-2640B's web interface is prone to CSRF vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Allows an attacker to change router parameters, including changing the default administrator password.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page containing a crafted form that submits changes to the router's settings.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious web page or otherwise causing the crafted HTTP request to be sent to the router. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the router, just have the victim visit the attacker-controlled site."
