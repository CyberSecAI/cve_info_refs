  "CVE-2012-1964": {
    "description": "A clickjacking attack using the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate error warning page (about:certerror) with the \"Add Exception\" button of a real warning page from a malicious site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate exception for a different site than the perceived one. This can lead to compromised communications with the user perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate exception has been added.",
    "vulnerability": "Clickjacking",
    "root_cause": "The certificate warning page (about:certerror) can be displayed in an iframe. The \"Add Exception\" button of the real warning page from a malicious site can be exposed in the iframe by a MITM attacker.",
    "impact": "A user can be tricked into adding a certificate exception for a malicious site, compromising future communications with the intended site.",
    "attack_vector": "A MITM attacker displays a crafted page with an iframe showing a certificate error page (about:certerror) from the malicious site. The attacker positions the legitimate certificate exception button in the iframe in a way that the user will click it, but it belongs to the malicious page, not the one in the address bar.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A MITM attacker capable of injecting content into the communication channel.",
