- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `getcity.php` script of the Hotel Booking Portal, where the `country` POST parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could potentially lead to data breaches, modification or deletion of data, or even complete compromise of the database server, allowing access to sensitive data such as usernames and passwords (as seen in the provided proof of concept which extracts the password file).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a POST request to `getcity.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `country` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `getcity.php` script of the vulnerable application.
