authentication and login as the 'root' user on the device.
The SSH private key corresponding to the following public key is
public and present on all vulnerable appliances:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAvIhC5skTzxyHif/7iy3yhxuK6/OB13hjPqrskogkYFrcW8OK4VJT+5+Fx7wd4sQCnVn8rNqahw/x6sfcOMDI/Xvn4yKU4t8TnYf2MpUVr4ndz39L5Ds1n7Si1m2suUNxWbKv58I8+NMhlt2ITraSuTU0NGymWOc8+LNi+MHXdLk= SCCP Superuser
Its fingerprint is:

## Leaders in Cyber Security

[HIRE US](#contact-us)

Since we set up in 2001, our objective has been clear - to provide the very best cyber security consultancy for our clients, enabling them to operate more efficiently and safely; to help them grow and prosper.

We do this by being recognised for thought leadership, and delivering on that promise - with the highest quality information security services and solutions - and thereby being seen and respected as a trusted advisor.

## SERVICES

We check for over 501 million passwords in a fraction of a second.

### VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Cost-effective Security Assessments Managed by our senior security consultants.**

External Vulnerability Scanning is a crucial part of every security programme. However, budgets do not always allow for the cost of an extensive consultancy-based Penetration Test.

Cost-effective automated scanners go some way to resolving this issue, but the limitations of automated systems are well-documented and understood. The reports produced contain multiple false positives, and it becomes the responsibility of the client to work through the issues to determine the real issues from the false ones. On a typical external network of 64 IP addresses, this can take between one and three full-time days for someone will the skills and up-to-date knowledge to perform.

![image](img2/penetration+testing.png)
### Penetration TESTING

Which Penetration Test is Right for You? Penetration Testing can include so many different elements, that the first challenge is first deciding what tests should be commissioned.

Matta has advisors, which can help you scope the requirements based on your objectives, budget and timescale. In a perfect world all the requirements can be met with the existing budget you had in mind. If this is not possible, however, we can suggest ways to gain the most benefit, and prioritise activities.

External Penetration Test Conducting a penetration test on the public facing network is something most companies should consider doing at least annually. Apart from the obvious reasons of good compliance, it is important to supplement any VA work you may be doing with a full consultant based Penetration Test to ensure that your network is truly as robust as you think it may be from an attacker.

![image](img2/emergency+response.png)
### Emergency response

Mattaâs incident response service comprises of a multi-disciplined and experienced incident response team that use their experience, so that you can get your business back up and running as quickly as possible.

Getting early notification of an incident helps Matta in working with you to determine an appropriate response.

## Metasploit code on Github gives remote access to BigIP

A vulnerability in F5 kit first announced in February may be in the wild, with code posted to Github purporting to be an exploit.

The original [advisory](https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/MATTA-2012-002.txt) stated that vulnerable installations of F5’s BigIP and other systems allowed an attacker to log in as root, because the vulnerability exposed the device’s SSH private key. F5 [responded](http://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/13000/600/sol13600.html) earlier this month.

Since it’s only seven days since F5 issued its advisory – and the patch – it’s likely that unpatched systems still exist.

F5 describes the issue as “A platform-specific remote access vulnerability has been discovered that may allow a remote user to gain privileged access to affected systems using SSH. The vulnerability is caused by a configuration error, and is not the result of an underlying SSH defect.”

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z5RapEx1tDYrMVKhYc7u3QAAAQs&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D426raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z5RapEx1tDYrMVKhYc7u3QAAAQs&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D4%26raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

Today, exploit code has been [posted](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/ssh/f5_bigip_known_privkey.rb) to Github. That code purports to gain remote access to some of the affected F5 systems – its BigIP devices.

The vulnerability can be addressed either by users upgrading to a non-vulnerable version, or reconfiguring SSH access (instructions are provided at the F5 link).
