Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1671:

**CVE Description:**  The provided text indicates that CVE-2012-1671 is related to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in phpPaleo.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from how `index.php` handles language settings via the `lang` GET parameter.  The code doesn't properly sanitize user input, which allows for a local file inclusion vulnerability when a null byte is used in the parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the `lang` GET parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.
* **Null Byte Injection:** The exploit relies on a null byte (`%00`) to truncate the file path, effectively bypassing file extension checks or other input validation mechanisms. This vulnerability is specific to PHP versions prior to 5.3.4 and requires that `magic_quotes_gpc` be disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the LFI vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or other configuration files. This can lead to the compromise of user credentials and other critical system information.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a modified `lang` parameter.
* **Null-byte injection:** The attacker includes a null byte in the filepath passed via the lang parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable phpPaleo application.
* The attacker needs knowledge of the server's file system to specify the files to include.
* The server needs to be running a version of PHP prior to 5.3.4 with `magic_quotes_gpc` disabled.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Mark Stanislav.
*   A patch (version 4.8b157) was released to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through code audits and binary analysis as part of research by the Secunia Research team.
