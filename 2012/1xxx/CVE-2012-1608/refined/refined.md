Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists within the TYPO3 HTML Sanitizing API, specifically the `t3lib_div::RemoveXSS()` method. This method fails to properly filter out specially crafted HTML injections because it does not remove non-printable characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the inadequate filtering of non-printable characters in HTML input.
- Insecure Input Sanitization: The `RemoveXSS()` method, designed to remove potentially malicious code, is not robust enough.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into a TYPO3 website.
- This could lead to:
  - Hijacking user sessions
  - Stealing cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting specially crafted HTML code containing non-printable characters into user-controlled input fields (e.g., forms, content elements) that are later processed by the vulnerable `RemoveXSS()` method.
- This input is then rendered in a way that allows the malicious code to execute on the client-side (user's browser).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be a backend user for this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML input into the application (e.g., through a form).
- Technical knowledge about XSS attacks and how to craft malicious HTML using non-printable characters is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information emphasizes that developers should not rely solely on `RemoveXSS()` for security, and should always properly encode user input before outputting it.
- The vulnerability was addressed in TYPO3 versions 4.4.14, 4.5.14, and 4.6.7.
- This CVE is related to a larger set of vulnerabilities found in the TYPO3 core, as described in the advisory `TYPO3-CORE-SA-2012-001`.
