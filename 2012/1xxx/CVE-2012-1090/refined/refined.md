Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `cifs_lookup()` implementation within the Linux kernel's Common Internet File System (CIFS) code. Specifically, when a lookup operation encounters a non-regular file, like a FIFO (named pipe), the code attempts to open it as a regular file, which is incorrect. This action results in a file handle leak, as the code does not properly close the handle, leading to a reference count mismatch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Handle Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to release a file handle when a non-regular file type is encountered during a CIFS lookup.
*   **Incorrect Handling of Special Files:** The code incorrectly attempts a POSIX open on special files, violating the intended use of POSIX open during lookup, which is designed for regular files.
*   **Dentry Reference Count Mismatch:** The file handle leak leads to a mismatch in the dentry reference count.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A local unprivileged user can trigger the flaw, causing a dentry reference count leak which results in a kernel panic upon unmounting the CIFS filesystem. This results in a denial of service by crashing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered by a local, unprivileged user accessing a CIFS share on the affected system.
*   **Specific File Types:** The attack involves attempting to open specific non-regular file types, like FIFOs, during lookup operations on a CIFS share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to a system with a mounted CIFS share.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not require elevated privileges to exploit this flaw.
*  **CIFS Share Access:** The attacker needs access to a CIFS share on the affected system.
*  **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create non-regular files on the CIFS share, such as named pipes.

**Additional notes:**
* The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.31 with commit `a6ce4932fbdbcd8f8e8c6df76812014351c32892`.
* The fix involves ensuring that when a lookup operation attempts a POSIX open on a file that turns out not to be a regular file it will close the filehandle, using `CIFSSMBClose()`.
* The fix was backported to older versions of the Linux kernel, such as 2.6.32 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
