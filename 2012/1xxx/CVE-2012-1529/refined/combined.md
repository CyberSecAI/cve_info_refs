Security Bulletin

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-063 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2744842)

Published: September 21, 2012

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and four privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Internet Explorer 9 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Internet Explorer 9 on Windows servers. Internet Explorer 10 is not affected. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2757760](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2757760).

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## OnMove Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1529

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1529).

#### Mitigating Factors for OnMove Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1529

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for OnMove Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1529

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

## Event Listener Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2546

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-2546](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2546).

#### Mitigating Factors for Event Listener Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2546

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Event Listener Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2546

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for cloneNode Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2557

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object in memory that has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## execCommand Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4969

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-4969](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-4969).

#### Mitigating Factors for execCommand Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4969

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for execCommand Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4969

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Apply the Microsoft Fix it solution, "Prevent Memory Corruption via** **ExecCommand** **in Internet Explorer", that prevents exploitation of this vulnerability**

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc749197) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **Setup Modes** |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| **Restart Options** |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| **Special Options** |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
