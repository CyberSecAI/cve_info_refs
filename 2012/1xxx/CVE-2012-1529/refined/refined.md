Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2012-1529:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition. Internet Explorer attempts to access an object in memory that has either not been correctly initialized or has already been deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability which occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means if a user has admin rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system.
- **Complete System Control:** An attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious website containing specially crafted content designed to trigger the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious website. This is often done via email or instant messages with a link, or through malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without prior authentication.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting the malicious site or opening a malicious email attachment.
- **Ability to Create Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the skills to create a specially crafted web page that triggers the use-after-free condition.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-063.
- The update modifies how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory to prevent the vulnerability.
- Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server mitigates but does not entirely eliminate this risk for sites not in the Trusted Zone.

**Mitigations (Workarounds):**
- Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.
- Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting.
- Use Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) for added protection layers.
- Apply the Microsoft "Fix it" solution.

The provided documents also contain information about other CVEs that are addressed in the same security bulletin (MS12-063). CVE-2012-2546, CVE-2012-2548, CVE-2012-2557, and CVE-2012-4969, all describe similar use-after-free vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
