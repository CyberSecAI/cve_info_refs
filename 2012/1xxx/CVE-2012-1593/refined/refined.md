Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference in the ANSI A dissector of Wireshark. This occurs when the dissector attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The core issue is the lack of proper validation or handling of a null pointer within the ANSI A dissector code. This makes it prone to crashing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash. This is achieved by sending a malformed packet with a crafted structure.
- The crash can occur when the application attempts to dissect a malformed network packet or opens a malformed packet capture file, rendering it unusable until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network injection: An attacker can inject a malformed ANSI A packet onto the network, which if captured and processed by wireshark will cause a crash.
- Malicious Packet Capture file: An attacker can convince a user to open a malformed packet capture (pcap) file with Wireshark leading to the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either inject network packets that can be captured by a Wireshark instance, or be able to make the user open a specially crafted malicious pcap file with wireshark.
- A low to medium level of skill would be required to craft the malformed packets.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 1.4.0 through 1.4.11
- Wireshark versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.5

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 1.4.12
- Wireshark versions 1.6.6 or later
