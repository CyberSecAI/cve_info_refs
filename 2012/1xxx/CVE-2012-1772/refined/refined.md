Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Oracle Outside In libraries, specifically in the parser for PCX files. These libraries are used by various applications to decode different file formats. A malformed PCX file can trigger a flaw in the parser, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed PCX files by the Oracle Outside In library.
- Vulnerable file parsing logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application.
- System compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise if the affected application runs with elevated privileges.
- Data manipulation: Attackers could potentially view, change, or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs when an application uses the vulnerable Oracle Outside In libraries to process a specially crafted PCX file.
- Attackers can deliver the malicious file via email attachments, malicious websites, or other means.
- In the case of Microsoft Exchange, an attacker could send a malicious email, and when the user previews the attachment using Outlook Web App (OWA), the code may be executed on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted PCX file that triggers the vulnerability.
- Ability to deliver the crafted PCX file to a system that uses the vulnerable Oracle Outside In library.
- Unauthenticated remote access is sufficient for exploitation.

**Additional Information from Content:**
-  The vulnerability is present in multiple file parsers within the Oracle Outside In library, including .VSD, .WSD, .JP2, .DOC, .SXD, .LWP, .PCX, .SXI, .DPT, .PDF, .SAM, .ODG, and .CDR.
-  A large number of vendors and products are affected including, but not limited to: Microsoft Exchange, Google Search Appliance, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Guidance Encase Forensics, AccessData FTK, Novell Groupwise.
-  Microsoft issued security updates (MS12-058 and MS12-067) to address this vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange and FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint respectively.
-  Workarounds, such as disabling WebReady document viewing in Exchange and disabling the Advanced Filter Pack in FAST Search Server, could temporarily mitigate the risk.
-  The vulnerability was reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS base score of 10, indicating its critical severity.
