Subject: CVE Request: nginx fix for malformed HTTP responses from upstream servers

Hello,

The nginx team has released stable version 1.0.14, and development
version 1.1.17 of nginx web server, which include a fix for malformed
HTTP responses from upstream servers:

<http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/changeset/4535/nginx>
<http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/changeset/4531/nginx>
<http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/changeset/4530/nginx>

<http://nginx.org/en/security_advisories.html>

Without this fix contents of previously freed memory might be sent to
a client if an upstream server returned specially crafted response,
potentially resulting in sensitive information leak.

Patch which can be applied to the earlier versions of nginx is here:
<http://nginx.org/download/patch.2012.memory.txt>

Thanks to Matthew Daley for spotting this one.

Package        : nginx
Vulnerability  : sensitive information leak
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1180
Debian Bug     : 664137

Matthew Daley discovered a memory disclosure vulnerability in nginx. In
previous versions of this web server, an attacker can receive the content of
previously freed memory if an upstream server returned a specially crafted HTTP
response, potentially exposing sensitive information.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.67-3+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.17-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our

| [Description](#c0)  Anders Rune Jensen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-09-22 14:42:04 UTC  ``` ksyms has changed syntax to: Usage: ksyms filename [args] But the man page has not yet been updated. This is a problem with module-init-tools.  pcmcia uses ksyms -a to see what symbol the kernel has (to check if pcmcia is compiled in). If it can't get an acceptable output from ksyms -a it will look in  /proc/ksyms. In 2.6 and module-init-tools 0.9.15 this should be /proc/kallsyms.  Also it complain that module-init-tools 0.9.15 is an too old version and that it requires 2.x something.  Fixing these two things allows me to compile pcmcmia-cs. It works perfekt for me. It would be good if you could fix this somehow.  Thanx.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Peter Johanson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-27 09:40:55 UTC  ``` Okay, pcmcia-cs-3.2.5 which is in stable now has a fix for module-init-tools that has been tested and seems to work fine. Please re-open if you still experience problems. ``` |  |

Hello!

Matthew Daley recently discovered a security problem which may
lead to a disclosure of previously freed memory on specially
crafted response from an upstream server, potentially resulting in
sensitive information leak.

Patch for the problem can be found here:

<http://nginx.org/download/patch.2012.memory.txt>

The patch is not required for 1.1.17, 1.0.14.

Maxim Dounin

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This is a nicely formatted CVE request. In future if you want a CVE in
advance you can request one via the VS list and I'll be happy to assign
it privately there.

Please use CVE-2012-1180 for this issue.

# nginx: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/nginx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.14** |

### Background

nginx is a robust, small, and high performance HTTP and reverse proxy
server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx:

* The TLS protocol does not properly handle session renegotiation
  requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The "ngx\_http\_process\_request\_headers()" function in ngx\_http\_parse.c
  could cause a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-3896).
* nginx does not properly sanitize user input for the the WebDAV COPY
  or MOVE methods (CVE-2009-3898).
* The "ngx\_resolver\_copy()" function in ngx\_resolver.c contains a
  boundary error which could cause a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2011-4315).
* nginx does not properly parse HTTP header responses which could
  expose sensitive information (CVE-2012-1180).

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the nginx process, cause a Denial of Service condition,
create or overwrite arbitrary files, or obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nginx users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/nginx-1.0.14"

```
