    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, it occurs when the browser attempts to access a deleted object.",

    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the same privileges as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, this could lead to complete control of the system.",
        "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a malicious webpage hosted by an attacker. The user would need to be convinced to visit this malicious webpage.",
