Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer's CSS expressions within the WEB MART application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is susceptible to XSS attacks due to the improper handling of user-controlled input within CSS expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the user's web browser when they view a page using the vulnerable software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack can be launched over the internet using specially crafted network packets.
- User interaction: The user must be convinced to interact with a link or view a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to authenticate, thus can be anonymous.
- The attacker needs to inject malicious code into the CSS expressions, which could be achieved through various vectors like manipulating data that the application uses to generate CSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects users of Microsoft Internet Explorer because it exploits the browser's handling of CSS expressions.
- The vulnerability is present in WEB MART versions 1.7 and earlier.
- JPCERT/CC has analyzed the vulnerability and rated the required user interaction as Medium, while the access and authentication requirements are considered High. Exploit complexity was also rated as high.
