Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2012-1512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vSphere Client has an internal browser that renders HTML pages from log file entries. This browser does not properly sanitize input, allowing the execution of scripts introduced into the log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Input validation vulnerability: The internal browser in vSphere Client fails to properly sanitize input from log files.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): Malicious script can be injected into log files and executed when a user opens a malicious log file entry.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Script execution: An attacker can inject and run malicious scripts within the context of the vSphere client.
- Privilege escalation: The script would run with the permissions of the user running the vSphere Client, potentially allowing for privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Log file injection: An attacker would need to find a way to insert malicious script into a log file that the vSphere client is configured to access.
- User interaction: The user would need to open a specific log file entry containing the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to modify or inject log files that are accessed by the vSphere client.
- Requires a victim to open a log file entry containing the malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vSphere Client versions affected are those included in vSphere 5.0 and vSphere 4.1. The vSphere Client that comes with vSphere 4.0 and vCenter Server 2.5 are not affected.
- The vulnerability is resolved by installing the vSphere Client of the vSphere 5.0 Update 1 release or the vSphere 4.1 Update 2 release.
- This vulnerability is specifically related to the vSphere Client and not the ESXi or ESX hosts directly.
