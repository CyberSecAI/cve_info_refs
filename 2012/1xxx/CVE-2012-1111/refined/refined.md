Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1111:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `lightdm` display manager leaks file descriptors to child processes it creates for user sessions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **File descriptor leakage:** `lightdm` was not properly closing file descriptors before spawning child processes, resulting in these processes inheriting open file descriptors.
- **Privilege escalation via log file access:** Leaked file descriptors included a write-enabled file descriptor to `/var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log`, a log file owned by root.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Log file tampering:** A local attacker could write to the `lightdm` log file, potentially injecting arbitrary log entries or causing log corruption.
- **Denial of service (potential):** The leaked file descriptors included pipes used for internal communication within the `lightdm` daemon, allowing a local attacker to potentially disrupt `lightdm` functionality (by simulating SIGTERM).
- **Unknown impacts:** The vulnerability details mention the possibility of "another unknown impact" due to the file descriptor leakage.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Exploitation:** A local user could exploit the leaked file descriptors to gain unintended access to resources or manipulate the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A local user with the ability to execute commands and programs on the affected system.

**Additional Notes**

*   The leaked file descriptors included not only the log file, but also pipes used for inter-process communication, potentially allowing a local attacker to cause a denial of service.
*   The issue was fixed by ensuring that file descriptors were closed before spawning new processes.
*   Patches were created for both the 1.0 branch and the trunk of lightdm, along with regression tests to ensure the issue was resolved.
* The issue affects multiple distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, and openSUSE.
* Patches were made available for lightdm versions 1.0.6-0ubuntu1.4 (Ubuntu Oneiric), and 1.1.6-0ubuntu1 (Ubuntu Precise), 1.0.8 (Debian) and 1.0.9 (openSUSE).
