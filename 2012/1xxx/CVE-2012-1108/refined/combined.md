```
Hello all,

Dhanesh K. and myself had performed a vulnerability assessment of the
taglib library(<http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html>). A few
vulnerabilities that were found include :-

- Sanity checks are not performed for fields read from a media file, which
are used to allocate memory later on. Causes DoS due to application crash
at the very least, exploitability is unconfirmed.

An example :-
apeitem.cpp
  APE::Item::parse(const ByteVector &data)
    d->key = String(data.mid(8), String::UTF8);

- ogg/xiphcomment.cpp, Ogg::XiphComment::parse(const ByteVector &data)
    Control over "vendorLength" and can cause a string allocation with that
size. Control over "commentFields" which is the number of times,
"commentLength" is read and a string of size "commandLength" is allocated.
Causes DoS due to application crash at the very least, exploitability is
unconfirmed.

- ape/apeproperties.cpp, APE::Properties::analyzeCurrent()
    Specially crafted ape media files with sampleRate being "0" could lead
to application crash, division by zero error.

    d->sampleRate = header.mid(20, 4).toUInt(false);
    d->length = totalBlocks / d->sampleRate;

- crafted ogg file with a 1 bit change(0=>1) at the offset 0x0000007f leads
to an infinite loop in the thread processing the tags.

Regards,
Zubin Mithra

# TagLib: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in TagLib, possibly
resulting in Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/taglib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.1** |

### Background

TagLib is a library for reading and editing audio meta data.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in TagLib:

* The "analyzeCurrent()" function in ape/apeproperties.cpp contains a
  division by zero error (CVE-2012-1107).
* The "parse()" function in inogg/xiphcomment.cpp contains an error
  when processing the "vendorLength" field (CVE-2012-1108).
* The "mid()" function in toolkit/tbytevector.cpp contains an integer
  overflow error (CVE-2012-1584).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted OGG file with an application using TagLib, possibly
resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TagLib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/taglib-1.7.1"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these
packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
