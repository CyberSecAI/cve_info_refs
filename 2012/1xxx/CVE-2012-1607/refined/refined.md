Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1607:

**CVE-2012-1607**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the TYPO3 Command Line Interface (CLI) potentially disclosing sensitive information. Specifically, accessing a CLI script directly through a web browser could reveal the database name used for the TYPO3 installation. This is due to insufficient access control and information exposure.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintended exposure of the database name.
    *   **Lack of Access Control:** The system fails to prevent unauthorized access to CLI scripts via a web browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could learn the database name used by the TYPO3 installation. While this might not be a critical issue alone, it is valuable information for further attacks. It provides reconnaissance information that may be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to potentially compromise the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Browser Access:** The attack vector involves an attacker directly accessing a TYPO3 CLI script through a web browser, without going through the intended access controls.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
    *   **Knowledge of Script Location:** The attacker would need to know or guess the location of CLI scripts that would disclose the database name.
