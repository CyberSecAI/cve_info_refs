    "Metadata": {
      "source": "Multiple",
      "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012:0710, https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012:0715, https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce@lists.opensuse.org/message/7KHZ4MSWSEPML5ZCTQIRXDAWPADLGRGM/, https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce@lists.opensuse.org/message/477DOVJQJ76CNTBETRLT65UL6SGNO46Z/, https://wiki.mozilla.org/BMO/UserGuide/BugFields, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=750066, https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2012-40/, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=827843",

    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `nsHTMLReflowState::CalculateHypotheticalBox` function due to improper handling of nested columns with a combination of absolute and relative positioning when a window is resized.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected software.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious web page with nested columns and a specific combination of absolute and relative positioning, then forcing a resize of the browser window or client to trigger the overflow. An attacker could also potentially exploit this through other means of viewing content such as an RSS feed in Thunderbird.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to view the specially crafted content, either via web browsing or through a similar vector such as a mail client."
