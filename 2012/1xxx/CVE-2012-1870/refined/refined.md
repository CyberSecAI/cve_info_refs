Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a design flaw in the TLS protocol when Cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode of operation is used. This is not a flaw specific to any implementation, but a protocol-level issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is that an attacker can potentially decrypt portions of encrypted TLS traffic when CBC mode is used. This breaks the confidentiality of the communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of Encrypted Traffic:** An attacker could intercept and decrypt TLS-encrypted traffic, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Authentication Cookie Theft:** Specifically, the attacker could potentially decrypt authentication cookies, enabling them to impersonate legitimate users and gain access to protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a client and a server. This could be achieved through various man-in-the-middle (MitM) techniques.
*   **Malicious Code Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious code into an HTTP response or host a malicious website that forces the browser to send several requests to a third party HTTPS website within the same TLS session.
*   **Browser as Attack Vector**: The attack primarily uses the browser, so client systems are at higher risk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept encrypted HTTPS traffic.
*   **Ability to Inject or Host Malicious Content**: The attacker must be able to inject malicious HTTP responses or serve malicious web pages to force the client to generate multiple requests within the same TLS session.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Cipher Suites:** The vulnerability only affects cipher suites that use CBC mode, such as AES. Cipher suites using RC4 algorithm are not affected.
*   **Mitigation**: Prioritizing the RC4 algorithm can be used as a workaround to avoid the vulnerable CBC mode, however both server and client must support RC4.
*   **Affected Systems**: Workstations or terminal servers that send and receive HTTPS traffic are particularly at risk.
* **Public Disclosure**: The vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin.
* **No Known Exploitation**: At the time of the bulletin, there were no reported cases of active exploitation against customers, though proof of concept code was available.

**Summary:** This vulnerability in the TLS protocol allows for information disclosure by decrypting encrypted traffic when CBC mode is used, potentially leading to unauthorized access via cookie theft. Attackers require a MitM position and need to inject or host malicious content to trigger the vulnerability.
