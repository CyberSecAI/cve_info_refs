An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
perl-YAML-LibYAML was updated to version 0.59 to fix four security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2013-6393: The yaml\_parser\_scan\_tag\_uri function in scanner.c in
LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow (bnc#860617, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2012-1152: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the error
reporting functionality in the YAML::LibYAML (aka YAML-LibYAML and
perl-YAML-LibYAML) module 0.38 for Perl allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (process crash) via format string specifiers
in a (1) YAML stream to the Load function, (2) YAML node to the
load\_node function, (3) YAML mapping to the load\_mapping function, or
(4) YAML sequence to the load\_sequence function (bnc#751503).
- CVE-2014-9130: scanner.c in LibYAML 0.1.5 and 0.1.6, as used in the
YAML-LibYAML (aka YAML-XS) module for Perl, allowed context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and crash) via
vectors involving line-wrapping (bnc#907809, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2014-2525: Heap-based buffer overflow in the
yaml\_parser\_scan\_uri\_escapes function in LibYAML before 0.1.6 allowed
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URI in a YAML file
(bnc#868944, bnc#911782).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- PR/23 Better scalar dump heuristics
- More closely match YAML.pm
- Add a VERSION statement to YAML::LibYAML (issue#8)
- Applied fix for PR/21. nawglan++
- Use Swim cpan-tail block functions in doc
- Get YAML::XS using latest libyaml
- Fix for
<https://bitbucket.org/xi/libyaml/issue/10/wrapped-strings-cause-assert-fail>
ure
- Fix e1 test failure on 5.21.4
- Remove =travis section
- Meta 0.0.2
- Eliminate spurious trailing whitespace
- Add t/000-compile-modules.t
- Fix swim errors
- Add badges to doc
- Fix ReadMe
- Fix Meta and add Contributing.
- Doc fix. GitHub-Issue-#6. Thanks to Debian Perl Group for finding this.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=801738#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-09 10:24:03 UTC  ``` Multiple format string flaws were found in the way perl-YAML-LibYAML, Perl YAML serialization using XS and libyaml, performed: 1) error reporting by loading of general YAML stream, 2) error reporting by loading of YAML node, 3) error reporting by loading of YAML mapping into a Perl hash, and 4) error reporting by loading of YAML sequence into a Perl array.  A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document, which once processed by the perl-YAML-LibYAML interface would lead to perl-YAML-LibYAML based process crash.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- libdbd-pg-perl / perl-DBD-Pg && libyaml-libyaml-perl
 / perl-YAML-LibYAML: Multiple format string flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

Case #1:
========
Two format string flaws were found in the way perl-DBD-Pg, a Perl language
PostgreSQL DBI implementation, performed:
1) turning of database notices into appropriate Perl language warning messages,
2) preparation of particular DBD statement.

A rogue server could provide a specially-crafted database warning or
specially-crafted DBD statement, which once processed by the perl-DBD-Pg
interface would lead to perl-DBD-Pg based process crash.

CPAN ticket:
[3] <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75642>

Patch proposed by Niko Tyni:
[4]
<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Attachment/1047954/547725/0001-Explicitly-warn-and-croak-with-controlled-format-str.patch>

Case #2:
========
Multiple format string flaws were found in the way perl-YAML-LibYAML, Perl YAML
serialization using XS and libyaml, performed:
1) error reporting by loading of general YAML stream,
2) error reporting by loading of YAML node,
3) error reporting by loading of YAML mapping into a Perl hash, and
4) error reporting by loading of YAML sequence into a Perl array.

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document, which once
processed by the perl-YAML-LibYAML interface would lead to perl-YAML-LibYAML
based process crash.

Proposed patch:
[5] <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Attachment/920541/477607/YAML-LibYAML-0.35-format-error.patch>

Could you allocate two CVE ids for these? (one for libdbd-pg-perl / perl-DBD-Pg
and one for libyaml-libyaml-perl / perl-YAML-LibYAML)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Subject: libyaml-libyaml-perl: FTBFS with hardening flags enabled:
-Werror=format-security
Date: Mon, 27 Feb 2012 21:44:42 +0000
```
Source: libyaml-libyaml-perl
Severity: normal
Version: 0.38-1
User: debian-qa@lists.debian.org
Usertags: hardening-format-security hardening

With hardening flags enabled, this package FTBFS:

perl_libyaml.c: In function 'Load':
perl_libyaml.c:191:5: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]
perl_libyaml.c: In function 'load_node':
perl_libyaml.c:274:9: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]
perl_libyaml.c: In function 'load_mapping':
perl_libyaml.c:318:9: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]
perl_libyaml.c: In function 'load_sequence':
perl_libyaml.c:351:9: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]
cc1: some warnings being treated as errors

(this is the first error of this type seen: it's possible that there
could be others once this is fixed).

A likely fix is to change croak(var) to croak("%s", var)[1], or similar.

Note that I haven't verified whether an externally-controlled string is
used; if so, it would be appropriate to upgrade this bug RC severity
with the security tag[2].

This was found during testing of perl 5.14.2-8 in experimental; however,
since that version was prepared, it has been decided not to export
those build flags in Config_heay.pl. Nevertheless, it is likely that at
some point, either in debhelper 9 or 10, the hardening flags will be
enabled for all perl modules.

Thanks,
Dominic.

These format strings can be injected from user input,
so raising the severity. A DSA will be issued for squeeze.

I've just notified upstream via the RT tickets below. Could somebody from
the pkg-perl team please prepare updated packages (built with -sa for
stable-security as this is new there)?  Trivial patches can be found in

Are you going to prepare the upload for it? In other case I have
prepared the branch in our git repository with the fix taken from
Upstream RT#46507 patch there.

A review would anyway be welcome.

# CVE-2012-1152

| **Name** | CVE-2012-1152 |

| **Description** | Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the error reporting functionality in the YAML::LibYAML (aka YAML-LibYAML and perl-YAML-LibYAML) module 0.38 for Perl allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via format string specifiers in a (1) YAML stream to the Load function, (2) YAML node to the load\_node function, (3) YAML mapping to the load\_mapping function, or (4) YAML sequence to the load\_sequence function. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
