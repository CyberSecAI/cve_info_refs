{
  "CVE-2012-1152": {
    "Description": "Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the error reporting functionality in the YAML::LibYAML (aka YAML-LibYAML and perl-YAML-LibYAML) module 0.38 for Perl allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via format string specifiers in a (1) YAML stream to the Load function, (2) YAML node to the load_node function, (3) YAML mapping to the load_mapping function, or (4) YAML sequence to the load_sequence function.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of format strings in error reporting within the YAML::LibYAML module. Specifically, when processing YAML data, the module uses potentially attacker-controlled data as format strings in functions like `Load`, `load_node`, `load_mapping`, and `load_sequence` when generating error messages.  This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Format String Vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (process crash) by providing a specially-crafted YAML document containing format string specifiers.  It is also mentioned that arbitrary code execution is potentially possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted YAML document to an application using the vulnerable `perl-YAML-LibYAML` library.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted YAML document to a process that uses the vulnerable `perl-YAML-LibYAML` library. This implies a position where the attacker can either directly control the input to a vulnerable application, or be able to induce the vulnerable application to load a malicious YAML document from a remote location."
