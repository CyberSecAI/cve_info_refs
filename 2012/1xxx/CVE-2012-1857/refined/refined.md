Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in Microsoft Dynamics AX Enterprise Portal.
*   The root cause is improper handling of malicious JavaScript elements within specially crafted URLs. This allows the script to be echoed back to the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where unsanitized user input (in this case, a crafted URL) is reflected back to the user's browser, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute commands within the context of the authenticated user. This could lead to unauthorized actions within the Dynamics AX environment.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read content they are not authorized to access.
*   **Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious code into the user's browser, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attacks:** An attacker could send an email containing a specially crafted URL. If the user clicks the link, the vulnerability could be exploited.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing a specially crafted URL that, when clicked, targets a vulnerable Dynamics AX Enterprise Portal site. Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content could also be used to host malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious URLs:** Attackers need the ability to create URLs with malicious JavaScript elements.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the victim to click the malicious URL, either directly in an email or through a link on a website.
*   **Targeted Dynamics AX Environment:** The attacker needs to target a user who interacts with a vulnerable Microsoft Dynamics AX Enterprise Portal.

**Additional Details:**

*   The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 provides a mitigating factor when browsing in the Internet Zone, but not by default in the Intranet Zone.
*   The Microsoft Exploitability Index rates this vulnerability as "Important".
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited prior to the security update release.

In summary, CVE-2012-1857 is an XSS vulnerability in Microsoft Dynamics AX Enterprise Portal that can lead to elevation of privilege, information disclosure, and malicious content injection through specially crafted URLs. The vulnerability requires user interaction, such as clicking a malicious link, to be exploited.
