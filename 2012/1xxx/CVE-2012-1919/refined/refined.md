Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-1919, as described in the CERT vulnerability note VU#743555:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

The @Mail Open 1.04 webmail client is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:**
    *   **Description:** The application allows uploading files with dangerous extensions (e.g., .php).
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can upload a backdoor PHP shell, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal:**
    *   **Description:** The `compose.php` script is vulnerable to directory traversal using relative path sequences (e.g., `../`).
    *  **Impact:** Attackers can potentially access files outside the intended directory.
*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:**
    *   **Description:** The `compose.php` and `SendMsg.php` scripts, along with `mime.php`, are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, allowing file copying and arbitrary file reads.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially copy arbitrary files from the server file system to a publicly accessible location and read arbitrary files.
*   **CWE-200: Information Exposure:**
    *   **Description:** The `info.php` script calls `phpinfo()`, which may expose sensitive system configuration information.
    *   **Impact:** This could reveal internal system information to unauthorized users, aiding further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** All vulnerabilities are exploited via specially crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable scripts (`compose.php`, `SendMsg.php`, `mime.php`, and `info.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the webmail application.
*   **Web Access:** Attackers can be external and can exploit it remotely.
*   **Some of these require a valid account:** Based on the CVSS vector, a valid account on the server is required for some of these attacks (Au:S).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Uploading a backdoor shell can lead to full control of the webserver.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read, and write/copy arbitrary files on the server, leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial-of-service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive system configuration information can be exposed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Sergey Scherbel of Positive Technologies (as described in PT-2011-48).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in @Mail Open 1.05.
