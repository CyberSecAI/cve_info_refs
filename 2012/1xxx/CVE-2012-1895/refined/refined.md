Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-1895:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the .NET Framework improperly validating the permissions of certain objects during reflection. This improper validation allows for the bypass of security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Reflection Bypass:** The core vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of permissions when .NET Framework objects perform reflection. This flaw enables attackers to potentially circumvent intended security boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to an elevation of privilege, where an attacker gains control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to the installation of malware, modification of data, or creation of new accounts with full user rights.
- **Complete System Control:** With elevated privileges, an attacker could take complete control of a system, allowing them to perform various malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Browsing Scenario:**
    - An attacker could host a malicious website containing a specially crafted XBAP (XAML Browser Application).
    - By convincing a user to visit this website, the attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
    - Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also be used to host malicious XBAPs.
- **Windows .NET Application Scenario:**
    - The vulnerability can be used to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions in Windows .NET Framework applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Browsing Scenario:**
    - The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website, either by enticing them via links or compromising a legitimate website.
- **Windows .NET Application Scenario:**
    - The attacker needs to find or create a Windows .NET Framework application that runs with insufficient security restrictions.
    - They must then find an opportunity to have the application execute a malicious action, which could be by luring a user or a vulnerability in a program.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need a privileged position; they just need a way to get the user to run their malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in various versions of the .NET Framework, including 1.0 SP3, 1.1 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 3.5, 3.5.1, 4, and 4.5.
- Microsoft rates the severity as "Important" with a "Elevation of Privilege" security impact for this vulnerability.

This analysis highlights the core technical details of CVE-2012-1895, explaining the root cause, impact, and how attackers could potentially exploit it.
