Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-1890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the improper handling of keyboard layout files by the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). This driver is a core component of the Windows OS responsible for managing user input and the graphical interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation within the Windows kernel-mode driver when processing keyboard layout files. This allows an attacker to potentially supply a malformed or crafted keyboard layout file which could trigger a vulnerability in the way the driver handles this file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel mode. This is the most privileged level of access in a Windows system, granting the attacker the ability to:
* Install programs.
* View, change, or delete data.
* Create new accounts with full administrative privileges.

In essence, the attacker gains complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves the attacker logging into the system with valid credentials, then running a specially crafted application which exploits the vulnerability within the kernel mode driver. This crafted application would need to load and interact with the malformed keyboard layout file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the following:
* **Valid logon credentials:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
* **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to log on locally to the system. Remote exploitation is not directly discussed, making the attack more of a local privilege escalation.
* **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs the ability to run a crafted application on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-047.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed, and acknowledged by Microsoft with attribution to  Nicolas Economou of Core Security Technologies and Qihoo 360 Security Center
*   The fix involves correcting the way that the Windows kernel-mode driver handles keyboard layout files.

This vulnerability falls under the category of a local privilege escalation, requiring an attacker to already have a foothold on the target machine. The severity is rated "Important" because of the ability of an attacker to gain full control once exploited.
