Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1190

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of database names within the phpMyAdmin replication setup. Specifically, a crafted database name can be used to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability due to the improper handling of user-provided database names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies)
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Other malicious actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted database name. The attacker would need to create or manipulate a database name containing malicious JavaScript code.
- The victim would have to willingly click on a database name which contains the XSS payload within the replication setup page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create a database with a malicious name or to be able to modify an existing database name. They could have privileges to create/modify databases in the server.
- The attacker would also need the victim to access the replication setup page and to click on the malicious database name.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered non-critical by phpMyAdmin because the user must click on a database name that shows a possible XSS.
- The vulnerable versions are phpMyAdmin 3.4.x.
- The fix involves upgrading to phpMyAdmin 3.4.10.1 or newer or applying a patch that ensures database names are properly escaped before being displayed.
