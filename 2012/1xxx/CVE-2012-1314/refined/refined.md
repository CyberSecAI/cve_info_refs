Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1314:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is located within the Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature of Cisco IOS Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists that can be triggered by sending transit traffic through a router with WAAS Express or MACE enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the router to leak memory or reload.
- Repeated exploits can lead to a sustained DoS condition.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by sending transit traffic through a router configured with WAAS Express.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable router, through an interface where WAAS Express is enabled.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present when the `mace enable` or `waas enable` interface configuration commands are used on a Cisco router running IOS.
- WAAS Express allows traffic optimization through a Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR G2) without requiring additional devices.
- The Measurement, Aggregation, and Correlation Engine (MACE) is used for network traffic measurement and analysis and may be used alongside WAAS Express.
- The vulnerability is associated with Cisco bug ID CSCtt45381.
- This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2012-1312, which affects the MACE feature and causes router reloads.
- No workarounds are available.
- The advisory provides a table outlining affected IOS software versions and the corresponding first fixed releases.
