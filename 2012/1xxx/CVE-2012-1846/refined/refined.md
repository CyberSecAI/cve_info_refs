It should be noted that the text does not directly mention the CVE ID in question but given the facts above it can be said this article is related to the nature of the vulnerability covered by the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a "zero-day" vulnerability. This means it is an undisclosed flaw in the software, unknown to the vendor.
- In this case, the vulnerability resided in Google Chrome.
- The article mentions that an exploit was developed that bypassed Chrome's security protections allowing a complete hijack of the target computer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The specific weakness was a zero-day exploit within the Chrome browser, that when combined with a rigged website could completely compromise a target machine.
- The vulnerability allowed for the complete hijacking of a target computer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allowed attackers to completely take control of the target's computer.
- This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or any other actions an attacker could perform on a compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector was through a rigged website.
- Visiting this website would trigger the zero-day exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker required technical expertise in identifying and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.
- The attacker needed to create a rigged website to deliver the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The article emphasizes that Vupen, the company that developed the exploit, did not disclose the vulnerability to Google.
- Vupen sells these types of zero-day exploits to government agencies for offensive purposes.
- The article highlights an ethical dilemma with the selling of these types of vulnerabilities to governments that may use them for espionage or surveillance of targets.
