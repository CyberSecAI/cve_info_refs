**CVE-2012-1654**

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Software:** Drupal "Data" module
*   **Root cause:** The Drupal "Data" module is vulnerable to XSS. This means that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in a web page.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable field of "Data" module. If the code is not properly sanitized, it will be executed when the page is viewed by other users.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Stealing sensitive user information.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into a field handled by the "Data" module. This could potentially involve privileged access to add or modify data on the site, or an interface that allows untrusted users to add such data..
