Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-1514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vShield Manager (vSM) interface has a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   CSRF vulnerability: The vSM interface does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to potentially forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially force an authenticated user to forward malicious requests to the server. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on the vShield Manager system. The specific impact would depend on the nature of the forged request.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in, authenticated user into clicking on a malicious link. This link would be crafted to submit a forged request to the vShield Manager server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to convince an authenticated vShield Manager user to click on the malicious link while they are logged into vShield Manager. This could be achieved through social engineering or other methods of tricking the user.
*   The attacker does not need to have prior access to the vShield Manager system. The attack relies on exploiting the trust between the user's browser and the server.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided document indicates that this vulnerability affects vShield Manager versions 4.1 and 1.0, and is resolved in vShield Manager 4.1.0 Update 2 and vShield Zones 1.0.1 Update 2
