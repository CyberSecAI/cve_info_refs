      "details": "Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found in WonderDesk. The vulnerabilities are present in the customer password recovery page and in several fields when modifying a help desk record (Web Site, Example URL, Subject, Correspondence).\n\n**Vulnerability 1:**\n*   **Location:** Customer password recovery page.\n*   **Attack Vector:** The email address field on the password recovery form is vulnerable to XSS. By injecting malicious code into this field, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.\n*   **Root Cause:**  Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input in the email address field of the password recovery form.\n*   **Impact:** An attacker can steal cookies, perform XSS phishing attacks, or redirect users to malicious websites by injecting malicious code into the vulnerable email address field.\n*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable page with the malicious payload in the email address field. \n\n**Vulnerability 2:**\n*   **Location:** Help desk record modification page.\n*   **Attack Vector:** Several fields (Web Site, Example URL, Subject, Correspondence) in the help desk record modification page are vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into these fields, and the injected code will be executed when the record is viewed by another user.\n*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input in the mentioned fields when modifying help desk records.\n*  **Impact:** This could lead to persistent attacks on users of the help desk system. An attacker could steal cookies, perform phishing attacks, or inject arbitrary content into pages that other users view.\n*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be logged into the application and have the ability to modify help desk records.\n\nThe blog post also mentions that a large number of educational sites are vulnerable to the described XSS issues."
