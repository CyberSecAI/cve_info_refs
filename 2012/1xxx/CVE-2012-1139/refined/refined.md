  "CVE-2012-1139": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2012-1139",
      "Description": "Mateusz Jurczyk discovered that FreeType did not correctly handle certain malformed BDF font files. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted font file, a remote attacker could cause FreeType to crash."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an array index error within the BDF parser in FreeType, specifically during the processing of glyph information, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Array index error in BDF parser.",
        "Out-of-bounds read leading to possible application crash"
      ],
       "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause the FreeType library to crash, leading to denial of service when a user loads a malicious font file.  In some cases, this could possibly be leveraged to execute code within the user's context.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted BDF font file."
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious BDF font file and then trick a user to open this file."
    }
  }
