Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-1101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `systemd` handled the loading of configurations for non-existent services. When a user requested the status of a service that didn't exist (e.g., via `systemctl status non-existent.service`), `systemd` would create an entry for it in its service list, even if the service failed to load. These failed-to-load units were not being cleaned up.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Cleanup:** `systemd` did not garbage collect units that failed to load. This means that each attempt to load a non-existent service added an entry to the internal unit list.
*   **Unbounded Resource Consumption:** The unit list had a limit (reportedly 128k). By repeatedly requesting the status of non-existent services, an attacker could fill this list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Once the unit list reached its limit, the system could experience a denial of service. Specifically, the login procedure could fail, preventing users from logging in.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User:** A local user on the system could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute `systemctl` commands.

**Technical Details & Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding the failed unit to the garbage collection queue, ensuring that entries for non-existent services are cleaned up.
*   The fix was implemented in git commit `9a46fc3b9014de1bf0ed1f3004a536b08a19ebb3`.
*   The issue was initially reported as a bug (`680122`) and was later recognized as a security issue.
*   The vulnerability was present in systemd version 37-1.
*   The fix is included in systemd version 43-1.
*   The provided links show the fix in `src/unit.c` where the call to `unit_add_to_gc_queue(u)` was added in case of `UNIT_ERROR` state of the unit.

This vulnerability is specific to how systemd managed unit loading and its garbage collection process and did not affect the systemd package within Fedora releases of 15 and 16.
