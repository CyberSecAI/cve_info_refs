{
  "CVE-2012-1569": {
    "description": "The asn1_get_length_der function in decoding.c in GNU Libtasn1, as used in GnuTLS, did not properly handle certain large length values, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ASN.1 structure.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `asn1_get_length_der` function within the libtasn1 library, specifically how it handles the decoding of length fields in DER encoded data. This function did not validate that the length it returned was reasonable given the buffer size. Callers of this function were expected to do the validation, but often did not.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation: The function itself did not validate the decoded length, leading to out-of-bounds access if a crafted DER structure specifies a large length.",
      "Lack of caller-side validation: The reliance on the caller to validate the decoded length proved to be insufficient, as many callers did not perform these checks, resulting in a vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a heap memory corruption, application crash or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote and involves sending a specially crafted DER encoded input such as a X.509 certificate. This crafted input triggers the vulnerability through the `asn1_get_length_der` function during parsing.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a DER encoded input with an oversized length field, and transmit that input to a service or application that makes use of the vulnerable libtasn1 library."
