  "CVE-2012-1136": {
    "description": "An out-of heap-based buffer write flaw was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine performed parsing of glyph and bitmaps information for glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF) font files, that were missing definition of the ENCODING field. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted BDF font file, which once opened in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that application crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "vulnerability": "Out-of heap-based buffer write",
    "impact": "Application crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted font file.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to create a malformed BDF font file with a missing ENCODING field.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of BDF font files lacking the ENCODING field within the FreeType font rendering engine."
