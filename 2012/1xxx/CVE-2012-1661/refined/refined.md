Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper prompting or filtering by ESRI ArcGIS when executing embedded VBA code within a map file (.mxd). The application fails to warn the user before executing embedded VBA code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code.
- **Lack of User Prompt:** The application does not prompt the user for confirmation before executing VBA macros.
- **Unfiltered Email Attachments:** .mxd files are not typically filtered by email systems, making it easy to deliver malicious files via email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote System Compromise:** An attacker can gain control over a user's system by tricking them into opening a malicious .mxd file.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can run any code they want on the target machine.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Potential for unauthorized access to sensitive data on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** Sending a malicious .mxd file as an email attachment.
- **Social Engineering:** Tricking a user into opening a malicious .mxd file via other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft a Malicious .mxd File:** The attacker needs the ability to embed malicious VBA code within a valid .mxd file.
- **Delivery Method:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious .mxd file to a target user. This can be accomplished through email or other social engineering techniques.
- **Target User Action:** The target user must open the malicious .mxd file using a vulnerable version of ESRI ArcGIS.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit-db content includes a proof of concept VBA macro that executes `calc.exe` and opens a web page when the document is opened.
- The content also provides a link to a video demonstration of the exploit.
