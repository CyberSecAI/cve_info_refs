I'm marking this S-s because the bug requires "gc()" although the crash looks like a null-pointer crash. Please triage and remove S-s if appropriate :)

This is another pre-existing issue flushed out by [bug 732744](/show_bug.cgi?id=732744 "RESOLVED FIXED - no need for AutoPreserveEnumerators"). In this case, an error while jaeger-shotting at a loop header pops the frame without jumping to 'error' first.
IIUC, this is on aurora. I'd like to let the fix bake a bit on m-c, though.Whiteboard: js-triage-needed → js-triage-done

So, actually reading the comment this time, Jaeger\_Throwing indicates that the current frame has finished. Thus it is wrong to 'goto error' in general for Jaeger\_Throwing. The general case of exception-thrown-in-jit-code is handled corectly by FindExceptionHandler. It is only the special case of "failure to reserve stack space" in CheckStackAndEnterMethodJit that leaves us in this weird state. Unfortunately, I don't see a better fix than introducing yet another enum return. Let me know if you have any bright ideas Brian.

1) Do we expect this crash to be more pronounced with our GA? Right now there's only a handful of crashes on 13
2) Do you expect that any possible regressions will be apparent over the 11 weeks before release?
Thanks!

1) no

Although MAR files will be signed as part of [bug 699700](/show_bug.cgi?id=699700 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add support for signing and verifying MAR files in libmar and the mar program"), the version of the application is not part of the MAR file itself. This means a legitimately signed but older MAR file can be used to downgrade an install of an application. There are other checks around MAR files - a SHA-512 hash of the MAR is downloaded over SSL and used to verify the MAR file downloaded over http was not tampered with. Circumventing this protection would require compromising the update server's SSL session via either attacking the server and its private key directly, or forging/hijacking a cert that would be trusted for the SSL session.

Are you suggesting that we should fail to apply a MAR if "it's version" is older than the current version? That would require baking in an understanding of version numbers, and although I don't think we've ever actually done it, we avoided this kind of version check in the past (even as part of AUS) because of the possibility that if we "messed up" and accidentally shipped something like "version \*" that we'd never be able to ship another update, because \* is the maximum possible version.
I don't think this needs to be fixed.

I second [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install"). Also, we have checks to prevent us from downloading a malicious mar file so the remote attack is already mitigated. A local evil user process could but that same local evil process can already do things like change the user's prefs (think of homepage), add certificates, change the session restore file, etc. (e.g. anything in the profile and more), and so on. I personally think this is much worse than downgrading to a previous release.

With the service, without this protection, an unprivileged user (e.g. the guest user on a public computer) can downgrade the version of Firefox installed on the computer. Currently, without the service, this is not possible. Obviously, a user without admin rights should not be able to control which versions of what software is installed (in C:\Program Files, for all users) on the system. So, this is a security regression in the service-based installer.

It is a regression as far as this possibility wasn't present before the service though the same can be said for most features that are added. In this instance the downgrading of the app to a previous version of the app is IMO not that detrimental since the app will just update itself to the latest version within 24 hours after downgrading. With the risk mitigation capabilities stated in [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install") I still think that not trying to prevent downgrades since the app will just update itself again within 24 hours after the last update check is acceptable.

Allowing downgrades, even for a short period of time, is not acceptable on a multi-user system that makes distinctions between privileged and unprivileged users. If nothing else, allowing downgrades like this (even for short periods of time) allows one user to roll back security fixes for other users on the same computer. This is not acceptable for any short period of time.
This isn't a problem now (pre-service) because the user that does an upgrade/downgrade must be an administrator, and administrators can do whatever they want.
I do think that bsmedberg's point about the potential downfalls of version checking is valid, and we have to be careful to do this in a way that doesn't cause us to shoot ourselves in the foot.
(FWIW, I brought this up during the initial security review and during the even-earlier security review of the stub installer, and I thought we already had agreement on this issue. It is OK if that agreement is lost. But, this is by no means a new issue, unlike some of the other issues that were brought up this week.)

I don't recall this being brought up in the initial security review and the notes don't reflect this being brought up (I do remember regarding stub installer but that also included the possibility of a MITM attack which makes that case easier and more likely than a compromised local non-privileged user account being compromised).
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Reviews/Firefox10/SilentUpdateOSDialogs>
The possibility of a user of a system (note: the guest account is disabled by default) doing what you suggest to another user is to say the least rather unlikely. I really don't think the additional work to mitigate this along with risk / reward makes this something we should be all that concerned about.
Agreed that the original and ever changing design due to additional security requirements has brought up new issues... that's what happens when new requirements are brought up!

The local (non-privileged) user \*is\* the MITM here. Think about a public computer at a public library. The attacker is an authorized user of the computer.
In email, Robert pointed out that our MAR files are like Microsoft Installer patches (MSP files). Robert said MSPs may be able to be installed by limited users. I do know that \*some\* MSPs can be installed this way, but I believe that those are MSPs that only affect per-user configuration, and not the global configuration of the system. I would like a pointer to more information about limited users being able to install MSPs that actually contain patches to the admin-controlled parts of the system (i.e. MSPs that affect files in C:\Program Files\ and registry settings in HKLM). It is likely that we could use a similar design.
And, to be clear, I think this is a must-fix bug, but I don't think it needs to block the service landing in Nightly. We should have a fix before or in Aurora.

I think not allow silent updates from accounts that are not administrators (most user accounts are administrators) would make the concerns a non issue if this is really only about the service.

Besides this not being brought up during the review... the difference being that one is available remotely and the other is available locally. Similarly, locally booting to a Windows installation device allows a person to do all of the above and more.

I don't have pointers handy but signed MSP's can update existing installs.

I'd like to get the input from the rest of the security team on whether this is a must-fix bug.

Agreed. If this is going to be an issue I am sorely tempted to just not allow updates for non-admin users and instead just notify.

I should also mention that even today, with the same attack, just because an administrator gives their approval for updater.exe to run, to me this doesn't imply that they are giving their approval for the installation on the machine to be downgraded.

Since most if not all of the secteam is on this bug, do you think this is a must fix bug or a Firefox 11 blocker? If so, we will remove the ability to update when you are not an administrator of the system.

Is it reasonable to make a security decision based on the fact that the user is in the Administrators group, when they haven't enabled the administrator role (i.e. when they haven't elevated)? Is there any precedent for this? Windows' security system with UAC is designed to allow users in the Administrators group to be protected/limited to the same extent as limited users, as long as they are not elevated. As far as I understand [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install"), implementing the suggestion in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install") would be counter to this. But, perhaps I do not understand [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install") and Brian wasn't suggesting that we check that the user is in the Administrators group, but that we check something else instead. But, I don't know what we would check.

Yes I meant the user belongs to the administrators group.
You mentioned a thread with a guest user on a public computer being able to downgrade a Firefox installation.
A guest user on a public computer would not belong to this group.
And since they would not belong to this group they could not write an update into an administrative user's app data directory that could apply updates through the service.
I would also appreciate feedback on [Comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install").

This seems to argue that we shouldn't get rid of the UAC dialog at all since we would be making a "security decision". Is that what you are suggesting?

No. I always thought that the rationale for doing this was that the administrator decided (while elevated) to install the product knowing that it would install such a service that acts on his behalf. (In reality, most users won't know about it or understand it, but that is the responsibility that an administrator has.) The key there is that the service is installed when the administrator is elevated.
When the administrator is not elevated, the expectation is that the account functions the same as a limited user's account; that is, there should be nothing that can happen in his account that could not happen in a limited user's account. Checking for Administrators group membership, instead of checking for elevation, goes against this part of the UAC design.
In Linux terms: In Linux, we would never make a trust decision based on the fact that the current user is merely \*listed\* in the sudoers file. Instead, for trusted actions, we require that the user has actually executed the sudo command and elevated himself to root-level privileges. When running a command without sudoing, an administrator expects and relies on the fact that his membership in sudoers doesn't affect the security of the command.

The admin account (since we will only be using the service for admin accounts per [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install") unless we hear otherwise) will have nothing happen in his account that could not happen in a limited user account. The system account that was installed by the admin account (elevated if the system is configured to use UAC and the admin accepted elevation) will perform the update for the admin account that requested the update.

This again seems that you want the user to accept / initiate / <insert favorite term her> (in the case of Windows this would be the UAC prompt) the action before performing the action since you state "we require that the user has actually executed the sudo command and elevated himself to root-level privileges". It still seems that you want to keep the UAC prompt.

From what I understand, that is not true. An account in the administrator group would be able to tell the service (in a way that the service would trust) which MAR file to use for the upgrade/downgrade, but an account that is not in the administrators group would not be able to tell the service (in a way that the service would trust) which upgrade/downgrade to install.

By the way, how would the service know whether or not the user that wrote the MAR file was in the Administrators group? AFAICT, that was the same kind of problem that we couldn't find a solution for w.r.t. the session ID spoofing.
> It still seems that you want to keep the UAC prompt.
Please trust me when I say I do not want to keep the UAC prompt. I feel like I have failed to describe the issue clearly here. Tonight, I will try to find a new way to describe the issue of being elevated vs member of the group that is allowed to elevate.

The system account will be running this and not the admin's (unelevated) account. I guess you are saying that the work item will be written out by the admin account and it will start the service while the work will be done by the system account?

I don't think you "want" to keep the UAC prompt. I do think your examples are representative of keeping the UAC prompt.
can you explain how your example of "we require that the user has actually executed the sudo command and elevated himself to root-level privileges" isn't the same as still displaying the UAC? I am obviously missing your point.

I can think of at least 3 ways:
1) We set administrators only write access to the work item directory.
or
2) We watch directories inside app user data of administrator accounts instead of programdata for work items. Limited user accounts cannot write to those directories by default.
or
3) We only accept MARs that are located in the profile dirs of users that are administrators.
or probably others.

When updater.exe wants to check "what is the currently-installed version," where would it get this information? It is important that it gets it from a place that is updated by every upgrade(/downgrade). (Also, taking into account system restore.)

We have changed the build ID format several times in the past and might change it again in the future so I don't want build ID used so we don't end up locking us in to changing it again in the future. Checking app version should be enough and the only people that could be downgraded would be on a branch where we update to the same version number and not release builds so I am not concerned about that.
We have a very short time until we have to branch and I still want an answer from the secteam regarding [comment #12](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install"). We have had multiple new requirements from the secteam on this project (even after when we told the secteam we needed land) many of which are for mitigating issues that were brought up several months ago and if not updating except in the admin case as we do today resolves the other issues brought up recently and this then I want to know and if it does not I want to know why it doesn't.
I know there are ways we can add this functionality and if you don't understand why I am still concerned and want to know if that is acceptable these changes add even more complexity in an area where we haven't done this previously and are very late breaking whereas we have done checks for admin in the past. At this time we should not be adding code for additional late breaking security issues and if only updating with the service (e.g. bypassing the UAC dialog) only when the user is admin is not acceptable I think we should hold off on this landing until the Firefox 12 release train.

How would requiring a member of the Administrators group to write the work item file work on Windows XP? Wouldn't that effectively require the administrator to log in (with admin privileges), open firefox (with admin privileges), and wait for it to download the MAR file (with admin privileges), then write the workitem file (with admin privileges). Isn't that exactly what happens now on Windows XP?
Even on Vista and 7, making that change effectively means that an administrator has to log in, run firefox, etc., like above on each box. Think about a corporate network--the administrator \*never\* almost never logs into any users' boxes to run Firefox.
So, AFAICT, making that change would severely cripple the feature, regardless of whether it is secure or not. It isn't my call as to whether such crippling is acceptable, but it totally changes the feature.

As far as I understand the proposal, the proposal is "Trust workitem files that are written by users who are members of the administrators group, regardless of whether they were elevated when they did it; not not trust workitem files written by users who are not in the administrators group." My point is that "Trust <any action> by users who are members of the administrators group, regardless of whether they are elevated..." is not, AFAICT, in line with Vista/2008/7's security design. I do not know what, if anything, breaks, when you do not follow that design.

If we were able to safely do the update, regardless of whether the user who wrote the workitem file was a member of the Administrators group, then we would be working with (instead of against) Windows' security architecture.

We wouldn't use the service on XP since we would only be using the service on systems with UAC to remove the UAC.

It will remove the UAC dialog which is the primary reason for this feature.

Should have said: It is actually the only reason for this feature and everything else was just gravy that I wanted to get added. We will try to add these gravy items in the future.

OK. Then, somebody just needs to explain why it is secure to give an administrator extra privileges even when he isn't elevated. AFAICT, that goes against end=user expectations that have been set by Microsoft, at least.

If that is the case then we cannot get rid of the UAC since that would be doing the same thing as giving the administrator (hopefully non administrator accounts in the future) extra privileges when their account is not elevated.

IF we do not do the "a member of administrators wrote the workitem file" test, then we would be treating unelevated administrators equally to non-administrators. So, that would be a non-issue.
Are other issues:
\* Do administrators expect that, after the they install Firefox 11, that it will upgrade itself without their intervention/approval, possibly influenced by untrusted users?
\* Do administrators expect that, after they install Firefox 11, that it will downgrade itself, change channels, or corrupt itself\*, without their intervention/approval, possibly influenced by untrusted users?
I think that we've been thinking since the beginning that the answer to the first answer is "yes". But, we've never considered the second question before, and I think that the answer would be "no."
\* I do not know to what extent we test the updater being given a MAR file for some previous release to do a downgrade. I wouldn't be surprised if it just corrupts the install, but I also wouldn't be surprised if rstrong has already done some magic to support it.

We would just be giving both administrators and non administrators the capability you pointed out in [comment #33](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c33 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install") and thereby we would still have the issue you stated for administrators. On top of that we would also be doing this for non administrators that don't have the expectation to update. Your reply does not negate that fact.

Administrators only expect that someone that can update today will be able to update tomorrow and by only allowing administrators this will still be the case. If it wasn't we would message the change so they could take appropriate steps.

This won't be anymore of a problem than it is today if we go with only allowing administrators to update.

It doesn't corrupt the install. If it is a partial it fails... if it is a complete it succeeds.

An untrusted user could, at least in theory, write a workitem file that contains path to an old/inappropriate MAR file inside another (administrator) user's profile, to have a similar effect. For example, if the administrator logged in and downloaded a MAR file 6 months ago, and the outdated MAR file is still sitting around in their profile.

Of the three options you presented, this seems the most plausible. But, I think it is still wrong because of the reasons I have (tried to have) explained above, regarding treating unelevated administrators specially.

This is the one bbondy are discussing.
I would still like an answer to [comment #36](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install"). Specifically, how is doing this with an administrator that is not elevated go against the end user expectation set by MS and doing this for an administrator that is not elevated and for limited users not going against the end user expectation set by MS. In addition, we can set the policy as to what conditions we limit allowing the update based on our own security evaluations.

Hrm.
The case of multi-user installs of Firefox with differing privilege levels and rogue local access is, I hope we can agree, a subset of our post-XP Windows install base. I would go so far as to call it a small subset. Shipping the service without a resolution to this bug creates a security exposure for that group, though I'd hasten to point out that it is sg:moderate at best. This is a real bug, we should fix it, but it is a bug that is constrained in both scope and impact.
The problem this service sets out to solve, though, is user resistance to applying updates in general because of an operating system feature that we believe, in making updates more onerous and manual, dissuades users from applying them regularly. The degree of that dissuasion is hard to measure, but what we can say is that it applies to all of our post-XP windows install (modulo those who disable UAC). What's worse, under the current update regime, unprivileged users in this differing-privilege cohort don't get to apply updates at all (they get a notice so they can escalate/inform).
To my mind, both "inability to apply updates while unprivileged" and "less willing to apply updates while privileged" are graver security risks for our users than the downgrade attack represented here. My preference, and the motivation behind this work, would be to address this update lag as soon as humanly possible because it represents a massive attack surface for users at all privilege levels and we have good data pointing to this lag in the field (albeit while speculating about its causes).
Am I off-base in my assessment here? I think we are burning-hot-on-fire-with-flames in terms of putting our users at risk by requiring their active participation in our delivery of updates. My sense is that the path of righteousness is to douse that fire by shipping the service, and then resolve this important and valid bug. Not because of an artificial timeline we've imposed on ourselves, but because I believe we are putting our users at continued risk by not shipping it.

I think that you are mostly right Johnathan. But, I think the same things apply to XP users too--in fact, they are even more affected than Vista/7 users, because UAC is actually \*MUCH\* less inconvenient than what XP users have to do to install an update. The nice thing about fixing this bug and the related ones is that the automatic, silent updates will work for all users on all versions of Windows. AFAICT, that is what we are going to have to do anyway.
The bad thing about doing the workaround that rstrong and bbondy are proposing is that, we will have to rip it out and fix these bugs later anyway. That means churn in the feature after we've started shipping it to users, which means more risk that we are going to break things and/or paint ourselves into a corner for solving the problem more appropriately later. Also, we don't even know the design of that workaround yet, so we cannot even evaluate its security. And, finally, the workaround greatly restricts the effectiveness of the feature compared with fixing these bugs.

Because, an unevaluated admin is being treated like a limited user. That is the main expectation that makes it reasonable to use your computer to do everyday tasks with an account that is in the Administrators group.
Imagine that we designed things a different way, so that the service just downloaded the MAR file itself. Under what conditions could we automatically install the MAR file? We could do so as long as it is the same product, same channel, and later version. Now, what difference does it really make that some user (admin or otherwise) downloaded the file instead of us? My position is that there is no difference (and should be no difference); they are just playing the part of an untrusted network proxy, so that we don't have to write networking code driven by the service.
(Hopefully that clarifies things more than it confuses things.)

We have already had a metric ton of churn in this last week. What we are proposing is very simple to accomplish when compared to that churn. Also, the churn in the last week is significantly more likely to break users than what we are proposing. We have already considered whether it would paint us into a corner and actually fixing this bug would be much more likely to paint us into a corner due to the extra restrictions that have been repeatedly noted.

So, the unevaluated admin (do you mean unelevated and if not please provide more details) should not be allowed to apply an update without displaying the UAC and the limited user shouldn't be allowed to apply updates? Or are you saying that the admin user could downgrade and we need to protect against that? If so, the admin user can already downgrade.

This doesn't apply since we are proposing only allowing an admin or as Johnathan commented not worrying about this bug for the current release. See [comment #28](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c28 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install") as to why these are the choices at this time.

He \*can\* but we should not forget that he might not want to do that but something else on running under his account wants so without him noticing. I'm not saying this is critical but malware should not be able to abuse our service for this or any other purpose that helps it to circumvent the UAC.

Just to make that clear, as my post might have been misleading: I'm not saying that the malware attack is an issue at all for this particular bug (version downgrade), because malware wouldn't benefit that much from downgrading it (exploiting a bug in downgraded Firefox wouldn't elevate privileges), it was rather an example to show that whether the user can do it with or without UAC is something we shouldn't threat equally in general. But I assume you we're not suggesting that and rather only referring to the version downgrade specifically.

Right.
But, all types of users should equally be allowed to submit a MAR file to the service so that the service can apply the updates if the update meet reasonable criteria for automatically, silently, doing the update.
> Or are
> you saying that the admin user could downgrade and we need to protect
> against that? If so, the admin user can already downgrade.
I am saying that the service shouldn't automate downgrading and that downgrading must require explicit administrator intervention. (And, same with channel switching.)

It seems like only allowing an admin to do this is going to reduce attack surface, so that is better than just doing nothing. I hope that people that would make the decision to do that understand that this (a) severely limits the effectiveness of the feature, and (b) is counter to the fundamental design of Windows' UAC mechanism. If there is anything I can do to clarify this for people that don't understand what I am trying to say, I will try harder to clarify it.
We don't have any concrete proposal for restricting the submission of workitems such that only administrators can submit them. If we are going to do something like that (which I am still totally against), please at least share the details so that I can help analyze the security of that workaround. Even though I completely disagree with doing anything like that, I still want to help ensure that whatever you do is as good as possible.

How does that work specifically? The version isn't in the MAR or we'd close this bug INVALID/WORKSFORME. There's a "update.version" text file that sits next to the .MAR but that's not signed and unreliable in the attack scenario.

That's fine with me and that's what I did originally in [Comment 51](/show_bug.cgi?id=708688#c51 "VERIFIED FIXED - Signed MAR files are not version checked and can be used to downgrade an install"), but I was emailed by bsmith to change it.

I don't mind either way but just wanted to show the justification for why it was changed.

I'm not sure if these are correct, but it seems like we could be missing UnmarkGray calls in a few places.

[fix mPrototypeNoHelper](attachment.cgi?id=586560&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=586560&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=716067&attachment=586560)

The concern here is that someone could cause get a reference to a scope's mPrototypeNoHelper. Then it could stash the reference in a DOM object or something and relinquish all other references, cause the mPrototypeNoHelper object to be marked gray. Later, they could cause an object to be created with mPrototypeNoHelper as its proto. This would lead to a black -> gray pointer (via the proto edge), which violates our invariants.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=716067&attachment=586568)

This patch is questionable. In theory, if a tear-off JS object could become gray while the XPC wrapped native's JS object was black, then the tear-off's JS object could be exposed to JS code via DefinePropertyIfFound's to->GetJSObject() call.
However, as far as I can tell from the code, once a tear-off's JS object has been created, it always has a strong reference from the wrapped native's flattened object (via property that it set during the resolve hook). However, if that's true, then I don't understand the purpose of all this tear-off sweeping code. Why don't we just keep the tear-offs alive as long as the WrappedNative is alive?

Same story. It seems like we could add a waiver wrapper to the map, then it could end up gray if it's stored in a DOM object, and then we could look it up in the map again and return it to JS code.
However, I have no idea what a waiver wrapper is, so I may be wrong.

> Is this something we ought to take on Firefox 12 or ESR?
We now know that there are a lot more bugs like this. As far as we know, they'll only lead to a NULL pointer crash. However, we've never connected one of these bugs to an actual crash, so it's all pretty theoretical. I don't think there's much reason to take this on branches.

Critical: firefox security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0710)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2011-3101, CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939,
CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
Firefox no longer blocked Firefox inline event handlers. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to possibly bypass a web application's intended
restrictions, if that application relied on CSP to protect against flaws
such as cross-site scripting (XSS). (CVE-2012-1944)

If a web server hosted HTML files that are stored on a Microsoft Windows
share, or a Samba share, loading such files with Firefox could result in
Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
HTML files from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.5 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ken Russell of Google as the original reporter of
CVE-2011-3101; Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman
as the original reporters of CVE-2012-1937; Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov,
Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy as the
original reporters of CVE-2012-1938; Christian Holler as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-1939; security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google as
the original reporter of CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, and CVE-2012-1947;
security researcher Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1946; security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1944; and security researcher Paul Stone as the original reporter
of CVE-2012-1945.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

UnmarkGrayChildren, <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/xpconnect/src/nsXPConnect.cpp#609> , recursively calls JS\_TraceChildren to unmark the gray objects. However, this is not safe if the background finalization thread is running.
The problem comes from the usage of the conservative marking calls like MarkStackRangeConservatively, <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/jsiter.cpp#1139> , when navigating the object graph under JS\_TraceChildren. As that call checks an address against the GC chunk table and other GC data structures to verify for live GC things it is important that the those data structures are not freed.
However, with the background finalization thread running this is violated. For example, it is possible that the background thread manages to finalize and release the GC chunk for GC thing that MarkStackRangeConservatively just finds and tries to mark. After that the memory range corresponding to the chunk can be allocated and filled from other threads. Then the GC graph traversal may call a function through a pointer stored in that filled memory.

A similar problem can also happen if another thread allocates objects. Then the conservative scanner under UnmarkGrayChildren may observe partially objects when they still contains data from older allocations. But if we do not allow/support running JS on non-main thread that uses the main JS runtime this may not be applicable to the browser.Summary: UnmarkGrayChildren unsafe in presence of the background finalization thread → UnmarkGrayChildren is unsafe in presence of the background finalization thread

In Fx10 we think all JS threads run on separate runtimes which would make this a non-issue, but in Fx9 we know at least PSM ran multiple JS threads on the same runtime. Can we let this ride until Jan 31 (when Fx10 is scheduled to ship). We don't even have a testcase showing it's possible to line up the necessary conditions to trigger the bug.Whiteboard: [sg:moderate]

Not sure if this is applicable in the browser on trunk any more since I do not think we're ever running JS on different threads, but this could be exploitable in Firefox 8 and 9. Assigning to Andrew in case there's any work that's already happening that we could backport, or if there's an easy branch patch that we could take in the older releases.Assignee: nobody → continuation

The situation Igor describes in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=699594#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - UnmarkGrayChildren is unsafe in presence of the background finalization thread") comes up even with single-threaded JS, because we still do finalization on another thread.
It looks like the only place JS\_TraceChildren may call MarkStackRangeConservatively is in when we're tracing a generator? [1] The other call sites look like various stack tracing things, which I wouldn't think would be affected. Can we use a lock or a flag or something to indicate to the finalization thread that we're currently looking at a particular chunk?

Yeah, I think we should just remove conservative stack scanning from jsiter.cpp. And we should also take it out of the JS stack scanning for good measure.
Brian, how difficult is this? David said he's pretty sure that since TI we sync the JS stack at all times. I guess that doesn't help for FF8, though.

With TI we ensure that there is a fully synced interpreter stack when calling into the VM, except that local variables which are dead at the call site may have a torn value (there are a couple other places that want to see handling for this, though).
If the frame being traced is a generator frame, is it even possible that the frame could have been running in JM? JM does not compile scripts containing JSOP\_GENERATOR. If a frame has only run in the interpreter, its contents should definitely be synced up to the current stack position, in any version of Firefox.

There is still the situation where jit code calls a generator with overflow args and the non-canonical args slots are left in an undefined state. That's what <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/c60535115ea1/js/src/vm/Stack.cpp#l139> is trying to catch. If you changed the Debug\_SetValueRangeToCrashOnTouch to MakeValueRangeGCSafe I think you could remove the conservative marking in generator\_trace.

It would be nice if we use the conservative scanner only when checking the native stack roots. Besides fixing this bug it would also simplify a couple of other my patches :)

I'm going to unassign myself from this bug, as it sounds like the path forward is to remove the uses of MarkStackRangeConservatively from JS\_TraceChildren, which occur entirely within MarkGenerator in jsiter.cpp.Assignee: continuation → nobody

The following command crashes on mozilla-central revision 13b571bde26a:

At first glance it looks like some pointer arithmetic magic going wrong in jsobj.h (NULL pointer, likely from OOM is added to elements size to form a new pointer that is freed).
If the size is controllable (and I assume it will be somehow), then this is exploitable if the attacker can force OOM for the script in the right moment.

Forgot that the shell.js is a file I created. Just omit the shell.js file and use -A 355, will also reproduce the bug.

I wrote a patch for the JS shell that will output the trace when -A steps in (as in, when js\_malloc and friends return NULL due to -A, then a backtrace will be emitted immediately). I hope this helps to track down the faulty code location that does not properly handle the OOM.
Here's the first trace for this test:

The crashing line of JSObject::makeDenseArraySlow is part of OOM recovery code that bhackett rewrote in [bug 693221](/show_bug.cgi?id=693221 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove JSObject::capacity and JSObject::initializedLength"):

I do have a fix for this that I'll post later when I'm home. not sure if it's correct of course.

I'm feeling lucky, so I created a patch that I think fixes the problem :D
Only call free when | elements | was actually set in | allocateSlowArrayElements |. If the ObjectElement allocation there fails and we return false, then elements remains unchanged and must not be freed.

From the patch it looks like this is always going to try freeing emptyObjectHeader. Can an attacker influence what's there in a useful way? This should affect the ESR branch so we need to decide if this is a vulnerability that needs to be fixed there.

Thanks for verifying this. However, for tests that use -A, simply running the command for verification on the new revision is not sufficient. The reason is that the -A parameter is the number of internal memory allocations done by the code before an out-of-memory condition is simulated. Thus, this value can easily change on a newer revision and the only way to verify the fix is to retest with a whole range (best, all), possible -A values.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=827829#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-06-03 08:28:23 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.  Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-34.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=827829#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-05 20:59:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0710 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0710.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=827829#c3)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-06 04:13:14 UTC  ``` This came through as well; adding it here due to the relation to CVE-2011-3101:  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2012-3105](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3105) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2012-3105](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3105) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3105> Assigned: 20120605 Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-34.html> Reference: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744888>  The glBufferData function in the WebGL implementation in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 12.0, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.5, Thunderbird 5.0 through 12.0, Thunderbird ESR 10.x before 10.0.5, and SeaMonkey before 2.10 does not properly mitigate an unspecified flaw in an NVIDIA driver, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors, a related issue to [CVE-2011-3101](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3101).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=827829#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-06 23:51:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0715 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0715.html>   ``` |  |

|  | |

This is another instance of the "use after unlink" problem described in [bug 690970](/show_bug.cgi?id=690970 "RESOLVED FIXED - cycle collector can be made to Unlink live objects (by using weak maps or watchpoints)"), where a black-gray edge can cause the cycle collector to think something is dead when it is alive, and call Unlink on it. This probably only can causes null derefs, but Unlink functions are written by hand in C++, so who knows.
A shape can hold onto a non-shape, but UnmarkGrayChildren stops if it reaches a shape. Thus there can be an edge from a black object to a gray shape.
We can't just remove this check, because it may cause the stack limit to be hit more often, which will trigger GCs more often. Instead, we need to use JS\_TraceShapeCycleCollectorChildren.

|  | |

This is a little weird because JS\_TraceShapeCycleCollectorChildren won't actually unmarkgray the shape or base shapes it encounters, because it doesn't visit them.
Of course, the CC never actually sees these objects, and because they are left gray not black it won't skip through them. So it seems technically okay, because the CC graph will never contain black-gray edges.
It still seems bad, because any sort of black-gray detection that looks at the GC's view of the heap and not the CC's will be confused. Maybe I'll make a variation of it or something. Either that or write another JS tracer that traces through and marks shapes and base shapes, but nothing else...

This code is a little tricky.
I seem to consistently get shutdown leaks. I should figure out what that's about.

I think it could be cleaner and easier to understand if each JS\_TraceChildren call uses its own fresh UnmarkGrayTracer.

Yeah, that's a good point.
The leaks appear to be occurring because mScopeObjects are black, and rooting everything. I'm not really sure what they are:
0x1185c5ba0 B mScopeObject
I also see black objects intermixed with gray objects in the roots, which is a little disturbing. I'm not sure if that's an artifact of the heap dumping process or what. I should see how things are without my patch...

0x11a1ce380 G mJSGetterObject
0x11a1ce3c0 G mJSGetterObject
0x11a1ce400 G mJSSetterObject
I also seem to get some longish ForgetSkippable times, but I don't know if that's due to doing a lot more unmarkgray or because I'm using a debug build:
CC(T+356.9) duration: 45ms, suspected: 2721, visited: 12993 RCed and 9683 GCed, collected: 8775 RCed and 458 GCed (9233 waiting for GC)

Okay, I get shutdown leaks even without my patches. That's a little disturbing.

The forget skippable times from my light testing don't look much worse than what I'm seeing in the bad cases on an unpatched build I've been running for a few days, so I guess it is probably okay.

It turns out that it is just this particular profile of mine that has shutdown leaks. That's a little disturbing. I guess I'll file a separate bug for that.

It looks much nicer with the extra tracer rather than manually saving and restoring the state. I do worry a bit about the extra 7 words per stack frame for the tracer, but perhaps that is a premature concern. If it ends up being a problem (we can track via telemetry), we could have some kind of TracerState that is just the two words, and swap that out instead of saving and restoring the individual parts.

I think you can simplify the last loop even more, like this:
UnmarkGrayTracer childTracer(tracer, true);
do {
JS\_TraceChildren(&childTracer, thing, JSTRACE\_SHAPE);
thing = childTracer.mPreviousShape;
} while (thing);
The child tracer will take care of doing UnmarkGray, and it won't fill in mPreviousShape if it was already gray.

Oh, yeah, you're right. But you could move the declaration of childTracer into the loop to take care of that.

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes three new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to 10.0.5ESR fixing various
bugs and security issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-34 Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey,
Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox 12.(CVE-2012-1938)
Christian Holler reported a memory safety problem
that affects Firefox ESR. (CVE-2012-1939)
Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse
Ruderman reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR and Firefox 13. (CVE-2012-1937)
Ken Russell of Google reported a bug in NVIDIA
graphics drivers that they needed to work around in the
Chromium WebGL implementation. Mozilla has done the same in
Firefox 13 and ESR 10.0.5. (CVE-2011-3101)
\*
MFSA 2012-35 Security researcher James Forshaw of
Context Information Security found two issues with the
Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater service introduced
in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows Mozilla's
updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context.
The updater can be called by the Updater Service or
independently on systems that do not use the service. The
second of these issues allows for the updater service to
load an arbitrary local DLL file, which can then be run
with the same system privileges used by the service. Both
of these issues require local file system access to be
exploitable.
Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service
(CVE-2012-1942) Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from
application directory (CVE-2012-1943)
\*
MFSA 2012-36 Security researcher Adam Barth found
that inline event handlers, such as onclick, were no longer
blocked by Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script
blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature
of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were
not fully protected. (CVE-2012-1944)
\*
MFSA 2012-37 Security researcher Paul Stone reported
an attack where an HTML page hosted on a Windows share and
then loaded could then load Windows shortcut files (.lnk)
in the same share. These shortcut files could then link to
arbitrary locations on the local file system of the
individual loading the HTML page. That page could show the
contents of these linked files or directories from the
local file system in an iframe, causing information
disclosure.
This issue could potentially affect Linux machines
with samba shares enabled. (CVE-2012-1945)
\*
MFSA 2012-38 Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find a use-after-free while
replacing/inserting a node in a document. This
use-after-free could possibly allow for remote code
execution. (CVE-2012-1946)
\*
MFSA 2012-39 Security researcher Kaspar Brand found a
flaw in how the Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1
decoder handles zero length items. Effects of this issue
depend on the field. One known symptom is an unexploitable
crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles
zero-length basic constraints, assuming default values for
some types that should be rejected as malformed. These
issues have been addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now
being used by Mozilla. (CVE-2012-0441)
\*
MFSA 2012-40 Security researcher Abhishek Arya of
Google used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover several
issues: two heap buffer overflow bugs and a use-after-free
problem. The first heap buffer overflow was found in
conversion from unicode to native character sets when the
function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList
when working with column layout with absolute positioning
in a container that changes size. The second buffer
overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState when a window is
resized on a page with nested columns and a combination of
absolute and relative positioning. All three of these
issues are potentially exploitable.
Heap-buffer-overflow in utf16\_to\_isolatin1
(CVE-2012-1947) Heap-use-after-free in
nsFrameList::FirstChild (CVE-2012-1940)
Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLReflowState::CalculateHypotheticalBox, with nested
multi-column, relative position, and absolute position
(CVE-2012-1941)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3101,
CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939, CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941,
CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
Thunderbird no longer blocked Thunderbird inline event handlers. Malicious
content could possibly bypass intended restrictions if that content relied
on CSP to protect against flaws such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
(CVE-2012-1944)

If a web server hosted content that is stored on a Microsoft Windows share,
or a Samba share, loading such content with Thunderbird could result in
Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
content from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ken Russell of Google as the original reporter of
CVE-2011-3101; Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman
as the original reporters of CVE-2012-1937; Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov,
Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy as the
original reporters of CVE-2012-1938; Christian Holler as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-1939; security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google as
the original reporter of CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, and CVE-2012-1947;
security researcher Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1946; security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1944; and security researcher Paul Stone as the original reporter
of CVE-2012-1945.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Re 1: I'm pretty sure that file locking is honored even with UNC paths. I'll verify this once I get back from the Firefox work week though.
Re 2: What would you recommend here? Since we're loading as a resource dll only now I'm not sure which attack you are worried about here.

For 1) It is honored in the sense that the local file system/OS will honor it if you open through the API, but there is no guarantee that the system you connected to will do the same. For example if the share in on a Linux box there is no reason the attacker couldn't change the file data. And while the cache manager should have some of the file data in memory it gives you no assurances on what it will return you next time from a remote service.
For 2) the attack would be that you could place the magic string resource in the .DLL form of the file, but you actually use the non DLL version as the canonical updater. This effectively makes what ever check you are supposed to be doing moot. I assume the check is there to tie say only special updaters as opposed to any binaries signed my the mozilla private key. Whether than ultimately leads to any EoP condition depends on what happens next. Of course if it doesn't lead to EoP then why do it in the first place?

Re 1: I think we could add a check to ensure the path is not a mapped drive nor UNC path if that is necessary.

Re 1: but there are ways and means, for example everything is a mapped drive in WinNT effectively, and you couldn't exclude a USB drive for example just because it might be mapped per-user rather than per-machine. It is possible to confuse the Win32 API that a drive letter is not really really a network share.
Re 2: Sure, but if that is the case what is the issue the initial check protects against? If it is to stop you using any mozilla signed binaries which are "not" the updater then this fix does not prevent that. I can assume that the fix is because you do not necessarily trust just anything moz signed as a valid updater?

James I spoke with Rob Strong about this and we think we have a viable solution in addition to the attached patch.
If the path passed is on an NTFS drive we will use the service for the update.
If the path passed is not on an NTFS drive, we will not even attempt to use the service for the update.
The service will also do this check and fail to apply the update if it finds the path is not on an NTFS drive. If it is an NTFS drive then it supports file locking.
Please let us know what you think.

As discussed, if we have NTFS then we will use the service, otherwise we will not use the service.
I did verify and disallowing sharing on a file in FAT32 works in the same way as NTFS in XP.
So we could:
- Leave it as is and only use in NTFS
- Change it to accept NTFS and FAT32
- Change it to a different check to check if it is a fixed drive (DRIVE\_FIXED) from a call to GetDriveType

By the way the user profile dir is usually on the primary volume which is always NTFS on Vista and up. So that's why I am OK with excluding non NTFS volumes. In those cases the user would get a UAC prompt instead.

Sounds a good idea.
The only thing I could suggest would be to ensure you copy the update contents to a known good location somewhere which cannot be changed by the user before doing any checks. That way it doesn't much matter if they can break the lock through some remote share trick. However even that has risks, such as if you fail in deleting the content then you have copied a potentially dangerous executable to a "secure" location, some times the OS will trust it more if as a user you could not have written the file. Plus I can imagine it would be a fair amount of extra work for a fairly difficult edge case.

Thanks for the feedback.
I think making it more complex at this point would do more harm than good. Locking the file on a file system we know supports it is good and cannot be exploited to my knowledge.

Looking at the patch, only thing I could suggest would be to ensure you are checking the return from PathStripToRoot (just because I am paranoid, might as well always check a return code, it should return an empty string if no root info, but well...). And I guess there is the even more slight edge case of symlinks.
Thankfully MS in their wisdom made symlinks require admin rights (well you could enable them for normal users). But they \_could\_ in theory point it to a network share. If you strip to root then it will think it is ntfs.
It seems that GetVolumeInformation will actually take a full path and return the correct response even in the symlink case, but I don't know if I would want to rely on that behaviour :)

Patch with NTFS check.
I'm ok with some or all of the following being done in a followup bug:
1. flag the update to not use the service upon download.
2. the service shouldn't be installed or updated for this install. That would mean not showing the option in the installer as well.
3. the option to use the service should not be displayed in the preferences ui.
4. might be other cases.
Make sense?

Good ideas. After thinking about them more though I think only #3 should be done (and #4 if we think of new things).
> 1. flag the update to not use the service upon download.
This one does not need to be done because even know the update is marked as pending-service, the service will simply not be used when we do the check in the unelevated updater before any update is attempted. We do the same type of thing if we happen to notice that we already have write access in the unelevated updater. Instead of launching the service command we just relaunch ourselves as an elevated process.
> 2. the service shouldn't be installed or updated for this install.
> That would mean not showing the option in the installer as well.
I think we should not do this one because we will use the service for prefetch clearing once that lands, and there may be future use cases for the service.
> 3. the option to use the service should not be displayed in the preferences ui.
Yup, I'll post a follow up for it as you suggested.
> 4. might be other cases
Can't think of any off hand but I CC'ed Simona who may think of extra things.

GetVolumeInformationW will fail if that call fails so it is already covered.

The other security checks will fail in that case so I don't think it needs to be checked.

I tested this on a Vista machine where I set the OS profile dir to be on a FAT32 volume but the installation dir on NTFS volume and it works. I also tested this on the same machine with the OS profile dir on an NTFS volume.
I do think ACL's are part of the filesystem but I think file locking is not directly part of the filesystem. That being said I am not confident that this is the best fix. I kind of prefer my original fix that doesn't even consider NTFS. It just locks the file for write access.

In addition to [Comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=748948#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible race condition when launching updates from service after security checks")...
I just tested with a samba share to a Ubuntu ext4 drive, and file locking works there too.
I recommend we go with the original patch and I'm re-requesting review for that one.
Sorry for the time waste on reviewing the second patch but I feel more comfortable catching it late then just going with the flow when I think it is wrong.
The only possible attack metric here is if the user was in control of both computers, the Ubuntu computer can modify the file while it is locked.
I don't think the extra code complexity here is worth it though.
It also requires the OS' user profile dir to be on that same share.

what's the basis of this restriction ? above you had said that the profile dir could be on a FAT32 volume and the installation dir on another volume, why do they need to be colocated in the remote case ? the attack here is the attacker can specify a server they control and then choose to not honor the file locking and exploit the race - if the profile also has to be on that attacker controller server, there are many other security issues, i would think.
what about the 'copy the update to a local location that can definitely be locked' approach suggested in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=748948#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible race condition when launching updates from service after security checks") ?

I just meant that by default the updates get applied to the user profile directory, but I guess someone could pass commands to the service arbitrarily.

The attack I mentioned cannot be exploited from a user on the local windows computer. They have to somehow signal to the other computer to start a process to modify the file at the exact instant. If the user from the local computer tried to modify the file, even if they had write access they would get a sharing violation error.
If we can't trust file sharing in Windows then I think that we have issues elsewhere as well.

If the above isn't acceptable I'd rather go back to the NTFS approach which will cover the case of remote shares. Copying the file to another location and requiring it to be deleted opens up a lot of other failure conditions that we'd have to test for and I'd rather avoid that.

Another thing we could do is instead of checking the filesystem type which doesn't matter and using that to mean local or remote, we could just use GetDriveType checking for DRIVE\_FIXED.

yes, and an externally reported attack, at that.
i'm fine with landing the NTFS patch. DRIVE\_FIXED also looks like that will mitigate this also if you prefer that approach - it perhaps is slightly better in terms of not having to be so strict about filesystem type.

Considering the number of users using shares is extremely likely to be relatively small not using the service for them seems like the best path forward especially if DRIVE\_FIXED is used.

I was asked to chime in...
tl;dr: It seems OK/good to do the DRIVE\_FIXED check but it isn't clear that it completely solves the problem, though it probably does. We should follow up with implementing the suggestion in [bug 748948 comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=748948#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible race condition when launching updates from service after security checks") unless we can find that DRIVE\_FIXED is specified to guarantee that locking will be honored.
I think that the DRIVE\_FIXED check is good because then there is less of a chance of multiple clients trying to update the same network-share-installed copy of Firefox. The network share system itself should be running the update service, or else the network admin probably doesn't want anybody to try to update the shared copy.
However, I am not so confident that the DRIVE\_FIXED check is sufficient. Is there some documentation that says that file access modes are always honored for DRIVE\_FIXED? I get nervous about relying on things that are only determined to be true experimentally, because we may be relying on assumptions that are not necessarily true now or which could become wrong in the future.
I agree with the people who said that that writing the updater to the install folder is the most obviously-correct fix. If an attacker can write to the install folder then it is already game-over. If we do anything less then that, then how will we be confident that the fix works in all situations? IMO, we should at least file a follow-up bug for doing that.
It is good news that the install drive will usually be NTFS on Vista+, but it would be good to have the service working for as many people as possible, including on Windows XP, which means supporting . So, I agree with the decision to remove the NTFS check.

Thanks for chiming in.
I don't think that there is a case where file locking is not respected when the drive is DRIVE\_FIXED but I would welcome a bug to work on that presented a counter example.

> obviously-correct fix.
I don't agree. In addition to my previous comments, here is my more sound reasoning:
The installation directory is not guaranteed to be in a secure location. We often install into the user's app data which is not secure. If we allow the exe to run in the installation directory that means we allow it to run an exe that could be in an insecure location.
You could say that it's the user's fault for installing into an insecure location, but the harmful effects are greater than them messing up firefox. They can escalate their limited user account to the system account and indirectly to executing code in any logged in session.
Even if we forced users to install into program files, I know that some users have already set write access into our installation directory. Forcing users into program files would surely have some consequences and we'd leave a long tail of users in an insecure state if we did it. We could try to find some other directory that we don't own or create such a secure directory to run the executable from but this seems like overkill and leaves room for more holes and problems.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=748948&attachment=620164)

Carrying forward r+.
I added in a strict check to make sure restricting file sharing succeeds as per bent's suggestion. This is important since the security depends on us obtaining a file handle that specifies not to share write access. For example the call could have failed if someone tried an attack that opens the file with write access already.

In addition FAT32 lacks ACLs, whereas the fs type doesn't seem to matter with file open sharing restricted.

> I don't agree. In addition to my previous comments...
I would argue that it isn't the firefox installation directory to which you should be writing, it is the maintenance service's directory. After all if you can already write to that directory then you can replace the service binary and gain system anyway.
That said see bug [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=750850](/show_bug.cgi?id=750850 "VERIFIED FIXED - Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from application directory") which I filed yesterday to understand why even that isn't going to be a good idea necessarily :)
It does worry me somewhat that the level of complexity required to do the "right thing" seems to be spiraling out of control somewhat.

It has been my experience that doing the "right thing" typically does spiral out of control when trying to prevent attack vectors that require local system access though we do try to protect against them at least for the normal use case and often for edge cases as well.

I would add to [Comment 34](/show_bug.cgi?id=748948#c34 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible race condition when launching updates from service after security checks") that this is equivalent to running an elevated process in general. Since you can simply call CreateService followed by StartService to run any code as the local system account.
Even more horrible in Windows is that if you are either an elevated administrator or the system account (equivalent because of the above), you can run code from any user account that is logged in by simply walking the process list and using any token, then getting the linked elevated token to that token, then calling CreateProcessAsUser with that token.

Tested this GetDriveType / share lock fix by forcing the profile dir to be on a remote drive. It falls back to UAC without trying the service. Also tested normal updates via elm and they are working. Will land shortly.

This was basically a mistake over the meaning of some arguments to the Lifetime constructor, I think. The fix is simple.
Most of the work of writing this patch was in figuring out the meaning of the savedEnd field, so I tried to improve the comment describing it. Let me know if you have any ideas for this.
I don't understand precisely how the JIT uses this information, so I decided to be conservative and close the bug.

regression from [bug 714645](/show_bug.cgi?id=714645 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ js::HeapPtr<js::Shape, unsigned long>::operator]") which landed in Firefox 12 so we don't have to worry about ESR.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-34

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:13.0/ rv:10.0.5)

Announced
June 5, 2012
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 13
* Firefox ESR 10.0.5
* SeaMonkey 2.10
* Thunderbird 13
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.5

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk
in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

### References

Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox 12.

JavaScript error: , line 0: Permission denied for <file://> to call method XULElement.QueryInterface
###!!! ASSERTION: JS failed without setting an exception!: 'JS\_IsExceptionPending(cx)', file js/src/xpconnect/src/xpcwrappedjsclass.cpp, line 323
Security-sensitive because there seems to be some context or privilege confusion. Did a the file: URL really get its hands on a XULElement?

We end up with that JS error because nsHTMLLegendElement::Focus calls nsFocusManager::MoveFocus which calls nsFocusManager::DetermineElementToMoveFocus which tries to get the next tabbable content, which ends up calling nsXULElement::IsFocusable on a <xul:textbox>. This is presumably happening because MoveFocus is used by the legend element to move focus to the next thing in tab order, but there's nothing else in the content document in tab order, so we end up trying to move the focus to chrome. This is probably buggy; enn, is there a way to restrict the focus move to the content document?
That said, it's odd that trying to call back out through XPConnect there does a security check...

Should be fairly easy to add. Just implement an extra bitflag passed to MoveFocus. Then when set, DetermineElementToMoveFocus would need to return early here:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/nsFocusManager.cpp#2517>
(before where it says 'Traverse up to the parent document')
I assume you still want to traverse down into subframes, but this will stop traversal up and to siblings.

There is in fact a security check: does that save us enough or do you think there's still a potential security problem here.
Neil: would such a check interfere with tabbing around a multi-frame document, or just automatic focus moves as in this legend case?

The intent would be that the flag would only be supplied by the call from nsHTMLLegendElement::Focus.

We should be able to do without fixing this on the ESR because the existing security check does prevent bad things happening.
