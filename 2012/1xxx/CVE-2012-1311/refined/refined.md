Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) feature of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE software when used on a device configured with VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) instances.
- The core issue is related to how RSVP packets are handled when VRF instances are configured, specifically when RSVP is enabled on some interfaces but not all within a VRF environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Interface Queue Wedge:** The vulnerability leads to a "queue wedge" on the receiving interface processing RSVP. This means that packets get queued but are not processed, effectively blocking the interface.
- **Improper Handling of RSVP Packets:** The software fails to properly handle RSVP packets when some interfaces within a VRF environment have RSVP enabled, and others do not. This can occur when a VRF is configured without RSVP, while another interface (physical or virtual) outside that VRF is configured with RSVP.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There is a lack of proper validation or handling of RSVP packets received on interfaces with the described VRF configuration, causing the queue wedge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in an interface wedge, leading to:
  - Loss of connectivity.
  - Loss of routing protocol adjacencies.
  - Other DoS conditions.
- **Extended DoS:** The vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition, requiring a device reload to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- **RSVP Packet Injection:** The attacker sends RSVP packets to vulnerable devices with specific configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target device.
- **Knowledge of Target Infrastructure:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the target network infrastructure to understand if the device is vulnerable based on its VRF and RSVP configurations and to craft appropriate RSVP packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Configurations:** The vulnerability affects devices configured with:
    - At least one VRF configured without RSVP
    - At least one other interface (physical or virtual), not in the same VRF, configured with RSVP
- **Example Scenarios:**
    - RSVP-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) in MPLS infrastructures
    - Multi-VRF infrastructures
    - VRF-Lite infrastructures
- **Workaround:** The command **ip rsvp listener vrf** *vrf-name ip-address* **0 0 announce**, where the IP address is one that does not exist on the device or in the routing tables.
- **CVSS Metrics:**
    - Base Score: 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
    - Temporal Score: 6.4 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)
- **Exploitability:** Functional exploit code is available (E:F).
- **Remediation:** An official fix is available (RL:OF).
- **Report Confidence:** The vulnerability has been confirmed (RC:C).
