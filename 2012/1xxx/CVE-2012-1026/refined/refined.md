The content is related to CVE-2012-1026.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application `XRayCMS` is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the username and password parameters from the login form are passed directly into a query without any escaping or sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The vulnerability exists in the `login2.php` file, specifically at lines 20 and 21, where the `username` and `password` parameters from the POST request are directly assigned to PHP variables without proper sanitization.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful SQL injection can lead to authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to log in as an administrator or gain access to sensitive data by manipulating database queries. In this case, the exploit allows an attacker to log into the admin account by inserting `' or 1=1#` into the username field, causing the authentication check to evaluate to true.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web application login form. The attacker sends a crafted username parameter containing SQL injection payload to the `login2.php` page through an HTTP POST request.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application and be able to access the login page. No prior authentication is required.
