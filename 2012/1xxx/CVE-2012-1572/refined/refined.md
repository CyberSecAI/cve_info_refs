  "baseScore": "7.5",
  "impactScore": "5.9",
  "exploitabilityScore": "10.0",
  "report": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in how OpenStack Keystone handles password validation. When validating a password, glibc allocates space on the stack for the entire password. If the password is excessively long, it can lead to stack exhaustion.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack exhaustion due to unbounded memory allocation on stack for long passwords."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash in Keystone by submitting an extremely long password when attempting to log into an existing account, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to know a valid account name and send an extremely long password to trigger the vulnerability.",
