### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=805551#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-21 15:02:47 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in how Keystone handles extremely long passwords was discovered.  When Keystone is validating a password, glibc allocated space on the stack for the entire password.  If the password is long enough, stack space can be exhausted which will lead to a crash.  A remote attacker could use this to cause a crash in Keystone by submitting a long password when attempting to log into an existing account; an attacker must know an existing account name to attempt the login with for this attack to be successful.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=805551#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-21 15:12:41 UTC  ``` This flaw is embargoed until 20120327.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=805551#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-21 15:18:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 571739](attachment.cgi?id=571739&action=diff "preliminary patch to fix the flaw") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=571739&action=edit "preliminary patch to fix the flaw") preliminary patch to fix the flaw   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=805551#c3)  Pádraig Brady    2012-03-27 15:08:03 UTC  ``` Hi Vincent. Distro bugs have been created and block this one. Corresponding updates have been pushed. I can't make this public. Can you please?  cheers.   ``` |  |
