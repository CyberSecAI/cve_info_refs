| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=840206#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-14 11:47:57 UTC  ``` Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward and history.back are used to navigate to a site while displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the older, displayed site.  Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-45.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=840206#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-07-17 18:57:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1089 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1089.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=840206#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-07-17 19:28:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1088 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1088.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=840205#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-14 11:37:46 UTC  ``` Google security researcher Abhishek Arya used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused when an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but attempts are made to call into objects in this array later. The second use-after-free problem is in nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document and then adopts into another document, emptying the first one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are dereferenced. The bad cast happens when nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.  All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.

## Details

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948),

[CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If

the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Thunderbird. This is a

  known issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be

  fixed in a later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make

all the necessary changes.

Package        : iceweasel

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1948 CVE-2012-1950 CVE-2012-1954 CVE-2012-1966
                 CVE-2012-1967

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web
browser based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides
rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.

CVE-2012-1948

  Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey
  identified several memory safety problems that may lead to the
  execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1950

  Mario Gomes and Code Audit Labs discovered that it is possible
  to force iceweasel to display the URL of the previous entered site
  through drag and drop actions to the address bar. This can be
  abused to perform phishing attacks.

CVE-2012-1954

  Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem in nsDocument::AdoptNode
  that may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1966

  moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that it is possible to perform cross-site
  scripting attacks through the context menu when using data: URLs.

CVE-2012-1967

  moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that in certain cases, javascript: URLs can
  be executed so that scripts can escape the JavaScript sandbox and run
  with elevated privileges.

Note: We'd like to advise users of Iceweasel's 3.5 branch in Debian
stable to consider to upgrade to the Iceweasel 10.0 ESR (Extended
Support Release) which is now available in Debian Backports.
Although Debian will continue to support Iceweasel 3.5 in stable with
security updates, this can only be done on a best effort base as
upstream provides no such support anymore. On top of that, the 10.0
branch adds proactive security features to the browser.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.16-17.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.6esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

### Description

Google security researcher **Abhishek Arya** used the Address
Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two use-after-free problems, one out of
bounds read bug, and a bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused
when an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but attempts are made
to call into objects in this array later. The second use-after-free problem is
in nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document and then adopts
into another document, emptying the first one. The heap buffer overflow is in
ElementAnimations when data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called
with frames in aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column group
frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.

All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.

I think part of what went wrong is that when I wrote this code:
if (whichIteration == anim.mIterationCount) {
// When the animation's iteration count is an integer (as it
// normally is), we need to end at 100% of its last iteration
// rather than 0% of the next one.
--whichIteration;
}
I wasn't considering the possibility that whichIteration (and anim.mIterationCount) were 0.
(I need to compare to the way currentIterationCount is calculated.)

So without this patch, what happened was that whichIteration would end up being PRUint32(-1) which is really PRUint32(2^31 - 1), which mean that positionInIteration would end up being double(2^32) (because of 'alternate'), and then we'd either fail (in a debug build):
NS\_ABORT\_IF\_FALSE(0.0 <= positionInIteration &&
positionInIteration <= 1.0,
"position should be in [0-1]");
or we'd end up reading off the end of the segments array a bit below.
So then we'd end up reading data off the end of an array: doing floating point math on it, and potentially dereferencing pointers (if the tags in the nsStyleAnimation::Value are right for that). I'm not sure what security rating that deserves.

Depends on what they point at. If they're objects with virtual methods and we call anything on it then that's very bad. Depends on what we're doing with them.

They're tagged union objects without virtual methods, though if you have the right tag \*twice\* (i.e., a tagged union pointed to by another tagged union) you could get to an object with virtual methods on the fourth dereference (nsStyleAnimation::Value\* -> nsCSSValue\* -> nsCSSValue::Image\* -> imgIRequest\*). Maybe even the third if I'm missing a shorter path.

approving for all branches, low risk and still early enough in the beta cycle that we should catch any issues.

## Details

USN-1509-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides an updated

ubufox package for use with the lastest Firefox.

Original advisory details:

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

Matt McCutchen discovered a clickjacking vulnerability in the certificate

warning page. A remote attacker could trick a user into accepting a malicious

certificate via a crafted certificate warning page. ([CVE-2012-1964](/security/CVE-2012-1964))

Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili discovered that javascript was not filtered out

of feed URLs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an

attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks. ([CVE-2012-1965](/security/CVE-2012-1965))

A vulnerability was discovered in the context menu of data: URLs. If the user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2012-1966](/security/CVE-2012-1966))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Firefox. This is a known

  issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be fixed in a

  later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

This bug reproduces quite frequently in my fuzzing, however there is not reliable reproduction or minimized testcase. The ASAN free and alloc stacks might be helpful in fixing the bug. I will update bug if i get a reliable repro.

Looks like a bug in AdoptNodeIntoOwnerDoc to me, assuming that the free and the use are the same call.Component: General → DOMProduct: Firefox → CoreQA Contact: general → general

Just a fyi, some stack frames would be missing since it is an optimized build [if i had a repro, i would have used a fully symbolized build as in other bugs i usually file]. I think the use-after-free is happening in nsDocument::AdoptNode.
The raw oldDocument pointer [nsIDocument \*oldDocument = adoptedNode->OwnerDoc();] is probably getting freed here
rv = nsNodeUtils::Adopt(adoptedNode, sameDocument ? nsnull : mNodeInfoManager,
6114 cx, newScope, nodesWithProperties);
and later accessed here - 6122 for (PRUint32 j = 0; j < oldDocument->GetPropertyTableCount(); ++j) {
see PRUint32 GetPropertyTableCount()
953 { return mExtraPropertyTables.Length() + 1; }
and we crash while accessing Length(). [#0 0x7fe983d5d952 in nsTArray\_base<nsTArrayDefaultAllocator>::Length() const firefox/src/../../../dist/include/nsTArray.h:192]
This is just my cursory look, someone more familiar should take a closer look :)

Olli, could you please take a look at this? It looks like there's a raw pointer to an OwnerDoc(), and maybe the underlying doc is going away. You last touched that line, though it was just a rename. ;)Assignee: nobody → bugs

Did you try with an ASANified release build from <https://people.mozilla.com/~choller/firefox/asan/> ? It reproduces for me on multiple machines. Also, the new symbolized stack seems to match my analysis in c#2.

No. Never heard of ASANified builds before :)
Anyhow, I'll post a patch soon.

Attached patch

[possible patch](attachment.cgi?id=636260&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=636260&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=765139&attachment=636260)

Based on the comments here, and looking at the code, this might work.
But since I can't reproduce, can't be sure.
Could anyone, who can reproduce the problem, try this.

Ok, I can see the crash using Nightly ASAN build. Unfortunately it doesn't crash when
run in gdb.

And looks like I managed to reproduce the crash only once.

So I guess what happens is that we adopt into an empty document and then adopt into another document, so the first document becomes empty again and it's destroyed during the second adopt? It's a bit scary to fix this without really understanding what happens :-(.

possible patch
a=dveditz for all the branches. The problem is pretty obvious from the patch, and if it's popping out of fuzzing often then it's got a reasonable chance of being rediscovered in the next 6 weeks.

I'm unable to reproduce this crash using the attached testcase and an ASAN debug Nightly based off mozilla-central 2012-07-08. Unless a more reproducible testcase can be provided, I'm not sure QA will be able to verify this bug is fixed. Can anyone provide any insight or assistance in verify this fix?Whiteboard: [asan][advisory-tracking+] → [asan][advisory-tracking+][qa?]

I remember testing this fix (c#13) and the testcase was 100% reproducible for me.

It's 0% reproducible for me. Would you mind verifying if this is fixed with a latest Nightly build?

Thanks! Marking this verified against Nightly. We won't be able to verify this against Beta/Release/ESR due to technical constraints.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1948 CVE-2012-1950 CVE-2012-1954 CVE-2012-1967

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.

CVE-2012-1948
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	were fixed.

CVE-2012-1950
	The underlying browser engine allows address bar spoofing
	through drag-and-drop.

CVE-2012-1954
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the nsDocument::AdoptNode
	function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(heap memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1967
	An error in the implementation of the Javascript sandbox
	allows execution of Javascript code with improper privileges
	using javascript: URLs.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze12.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1088)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2012-1948, CVE-2012-1951, CVE-2012-1952, CVE-2012-1953,
CVE-2012-1954, CVE-2012-1958, CVE-2012-1962, CVE-2012-1967)

A malicious web page could bypass same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
and execute arbitrary code with chrome privileges. (CVE-2012-1959)

A flaw in the context menu functionality in Firefox could allow a malicious
website to bypass intended restrictions and allow a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1966)

A page different to that in the address bar could be displayed when
dragging and dropping to the address bar, possibly making it easier for a
malicious site or user to perform a phishing attack. (CVE-2012-1950)

A flaw in the way Firefox called history.forward and history.back could
allow an attacker to conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user
into believing they are viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2012-1955)

A flaw in a parser utility class used by Firefox to parse feeds (such as
RSS) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. This issue could have affected
other browser components or add-ons that assume the class returns
sanitized input. (CVE-2012-1957)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled X-Frame-Options headers could allow a
malicious website to perform a clickjacking attack. (CVE-2012-1961)

A flaw in the way Content Security Policy (CSP) reports were generated by
Firefox could allow a malicious web page to steal a victim's OAuth 2.0
access tokens and OpenID credentials. (CVE-2012-1963)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled certificate warnings could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to create a crafted warning, possibly tricking
a user into accepting an arbitrary certificate as trusted. (CVE-2012-1964)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled feed:javascript URLs could allow output
filtering to be bypassed, possibly leading to a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1965)

The nss update RHBA-2012:0337 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
introduced a mitigation for the CVE-2011-3389 flaw. For compatibility
reasons, it remains disabled by default in the nss packages. This update
makes Firefox enable the mitigation by default. It can be disabled by
setting the NSS\_SSL\_CBC\_RANDOM\_IV environment variable to 0 before
launching Firefox. (BZ#838879)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.6 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill
McCloskey, Abhishek Arya, Arthur Gerkis, Bill Keese, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Bobby
Holley, Code Audit Labs, Mariusz Mlynski, Mario Heiderich, Frederic Buclin,
Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Matt McCutchen, Mario Gomes, and Soroush Dalili as
the original reporters of these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.6 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to 14.0.1 to fix various bugs
and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed: MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla
developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence
of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
presume that with enough effort at least some of these
could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
CVE-2012-1949: Brian Smith, Gary Kwong, Christian Holler,
Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey,
and Kyle Huey reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 13.
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian
Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 13.
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher Mario
Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a mechanism
to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop to the
addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes the
address of the previously site entered to be displayed in
the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page. This
could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya used
the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode CVE-2012-1953:
Out of bounds read in ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor
CVE-2012-1952: Bad cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher Mariusz
Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the location
property. In this issue, calls to history.forward and
history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
through the context menu using a data: URL. In this issue,
context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show only this
frame", and "View background image") are disallowed in a
javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL, allowing for
XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher Mario
Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed in the
HTML feed-view using <embed> tag within the RSS
<description>. This problem is due to <embed> tags not
being filtered out during parsing and can lead to a
potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The flaw
existed in a parser utility class and could affect other
parts of the browser or add-ons which rely on that class to
sanitize untrusted input.
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher Arthur
Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony Payne
reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS, Mozilla’s
color management library. With a carefully crafted color
profile portions of a user's memory could be incorporated
into a transformed image and possibly deciphered.
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer Frédéric
Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header is ignored
when the value is duplicated, for example X-Frame-Options:
SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication occurs for unknown
reasons on some websites and when it occurs results in
Mozilla browsers not being protected against possible
clickjacking attacks on those pages.
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher Bill
Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher Matt
McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using the
certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers Mario
Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla allows
the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL, it is
possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution attack
using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed

add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes one version update.
Description:
MozillaFirefox have been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The ollowing security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
\*
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman,
Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox
13.
\*
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher
Mario Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a
mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop
to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes
the address of the previously site entered to be displayed
in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page.
This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
\*
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya
used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-afte.r-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
o CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased o CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode o
CVE-2012-1953: Out of bounds read in
ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor o CVE-2012-1952: Bad
cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
\*
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward
and history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack through the context menu using a data: URL. In
this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show
only this frame", and "View background image") are
disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL,
allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher
Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed
in the HTML feed-view using tag within the RSS . This
problem is due to tags not being filtered out during
parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class
and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.
\*
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher
Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
\*
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony
Payne reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS,
Mozilla's color management library. With a carefully
crafted color profile portions of a user's memory could be
incorporated into a transformed image and possibly
deciphered.
\*
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer
Frederic Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header
is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication
occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it
occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected
against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.
\*
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher
Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher
Matt McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using
the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
\*
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers
Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla
allows the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL,
it is possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution
attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

## Details

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

Matt McCutchen discovered a clickjacking vulnerability in the certificate

warning page. A remote attacker could trick a user into accepting a malicious

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Firefox. This is a known

  issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be fixed in a

  later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.
