Umbraco Open Proxy Vulnerability
Advisory ID: MATTA-2012-001
CVE reference: CVE-2012-1301
Affected platforms: Umbraco
Version: 4.x
Date: 2012-January-26
Security risk: High
Vulnerability: Umbraco bundles a script behaving like an open-proxy
Researcher: Florent Daigniere
Vendor Status: Notified / Patch available
Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:
https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/matta-disclosure-policy-01.txt
Permanent URL:
https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/MATTA-2012-001.txt
=====================================================================
Description:
Vulnerable installations of Umbraco allow unauthenticated users to
abuse the script FeedProxy.aspx into proxying requests on their
behalf through the "url" parameter.
=====================================================================
Impact
Anyone with access to the management interface of umbraco can abuse
FeedProxy script into proxying requests for them.
The impact of such vulnerability is difficult to measure and depends
on the specifics of the deployment. Typically, this can allow
attackers to connect to other systems, bypassing controls or be
abused to trick users and browsers into performing actions they
wouldn't otherwise consider (XSS, phishing, ...).
This particular vulnerability can also be abused to create a powerful
Denial of Service: a single recursive proxy-request will take the
application server down and, depending on the configuration of the
server, might severely affect unrelated services.
=====================================================================
Versions affected:
Umbraco version 4.7.0 tested.
=====================================================================
Threat mitigation
Matta consultants recommend deleting the FeedProxy script or
upgrading umbraco to version 5+.
=====================================================================
Credits
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Florent Daigniere
from Matta Consulting.

### VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Cost-effective Security Assessments Managed by our senior security consultants.**

External Vulnerability Scanning is a crucial part of every security programme. However, budgets do not always allow for the cost of an extensive consultancy-based Penetration Test.

Cost-effective automated scanners go some way to resolving this issue, but the limitations of automated systems are well-documented and understood. The reports produced contain multiple false positives, and it becomes the responsibility of the client to work through the issues to determine the real issues from the false ones. On a typical external network of 64 IP addresses, this can take between one and three full-time days for someone will the skills and up-to-date knowledge to perform.

![image](img2/penetration+testing.png)
### Penetration TESTING

Which Penetration Test is Right for You? Penetration Testing can include so many different elements, that the first challenge is first deciding what tests should be commissioned.

Matta has advisors, which can help you scope the requirements based on your objectives, budget and timescale. In a perfect world all the requirements can be met with the existing budget you had in mind. If this is not possible, however, we can suggest ways to gain the most benefit, and prioritise activities.

External Penetration Test Conducting a penetration test on the public facing network is something most companies should consider doing at least annually. Apart from the obvious reasons of good compliance, it is important to supplement any VA work you may be doing with a full consultant based Penetration Test to ensure that your network is truly as robust as you think it may be from an attacker.
