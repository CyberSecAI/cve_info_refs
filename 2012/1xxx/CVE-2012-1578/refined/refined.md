Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1578:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The MediaWiki API's block/unblock modules had a flaw in how they handled token verification. Specifically, these modules were not correctly enforcing the presence of a security token when processing block or unblock requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF issue. The API allowed actions (block/unblock user) to be performed without a valid security token, or even without a token being provided at all.
- **Incorrect Evaluation:** The code logic responsible for checking the presence of the token had an incorrect evaluation, causing the check to fail. `!isset( $foo['bar'] )` evaluates to `false` even when $foo['bar'] is set to false. This meant the code to die for a missing token parameter was never met.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially force a logged-in user with block privileges to block or unblock another user without their consent or knowledge.
- Could be used to disrupt the wiki by blocking legitimate users, which in turn causes denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would craft a malicious link or webpage that makes a request to the vulnerable block/unblock API modules.
- If a logged-in user with block privileges visited the malicious page, their browser would make the request without any token, causing the block/unblock action to execute as if it were a legitimate request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in MediaWiki user with block privileges to interact with a crafted malicious link or page.
- The attacker does not need any direct access to the MediaWiki server or database.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affected MediaWiki versions 1.17 and 1.18.
- The fix involved correcting the logical error in the token check and ensuring that requests to the block/unblock API require a valid token parameter.
- The issue was fixed in MediaWiki 1.17.3 and 1.18.2, and the patch was applied to WMF servers.
