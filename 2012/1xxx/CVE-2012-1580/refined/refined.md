Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1580:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) check in the `Special:Upload` feature of MediaWiki.
*   The MediaWiki developers had previously disabled the token check for file uploads, assuming it was impossible to forge a file upload using JavaScript. This assumption was proven incorrect with the advent of HTML5 features in modern browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a cross-site request forgery. The application does not properly validate that the upload request is coming from an authorized user/session on the server itself.
*   **Missing CSRF protection:** The `Special:Upload` functionality lacked the necessary CSRF token validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Upload Manipulation:** An attacker could force a logged-in user's browser to upload a file to the MediaWiki installation without the user's knowledge or consent.
*   **Potential Wiki Compromise:** The impact of this vulnerability depended on the wiki's configuration:
    *   **Private Wikis:** Private wikis with broader allowed file types were at higher risk. An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, executable files) that could compromise the wiki's server if not properly handled.
    *   **Public Wikis:** Even public wikis were vulnerable, although the impact might be less severe due to typically stricter file type restrictions. However, an attacker could still potentially cause damage or defacement, or even upload malicious files if the protections are not strong.
*   **Firewall Bypass:**  The CSRF attack could be carried out from an external website, bypassing firewalls designed to protect the wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **External Website:** An attacker would need to host a malicious website containing JavaScript code designed to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** A logged-in user needs to visit the malicious site to trigger the file upload. This is a classic CSRF attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External attacker:** The attacker does not need to be a user on the target MediaWiki instance.
*   **Malicious Website Hosting:** Ability to host an external website or inject the malicious code into an existing site.
*   **Target User Login:** The attack relies on a logged-in user visiting the malicious site.
*   **Knowledge of the Target:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the target MediaWiki website's upload functionality.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **HTML5 and FormData/BlobBuilder:** Modern browsers enabled this attack by allowing file uploads via JavaScript using `FormData` and `BlobBuilder` (or similar functionality).
*   **XMLHttpRequests:**  The vulnerability could have potentially been exploited earlier using `XMLHttpRequests` with custom encoding of the POST body, although the provided materials indicate HTML5 made it easier.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** The vulnerability was exploitable in modern browsers like Firefox and Chrome (as early as 2010).
*   **Patch:** The fix involved re-enabling the CSRF token check for Special:Upload
