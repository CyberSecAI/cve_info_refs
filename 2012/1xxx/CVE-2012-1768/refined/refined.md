Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1768:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided documents, particularly the Microsoft Security Bulletins MS12-058 and MS12-067, and CERT Vulnerability Note VU#118913, explicitly mention CVE-2012-1768 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed. These sources confirm the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause lies in the way Oracle Outside In libraries parse specific file formats. These libraries are used by Microsoft Exchange Server (for WebReady Document Viewing) and FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint (via the Advanced Filter Pack).
   - Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the DPT file parser within the Oracle Outside In libraries.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - The core weakness is improper parsing of DPT files by the Oracle Outside In libraries.
   - This leads to a remote code execution vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Microsoft Exchange:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the security context of the transcoding service, which runs under the LocalService account. This account has limited privileges.
   - **FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user account with a restricted token, but only if the Advanced Filter Pack is enabled.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Microsoft Exchange:** An attacker can send a specially crafted DPT file as an email attachment to a user. If the user previews the attachment in Outlook Web App (OWA) via WebReady Document Viewing, the malicious code could be executed on the Exchange server.
   - **FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint:** An attacker would need to upload a specially crafted DPT file to a location that FAST Search indexes, exploiting the parsing functionality of the Advanced Filter Pack.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Microsoft Exchange:**
     - Ability to send emails to users of the vulnerable Exchange server.
     - No other special privileges required, as the vulnerability is triggered by user action within OWA.
   - **FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint:**
     - Ability to upload files to locations that the search server indexes.
     - No other specific position required, though it is relevant that the Advanced Filter Pack has to be enabled.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is within third-party code (Oracle Outside In libraries) licensed by Microsoft.
- The issue affects multiple products due to the shared use of the vulnerable libraries.
- Microsoft released security updates to address the vulnerabilities in both Exchange Server and FAST Search Server.
- Workarounds for Microsoft Exchange include disabling WebReady document viewing. The workaround for FAST involves disabling the Advanced Filter Pack.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security updates.

In summary, CVE-2012-1768 represents a remote code execution vulnerability stemming from improper parsing of DPT files by Oracle Outside In libraries. Successful exploitation could enable attackers to execute code on vulnerable Exchange or FAST Search servers, depending on the specific attack vector. The provided documents provide a comprehensive overview, including affected software, mitigation steps, and technical details.
