Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-1613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input data. Specifically, the `edit_one_pic.php` script in Coppermine 1.5.18 doesn't properly validate user-provided keywords before inserting them into the database. These keywords are later used in HTML meta tags without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. When a user with the necessary privileges modifies a picture's keywords via `edit_one_pic.php`, they can inject malicious JavaScript code. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when other users view the image, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation of the stored XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view an image with the malicious keywords.
- **Potential for various attacks:** This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing user credentials or sensitive data
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of Coppermine, specifically using the form at `edit_one_pic.php`.
- **User-supplied input:** The vulnerability is triggered by user input provided in the "Keywords" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged User Access:**  The attacker needs to be a Coppermine user with the privileges necessary to edit picture information (i.e. modify picture keywords). This is not an anonymous attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Waraxe (Janek Vind)
- The issue is fixed in Coppermine 1.5.20
-  The advisory is identified as waraxe-2012-SA#081

In summary, CVE-2012-1613 is a stored XSS vulnerability in Coppermine 1.5.18 arising from improper sanitization of user-provided keywords. Attackers with appropriate user privileges can inject malicious JavaScript, which can then be executed in other users' browsers, potentially leading to various malicious activities.
