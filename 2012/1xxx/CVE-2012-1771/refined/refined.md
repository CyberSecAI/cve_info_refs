  "cveId": "CVE-2012-1771",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to the way Oracle Outside In libraries parse specially crafted files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed data by the Oracle Outside In libraries.",
      "Remote code execution vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution within the security context of the user account running the vulnerable application.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "An attacker needs access to a file location that FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint indexes and the ability to upload a specially crafted file to that location."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to upload a specially crafted file to a location that is indexed by the vulnerable software.",
    "additionalDetails": [
      "The vulnerability exists in the Oracle Outside In libraries used by the Advanced Filter Pack feature of FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint. The Advanced Filter Pack is disabled by default.",
      "The vulnerable libraries are also used by Microsoft Exchange Server WebReady Document Viewing.",
      "The vulnerability affects multiple file formats such as .VSD, .WSD, .JP2, .DOC, .SXD, .LWP, .PCX, .SXI, .DPT, .PDF, .SAM, .ODG, and .CDR.",
      "The vulnerability is addressed by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version.",
      "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the affected server. In the case of Exchange server, the code would run as LocalService. In the case of FAST Search server the code would run in the context of a user account with restricted token."
