The provided document discusses the risks associated with SSL/TLS interception proxies, focusing on how they can undermine the security provided by these protocols. It specifically mentions CVE-2012-1316 in relation to the Cisco IronPort Web Security Appliance, identifying it as a vulnerability due to a lack of certificate revocation checking.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2012-1316:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the failure of the Cisco IronPort Web Security Appliance (WSA) to perform certificate revocation checks using either Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Lack of Certificate Revocation Checking:** The primary vulnerability is that the WSA does not verify if a server-side certificate has been revoked before generating a new client-side certificate. This leads to a situation where a revoked certificate is treated as valid for the client-side connection.
    *   **Transitive Trust:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the "transitive trust" model where the client trusts the proxy, and the proxy trusts the server. If the proxy fails to validate revocation, the client inherits the proxy's trust even if the server's certificate is invalid.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform MITM attacks outside the proxy. This is done by using a compromised, revoked certificate for the target domain.
    *   **Spoofing:** The proxy will issue a new certificate signed by its trusted CA, making the client believe it is connected to a legitimate server when it is actually communicating with the attacker.
    *   **Data Interception/Manipulation:** Once the MITM is established, the attacker can intercept and potentially modify the plain-text content of encrypted sessions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **External MITM:** The attack occurs outside the interception proxy, where the attacker intercepts the connection between the proxy and the server.
    *   **Compromised Certificates:** The attacker needs to obtain a certificate that was once valid but has since been revoked. This certificate is then presented to the proxy.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **External Network Position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept the traffic between the proxy and the target server.
    *   **Compromised Certificate:** The attacker needs access to a revoked certificate that was previously trusted by the proxy.

The document provides more detail than the basic CVE description by explaining the context of SSL interception proxies, detailing the process of transitive trust, and demonstrating how the lack of revocation checking can be exploited in a MITM attack. It also presents several other vulnerabilities in the Cisco IronPort WSA and other products.
