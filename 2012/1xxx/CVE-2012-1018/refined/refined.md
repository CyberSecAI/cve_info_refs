- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mod_currencyconverter` module for Joomla is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `convert.php` script within the `mod_currencyconverter` module does not properly sanitize the `from` GET parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, phishing, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `from` parameter of the `convert.php` script within the vulnerable module. For example: `http://[victim]/path/modules/mod_currencyconverter/includes/convert.php?from=[XSS]`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to visit it. No prior authentication or access is required. The attacker can be remote.
