Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from missing bounds checks within the `file` utility and its associated library, `libmagic`, when processing malformed Composite Document File (CDF) format files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Bounds Checks:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of file structures and offsets within CDF files. Specifically, the code reads values from the file without ensuring they are within valid bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By supplying a specially crafted, malformed CDF file, an attacker can trigger the missing bounds checks and cause the `file` utility (or applications using `libmagic`) to crash. This can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed CDF File:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious CDF file containing invalid data to exploit the lack of bounds checking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted CDF file to the `file` utility, or to an application that uses the vulnerable `libmagic` library for file type identification.

**Additional Technical Details from the Provided Content:**

*   **Specific Code Changes (From GitHub Commits):**
    *   The provided GitHub commit diffs highlight specific fixes made to the `cdf.c` file to address the vulnerability.
    *   These fixes include the addition of `assert()` statements and checks to validate the `id` value within the `cdf_read_short_sector` function.
    *   The code was modified to compare the calculated sector positions with the actual lengths to prevent out-of-bounds reads, using  `if (pos > ss * sst->sst_len)` and  `if (q > e)`  checks.
*   **Debian Security Advisory:** The Debian security advisory DSA-2422-1 confirms that the vulnerability is in the processing of malformed CDF files, leading to crashes.
*   **Ubuntu Security Notice:** The Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2123-1 confirms the vulnerability and mentions that it can cause a crash leading to a denial of service. It also states that the vulnerability affects Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

In summary, CVE-2012-1571 is a denial-of-service vulnerability caused by missing bounds checks when processing malformed CDF files in the `file` utility. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted file, leading to a crash.
