How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,

Is these hotfixes applied to the Software Installation package?

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Jan 25, 2012 02:51 PM

Yes, a new version of Software Installation package has been uploaded under "download" section and it includes all the fixed bug mentioned above.

Thanks support! Is there any reason this wasn't released as a service pack? Manually patching existing installations is a bit of a pain (and a bit risky) so would prefer a service pack that can be run through the deployment centre.

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Jan 26, 2012 11:35 AM

@Celia, the goal was to make minimum impact on sites that you want to patch. The fact that you have to copy the dll's to the bin folder is the only changes to files required in the site. When we are releasing service packs the impact on the site is generally much greater. For service packs we typically update assembly version, change configuration, update the database schema etc.

Do you have to update all R2 sites when you have installed this patch (run DB scripts etc) or will old R2 sites still work without any changes after the installation?

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Jan 26, 2012 12:49 PM

I have been waiting for this for along time. Thanks for finally releasing it!

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Jan 26, 2012 01:29 PM

@Viktor, Actually, it's a required to upgrade all R2 sites on a machine and for all sites that share the same database. Given that the CLR will prefer the GAC:ed assemblies (over assemblies in bin) you will effectively patch binaries for all sites on a machine by doing the reinstall of the msi's. The copying of files to the bin folder is for hygienic reasons to keep everything in sync.

Regarding the schema update, you need to apply that on all R2 databases affected by the patch.

Finally, thanx!

Is the "Fetch pages from" DB script 0006\_0000\_0535\_0000to0006\_0001\_0233\_0000.sql

Mentioned here:

http://world.episerver.com/Documentation/Items/Installation-Instructions/EPiServer-CMS/Version-6/EPiServer-CMS-6-R2/Installation-Instructions---EPiServer-CMS-6-R2/

included in the installer?

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Jan 26, 2012 01:45 PM

@Daniel, Indeed! It is refered to as:

64439 Some fields of tblWorkPage are null after upgrading from CMS 6 to R2

in the bug list.

Seems like the database-script was not added in the installation-package. We had to run the script manually after installing the CMS6 R2 installation (updated January 25).

I installed this on one of our servers. However when I uninstalled the current version of 6r2 and then installed this version the GAC was not updated. I had to manually install the new EPiServer.dll into the GAC myself. Should the install have put the dll into the GAC? As the bug fix I needed was not fixed until I put this in the GAC.

We're on a tight schedule close to production and we really need to know the details on some of these bugs in order to decide whether to invest some time into trying to apply this patch.

I tried to look up some of the fixed bugs in that wonderful (sarcasm intended) bug list tool over at http://world.episerver.com/Support/Bug-List but no matter what filters I try I fail to find some of the mentioned bugs...

How can I find the details of a bug if I know the bug ID? Seems like a simple request..

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Feb 3, 2012 08:31 AM

@Johan: You can search the bug against its title in the bug list. Below is how I did:

Qurey Fixed/known Bugs | EPiServer CMS | 6R2 | "title of the bug" | All Keywords

However if you still find some trouble, send a query to developer support to get all the required details.

OK this is fun. Let's pick the last bug in the list, 75277. Copy the title. Paste it into the freetext field. First search "Fixed bugs". Wait like 10 seconds. 0 hits. Hmm ok, thought it was fixed. But let's try search "Known bugs" then. Switch in the first combo and search anew. Again wait 10 seconds... 0 hits. I still think it is very strange that you cannot find a bug either by ID or title... Where do I file my complaints? =)

When are you going to update the NuGet packages with this release? If you are to make a point out of the repository, it should be updated simultaneously as executables are shipped.

I have ran the script on CMS 6 R2 following the steps and Fetch pages issue is still there. It is still missing all the link pages on the site. Is there a easy way to rollback the site from R2 to R1?

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Feb 24, 2012 09:59 AM

@Mohammed: Sorry, i don't have a solution for rollback to R1. Should be easy if you restore the database from old backup before upgrading to R2. (if you have one).

Regarding "fetch pages issue", it should have been fixed in the hotfix anyhow could you please run it through developer support and leave all information in support ticket.

Feb 24, 2012 01:21 PM

Thanks Shahid. I have raised this with Developer support. I rolled back my databse as I initially upgraded from CMS 5 R2. When I upgraded to CMS 6 R1 I am getting the same issue so it is not only when upgrading from CMS 6 R1 to R2 it is also happening when you upgrade from CMS 5 R2 to CMS 6. Any idea if there is a fix for that some where?

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Mar 13, 2012 09:19 AM

Any chance you could do a real service pack where you update the assembly version?

It is hard for us to keep track of what version our customers sites are on when the same assembly version is used.

![](/globalassets/useravatars/userunknown.jpg)

Mar 15, 2012 12:01 PM

@Alex: There is no such plan of releasing a service pack now since dev teams are finalizing the code for Falcon release. Releasing a SP means alot of efforts, to make all the products, modules, connectors compatible with latest release.

For every hotfix, we only update the assembly file version, which is somehow easy to back track.

You need to be careful when upgrading a server with Community / Relate Plus. If you install (i.e. run setup.exe) the new 6.1.379.501 version of CMS and then install Relate Plus R2, the newer files in CMS will be overwritten. This is because the Relate Plus installer also installs a version of CMS (the original). Both the new and old CMS msi files presumably have the same version number which means they will overwrite each other regardless of whether files are newer or older.

If you install Relate Plus after the 501 version of CMS, you will loose many important fixes from 501.

Apr 3, 2012 09:59 AM

Thanks for sharing Paul.

I think this is a real mess. R2 is seriously buggy (the one that gets the most complaints from our customers is the one when you get an error when you publish a page at random times, and the XHTML property serialization bug cripples dynamic content to near useless). I know the team is busy with Falcon, but you need to support CMS 6 R2 as well.

You have already made the hotfixes part of the CMS 6 R2 download, so you will need to ensure compatibility with other products and modules anyway.

Please clean up this mess and release a service pack.

Seriously this is a f#¤"#¤ mess. Release a service pack for all products. It is not that funny to make other sites bad because you like to make one site better. we have also had some trouble with the problem regarding installing relate on a server with the hotfix for r2.

You need to ensure that all your download packages that have the cms installer are updated with this hotfix..

As Alexander said:

Please clean up this mess and release a service pack!!

I have upgraded from 6R2 v 6.1.379.1 to 6.1.379.1000. After I managed to sort out the mix of different versions of log4net being used by different EPiServer products (cms/framework/etc) it now seems to work fine, except I haven't run the SchemaUpdate.sql script because I cannot find it. It says it should be "under attachment on the target site (6R2) database." Could someone please tell me: where is that?
