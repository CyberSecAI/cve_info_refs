{
  "CVE-2012-1856": {
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability exists in the Windows common controls (specifically the TabStrip ActiveX control) due to improper handling of system state, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of system state in an ActiveX control.",
      "Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Windows Common Controls (MSCOMCTL.OCX)."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the system, install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted document (e.g., Office document or RTF file) opened by the user.",
       "Specially crafted webpage viewed in Internet Explorer, which exploits the vulnerability through a compromised or malicious website."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to create a specially crafted document or webpage.",
      "Ability to convince a user to open the malicious document or visit the malicious website (e.g. by tricking the user into clicking a link in an email or instant message)."
    ],
    "Additional Details": [
      "The vulnerability is located in the MSCOMCTL.OCX file, specifically within the TabStrip ActiveX control.",
      "The fix involves disabling the vulnerable ActiveX control by setting a kill bit and replacing it with a new, patched version.",
       "The update addresses the vulnerability by disabling the vulnerable version of the Windows common controls. It does this by setting the kill bit for the following class identifiers hosted in the library files: `1EFB6596-857C-11D1-B16A-00C0F0283628`"
