Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw present in the Segue content management system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into input fields, which is then executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the system's authentication mechanism.
- **Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in as an administrator, granting them full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Network-Based Attack:** The attack can be carried out over the network, likely through HTTP requests.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior access or valid credentials.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The exploit can be triggered without any action from legitimate users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any pre-existing access to the system.
- **Moderate Expertise:** The JPCERT/CC analysis suggests that exploiting the vulnerability requires "some expertise and/or luck", but doesn't require overly complex skills.

**Additional details:**
- The provided CVSS v2 score is 7.5 (High) with vector string AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P. This indicates a network-based attack vector, low attack complexity, no authentication required, and partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- The vendor has advised users not to use Segue and provided information on data migration as the service was discontinued.
