Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-1958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs in the `nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden` function within Mozilla products (Firefox and Thunderbird).
- Specifically, the issue arises when `mFocusedContent` is released, and `oldFocusedContent` is subsequently used, even after the memory associated with `mFocusedContent` may have been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a classic use-after-free, where a program attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability could potentially lead to an application crash, effectively resulting in a DoS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** It's possible that an attacker could leverage the use-after-free to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application (Firefox or Thunderbird).
-  According to Red Hat, "a malicious web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox."

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Web Page:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted web page. The content of this page would be designed to trigger the use-after-free within the `nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden` function when the page is hidden.
-  According to Ubuntu, "If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious web page to the victim. This could be done through various methods, such as:
  - Embedding the malicious link in a phishing email.
  - Hosting the malicious page on a compromised website.
  - Using social engineering techniques to entice the user to visit the malicious page.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the victim; this is exploitable over the web.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Thunderbird ESR.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Arthur Gerkis using the Address Sanitizer tool.
- It appears a race condition was necessary, but it was not specified in detail.
- The fix involved ensuring that the `oldFocusedContent` was stored as an `nsCOMPtr`, a smart pointer type that will maintain a reference count, and prevent deallocation until no longer needed.
