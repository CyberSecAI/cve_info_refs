CVE-2012-1621: Apache OFBiz information disclosure vulnerability

**Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to improper handling of user input and template rendering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **XSS 1:** Error messages containing user input returned via AJAX requests were not being properly escaped.
    *   **XSS 2:** Parameter arrays (converted to Lists) were not being auto-encoded in FreeMarker templates. An attacker could send multiple parameters with the same name, resulting in a List instead of a String, bypassing automatic HTML encoding when rendered in FreeMarker.
    *   **XSS 3:** Requests using the CMS event were vulnerable due to the `contentId` and `mapKey` parameters. If the content was missing, an unencoded error message containing these values was sent to the browser.
    *   **XSS 4:** Requests using the experimental Webslinger component were susceptible to XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
    *   Manipulating AJAX requests to trigger unescaped error messages.
    *   Sending multiple parameters with the same name to exploit the lack of auto-encoding in FreeMarker templates.
    *   Providing crafted `contentId` and `mapKey` parameters to CMS events to trigger unencoded error messages.
    *   Sending malicious requests to the experimental Webslinger component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with crafted parameters to the vulnerable application.
