{
  "CVE-2012-1155": {
    "Description": "The export function of the database activity module in Moodle was exporting all entries, including those from groups the user is not a member of.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient access control in the database activity module export functionality. The export function did not properly check the user's group membership before exporting data, allowing users to potentially see data from groups they shouldn't have access to.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate access control",
	  "Information Exposure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain unauthorized access to information, by exporting database activity entries from groups they are not members of, leading to a potential data leak.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the database activity module's export functionality.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a user with access to a Moodle course that uses the database activity module and have the ability to initiate an export of data."
