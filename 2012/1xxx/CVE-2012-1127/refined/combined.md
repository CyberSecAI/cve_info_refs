| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=800587#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-06 18:48:53 UTC  ``` An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine retrieved properties information from Portable Compiled Format (PCF) bitmap font files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PCF font file, which once opened in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that application crash.  Upstream bug report: [1] <https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?35603>  Upstream patch: [2] <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/commit/?id=c776fc17bfeaa607405fc96620e9445e7a0965c3>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=800587#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2012-03-06 20:49:53 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/06/16>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=800587#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-14 17:19:56 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the freetype package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the freetype package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=800587#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-15 16:37:55 UTC  ``` The problem here is in pcf_get_properties(), which does not ensure that a string read form PCF font file is properly NUL terminated before passing it to strdup. This may possibly cause program crash.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=800587#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-10 19:58:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0467 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0467.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-21

## Multiple security flaws fixed in FreeType v2.4.9

Announced
April 24, 2012
Reporter
Mateusz Jurczyk
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox Mobile
Fixed in

* Firefox Mobile 10.0.4

### Description

**Mateusz Jurczyk** of the Google Security Team used the Address
Sanitizer tool to discover a series of memory safety bugs in the FreeType
library, some of which could cause memory corruption and exploitable crashes
with certain fonts and font parsing. Firefox Mobile has been upgraded to
FreeType version 2.4.9 which addresses these issues. Desktop Firefox does not
use Freetype for fonts and was not affected.

On Linux systems, Firefox will use the installed system library for FreeType. Linux users should make sure they are current on system security updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

We received a forward of this FreeType security issue. Per Dveditz, this is still used in Mobile Firefox. We should take the FreeType update to 2.4.9 since it looks like we still use 2.4.3 on Central (see <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/modules/freetype2/ChangeLog>).

From: Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@redhat.com>
Subject: [oss-security] CVE Request -- FreeType: Multiple security flaws to be fixed in v2.4.9
Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,
we have been notified by Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security Team,
about the following FreeType security flaws, which are going to be fixed
in v2.4.9 version.
Credit: Mateusz Jurczyk, Google Security Team
Note: Though some the issues below might look like related / the same,
I have checked that each of them exclude themselves (IOW each of them
is different issue like the another. But was lazy to cross-reference
those, which of them is different from which another.
Reproducers are attached to relevant upstream bug reports.
Have Cc-ed Werner Lemberg of FreeType upstream on this post too,
so he could collect CVE identifiers prior FreeType v2.4.9
release.
Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference
and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue
below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security
flaws. But other distributions might be doing so, thus will let
Steve to decide, if these two desire CVE identifiers or not.
And finally, due the count of the issues, not including full
issues description under each entry (to shorten the request).
Only particular Red Hat Bugzilla entry summary is included with
relevant links to upstream bugs and commits. Further issue
description can be found under particular Red Hat Bugzilla entry
for each of them in initial comment (#c0).
Kurt, Steve, could you allocate CVE identifiers for these?
Thank you && Regards, Jan.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=733512&attachment=604362)

This simply updates our in-tree freetype to the 2.4.9 release. Currently awaiting tryserver android results (<https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=54ae9d8f051c>), to check that it builds & runs ok.

patch, update freetype to release 2.4.9
[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): no regression - security update for freetype
User impact if declined: firefox mobile will be vulnerable to a number of known bugs, which are publicly disclosed as a result of the new freetype release (if not before) and might be exploitable via malicious downloadable fonts
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): only used in the mobile product; tryserver run for android and android-xul was fully green; currently on -inbound
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): low risk, this is simply updating to the current freetype release; the alternative would be trying to backport individual bugfixes to the old release we're using, but that would be far trickier/riskier
String changes made by this patch: updated freetype copyright year in toolkit/content/license.html

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=800583#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-06 18:46:11 UTC  ``` An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine performed parsing of glyph information and relevant bitmaps for glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF). A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted BDF font file, which once opened in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that application crash.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0467)

## Topic

Updated freetype packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
efficiently.

Multiple flaws were found in the way FreeType handled TrueType Font (TTF),
Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF), Windows .fnt and .fon, and
PostScript Type 1 fonts. If a specially-crafted font file was loaded by an
application linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application. (CVE-2012-1134, CVE-2012-1136, CVE-2012-1142,
CVE-2012-1144)

Multiple flaws were found in the way FreeType handled fonts in various
formats. If a specially-crafted font file was loaded by an application
linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2012-1126, CVE-2012-1127, CVE-2012-1130, CVE-2012-1131, CVE-2012-1132,
CVE-2012-1137, CVE-2012-1139, CVE-2012-1140, CVE-2012-1141, CVE-2012-1143)

Red Hat would like to thank Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security Team for
reporting these issues.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
(log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
