  "CVE-2012-1127": {
    "description": "An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine performed parsing of glyph information and relevant bitmaps for glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF). A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted BDF font file, which once opened in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that application crash.",
    "root_cause": "The FreeType font rendering engine does not properly validate the size of data when parsing glyph information and bitmaps from BDF font files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "Application crash",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Specially-crafted BDF font file"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to provide/deliver a malicious BDF font file to an application using FreeType"
