Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## Introduction

Cisco UCS™ Manager provides unified, embedded management of all software and hardware components of the Cisco Unified Computing System™ (Cisco UCS) across multiple chassis, rack-mount servers, and thousands of virtual machines. Cisco UCS Manager manages Cisco UCS as a single entity through an intuitive GUI, a command-line interface (CLI), or an XML API for comprehensive access to all Cisco UCS Manager functions.

### System Requirements

To install Cisco UCS Manager your computer must meet or exceed the following system requirements:

* The Cisco UCS Manager GUI is a Java-based application. Starting with Release 2.0(3a), Cisco UCS Manager supports both Sun JRE 1.6 and JRE 1.7. Versions earlier than Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(3a) require Sun JRE 1.6. (Sun JRE must be 32-bit version due to the lack of 64-bit native libraries for the KVM/VMedia; the 32-bit JRE can be executed in both Win32 and Win64, as well as Linux 32 and 64).
* Cisco UCS Manager uses web start and supports the following web browsers:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Mozilla Firefox 3.0 or higher

Adobe Flash Player 10 or higher is required for some features

* Cisco UCS Manager is supported on the following operating systems:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Windows XP

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Windows Vista

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Windows 7

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 or higher

### Hardware and Software Interoperability

For a complete list of hardware and software interdependencies, see the  *Hardware and Software Interoperability for UCSM Managed Servers*  for a specific Cisco UCS Manager release, here *:*

 <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/unified-computing-system/products-technical-reference-list.html>

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) VMware ESX and ESXi 4.0 are not compatible with Intel 56xx processors. 55xx processors are not affected by this limitation. See the interoperability matrix for this release for OS and other support questions.

---

### Updating Cisco UCS Versions

To update the Cisco UCS software and firmware, see the appropriate  [Upgrading Cisco UCS](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/ucs-manager/products-installation-guides-list.html)  document for your installation. All A, B, and C bundles must be at the exact same version and patch level.

Use the  **scope firmware** and  **show package**  *filename*  **expand** CLI commands to view the contents of a given release package. For information about the contents of the Cisco UCS bundle images for each Cisco UCS 2.0 release, see  *Release Bundle Contents for Cisco UCS Software, Release 2.0*.

## Internal Dependencies

 [Table 2](/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/release/notes/OL_25363.html#50743)  shows interdependencies between the hardware and versions of Cisco UCS Manager. Server FRU items such as DIMMs are dependent on their server type, and chassis items such as fans and power supplies work with all versions of Cisco UCS Manager.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)

---

**Caution**
![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You cannot mix component software versions (for example, you cannot have a B200 using the 1.0(1) BIOS with a UCS M81KR adapter running 1.0(2) firmware managed by Cisco UCS Manager 1.3(1)). Compare the minimum software version for all your components and use at least the latest of all the versions, or use the most current version of software for all components. Mixing M1 and M2 hardware versions is not an issue if they are running software at a version matching the other system components.

## Capability Catalog

The Cisco UCS Manager uses the catalog to update the display and configurability of server components such as newly qualified DIMMs and disk drives. The Cisco UCS Manager Capability Catalog is a single image, but it is also embedded in Cisco UCS Manager. Cisco UCS Manager 2.0 releases work with any 2.0 catalog file, but not the 1.0 catalog versions. If a server component is not dependent on a specific BIOS version, using it and having it recognized by Cisco UCS Manager is primarily a function of the catalog version. The catalog is released as a single image in some cases for convenience purposes in addition to being bundled with UCS infrastructure releases. See  [Table 3](/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/release/notes/OL_25363.html#24124)  for details on the mapping of versions to bundles.

### The following caveats are common across Release 2.0:

Table 28 Open Caveats that are Common across Release 2.0

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCuc15009 | Under some conditions, the IOM upgrade fails and gets into a continuous reboot after the IOM is activated by the fabric interconnect. Rebooting the fabric interconnect on a failed IOM update does not fix this issue. | Resolved in Cisco UCS, Release 2.0(4b). Upgrade to Release 2.0(4b). Contact Cisco technical support if you have any issues upgrading to this release. |
| CSCuh61202 | FC storage traffic through an IOM stops when the IOM is reset or reinserted, or the cable between the IOM and FI is removed or reinserted. | To avoid being impacted when upgrading from a release prior to 2.1(3a) or 2.2(1b), upgrade the server firmware  **before** performing an infrastructure upgrade.  This caveat affects FC traffic on the Cisco 1240, Cisco 1280, and Cisco M81KR adapters and is an exception to the normal upgrade procedures found in  [Cisco UCS Manager upgrade guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/ucs-manager/products-installation-guides-list.html).  For more details, please refer to  [CSCuh61202](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh61202). |

Table 35 Open Caveats in Release 2.0(4d)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCue41489 | When a server is associated to a service profile with a Maintenance Policy that requires user acknowledgement, under some conditions, on upgrade, the server might reboot without triggering the user acknowledgement. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc82212 | VMware ESX cold migration is slow.  The issue has been reproduced on various Cisco servers, including the B230M1 and B200M3), as well as on other server vendors’ hardware.  This issue does not occur on the Cisco B200M2 server. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc82601 | All IOMs connected to a fabric interconnect disconnect, but the peer IOMs do not go down.  This causes complete path failure on the side of the failure. | Graceful recovery occurs after about 15 seconds. Reboot any servers which were affected to restore Fibre Channel connectivity. |
| CSCuc87547 | PSU failures of a Cisco Nexus 2232 FEX configured for a C-series server that is managed by Cisco UCS Manager may be continuously reported by Cisco UCS Manager. | This is a cosmetic issue with no known workaround. Reloading the FEXes may or may not correct this issue. |
| CSCuc88168 | The fabric interconnect reboots upon SNMP crash. | If you are running a version of Cisco UCSM Manager lower than Cisco UCS 2.0(1t), see CSCtt99770.  Disabling SNMP on the fabric interconnect may help prevent a recurrence of the issue. |
| CSCuc91844 | A boot profile is configured with two iSCSI boot vNICs. However, iBFT is posted only for one of the boot vNICs. Therefore, the host boots up with only one path to the LUN. As a result, Microsoft MPIO will only see a single path and additional redundant paths cannot be added for fault tolerance. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc94895 | Cisco UCS 2104XP IOM reboots abruptly for unknown reason. | Contact Cisco TAC to have the IOM replaced. |
| CSCud10901 | A B420-M3 blade server with 48 x 32G DIMMs fails discovery and generates a fault. | This issue has no known workaround. However, it occurs very rarely and if it happens, discovery is triggered again and completes successfully.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |
| CSCud27494 | Traffic to a blade server is dropped when an uplink is shutdown either on the fabric interconnect or from the upstream switch. The traffic is forwarded to the fabric interconnect on the other working link but the fabric interconnect does not forward the traffic to the vNIC. | Do one of the following:   * Initiate a connection from the server or VM. * Clear the ARP entry on the gateway to force an ARP broadcast. The fabric interconnect will forward that broadcast.   Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |
| CSCud36129 | Intel Enhanced Speedstep option is configured as disabled. However, when you verify the BIOS settings, the configuration did not take effect and the Intel Enhanced Speedstep option shows as enabled. | This issue has no known workaround.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |
| CSCud54919 | On blade servers that are not associated with a service profile, CIMC could not respond from UCS Manager at the same time. | Do the following:  **1.** Decommission the server.  **2.** Remove the blade and then reinsert it.  **3.** Reacknowledge the server.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |

| CSCuc44209 | Cisco UCS Manager displays the names for PSUs connected to a Cisco Nexus 2200 Series FEX in reverse order. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc47311 | When a Cisco UCS chassis using DC power supplies (PSU) abruptly loses power to the PSUs, the PSUs may exhibit a RED LED Fail status after power is restored. | Remove and reinsert the PSUs. |
| CSCuc52981 | Downloading licence files for the Cisco UCS 6100 and 6200 Series fabric interconnects appears to complete successfully, but the license files are not visible. | Obtain a single license file with all licenses consolidated, and use that license file to license the fabric interconnects. |
| CSCuc58056 | “Inventory is not complete” errors received after displaying FI inventory. | This issue has no known workaround.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |
| CSCuc59299 | When downloading a firmware bundle, ethpm crashes with 'Out of Memory: Killed process' error and the fabric interconnect reboots. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc59306 | When members are disabled (simulating failure) leaving one link active from the port-channel between the Cisco UCS 6248UP FI and the Cisco UCS 2208XP FI, all I/O for both the A side and B side of the vFC interface pauses for approximately 45-60 seconds. | Switch the chassis discovery policy and connectivity policy from “port-channel” to “none”, then reacknowledge the chassis. |
| CSCuc59752 | The  **snmptable** command does not return any values. | This issue has no known workaround.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |
| CSCuc65457 | The svc\_sam\_bladeAG service crashes and creates a core dump. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc68863 | Newly installed 8 GM DIMM shows as “Equipped Identity Unestablishable” and “invalid FRU” in Cisco UCS Manager. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc72049 | When creating an access mode appliance port-channel in Cisco UCS Manager, the default VLAN is used instead of the specified VLAN. Changing the port-channel VLAN to the originally specified VLAN programs the port-channel correctly in NX-OS, but the individual members are not changed. This can result in communication issues where the port-channel and MAC addresses are discovered on the incorrect VLAN. | Configure the appliance port-channel in trunk mode with native vLAN specified instead of access mode. |
| CSCuc76238 | Authenticated but unauthorized users are able to perform operations that should not be allowed. These operations include service profile instantiation from template and service profile cloning. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc82601 | All IOMs connected to a fabric interconnect experienced a link flap while the peer IOMs remained connected. | Recovery occurs automatically within 15 seconds. Reboot any servers that are still experiencing connection issues to resume FC connectivity. |
| CSCuc82895 | When downgrading Cisco UCS Manager from Release 2.0(4b) to earlier releases, for example, Release 2.0(3c), Release 1.4.4, or Release 1.3.1, the license count displayed and available might incorrectly be greater than the licenses you have obtained. | This issue has no known workaround.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |

| CSCtr45130 | After upgrading Cisco UCS Manager from Release 1.4.(1j) to 1.4(2b), when you activate, it causes the blade server to reboot. | Before beginning the upgrade, change the maintenance policy to “user-ack”/“scheduled” to defer or control any blade reboot. |
| CSCtz03288 | Hard drives from one manufacturer are two to three times slower than the hard drives from another manufacturer even though both are sold under the same product ID. This issue is observed with 300 GB SAS 10K RPM SFF drives. | Use the correct LSI driver. |
| CSCtz36973 | After upgrading the Cisco UCS Manager from Cisco UCS Release 1.4(3m) to 2.0(2m) release, Cisco UCS Manager alerts a few warning messages to all the associated service profiles and the vNICs configured for these service profiles. Check if there are issues on the vNICs, the uplinks, and the VLANs. If there are no issues, these messages are not harmful to the network connectivity. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtz44130 | After upgrading from Cisco UCS 2.0(2m) to 2.0(2q) release, a few false positive thermal alerts cause the chassis fans to spool up to full speed. | Reseat the I/O modules to clear the alerts. |
| CSCtz76897 | While upgrading or discovering Cisco UCS Manager, when the chassis discovery policy is changed to the set link-aggregation-pref port-channel policy, it creates the port-channel and the FEX is offline for approximately 40 seconds. | After changing the chassis discovery policy, shut down the system and reacknowledge the chassis. Verify that the FEX port-channel has been created. |
| CSCtz86513 | After sending an inventory message from Cisco UCS Manager, no registration email is received from the SCH Portal. Devices are registered on the SCH portal but the new inventory messages are not logged and the cases do not get created. The Contact field in the Contact information section contains a < or > character. | Remove the > and < from the SCH configuration fields in Cisco UCS Manager. |
| CSCtz87024 | Fibre Channel firmware issues disconnect the SAN and cause a server outage. | Reboot the SAN multiple times to restore the connectivity. |
| CSCtz87068 | After upgrading from Cisco CUS Release 1.4(3i) to 2.0(1w), a false alert about a conflicting VLAN ID is observed on the VLAN. Deleting the conflicting VSAN does not clear the critical fault on the VLAN. | Change the VLAN ID on the conflicting VLAN to a different value and then reset it to the previous value. |
| CSCtz88815 | The auto core transfer failure fault does not get cleared from the Cisco UCS Manager GUI. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtz88841 | Cisco UCS Manager generates a false VIF Down alarm even though the VIF is active on the fabric interconnect. | Reset the DCE interface from Cisco UCS Manager for the VIF for which the false alarm is generated. |
| CSCtz93271 | Some VFC interfaces are disabled with an error message after rebooting the fabric interconnect. | Reset the DCE interfaces on the affected adapters and ports. |
| CSCtz99909 | When a new BIOS policy is created with the C1E state set to disabled from Cisco UCS Manager, the ESX displays the C1E state as enabled. The BIOS setup menu displays that the C1E is disabled as BIOS policy from Cisco UCS Manager. | Use it as a default policy. |
| CSCtz99795 | When two Cisco UCS domains push the same VLAN profile, the port profile from one Cisco UCS domain disappears. | Modify the maximum port in the port profile of the first Cisco UCS domain and save the configuration. The port profiles are now displayed in both Cisco UCS domains. |
| CSCua63323 | Under low resource conditions, poor performance of PALO Microsoft Exchange DAG causes RQ drop. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCub34427 | When adding a VLAN to a vNIC, under certain circumstances the server reboots unexpectedly. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCub51662 | When upgrading the firmware to Cisco UCS Release 2.0, the IPMI commands/queries fail to get data from a B-series server. | Reboot CIMC.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(4a). |
| CSCub59614 | Adding a global VLAN to Cisco UCS Manager causes some VIFs to fail. | This issue has no known workaround. |

### The following caveats were found in Release 2.0(2q)

Table 43 Open Caveats in Release 2.0(2q)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCua31267  CSCtx65534 | Deleting a VLAN in the fabric interconnect causes the vNICs that are carrying that VLAN to flap. On deletion of one VLAN on a vNIC, traffic disruption is observed on the other VLAN. | Remove the VLANs from all the vNICs/vNIC templates and the uplinks before deleting the VLANs from a fabric interconnect. |
| CSCub64088 | When you replace a SFP only on the IOM, UCS Manager does not update the new SFP serial number. Continues to display the old SFP serial number. | Decommission the chassis once to recommission and update the SFP serial number. |
| CSCtu16549 | Memory DIMMs in a Cisco UCS blade may be marked as “Equipped Identity Unestablishable” if they are disabled during the power on self test. They do not have their smbios data filled in with the actual vendor data. Instead the vendor data in the smbios data is shown as “NO DIMM.” | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtx96556 | The fabric interconnect to I/O module link does not come up, or it experiences a high degree of packet CRC errors when using gen-2 10 or 7 meter twinax active cable and the 2204XP or 2208XP I/O module. This problem more likely to manifest with uplink number 3 as shown in an NX-OS CLI  **show interface fex-fabric** command. | Use fiber cable or 5 meter twinax cable instead. |
| CSCty83359 | Blades reboot silently on doing any configuration change on the service profile after upgrading the Board Controller and CIMC firmware images using host firmware package and management firmware package. This is seen on B250 blades (N20-B6620-2, N20-B6625-2) when CIMC & Blade controller are updated at the same time, provided the CIMC running version is between 1.4.0 and 1.4.3s or 2.0 and 2.0.1t. These version ranges do not support board controller firmware upgrade on the above specified models. In the first association, boardControllerUpdate will get skipped if CIMC version does not support it. Any further change on the SP will reevaluate the SP and will find out that a board controller-update needs to be done and will trigger it. | Check if your current CIMC firmware version is one of the above specified ones. If yes then first upgrade your CIMC firmware to version which supports Board-controller-firmware-upgrade (i.e 1.4.3t and later and 2.0.1u and later). Once your CIMC gets upgraded then trigger Board Controller upgrade. Note that this will reboot the blade. |
| CSCty83542 | During normal operation of an IOM, a kernel panic occurs and the IOM reboots and returns to normal operation. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCty91945 | If a fabric interconnect or IOM is used for migrating VMs hosted on a Red Hat 6.2 KVM server is rebooted during VM migration, the VM migration will not complete until the IOM or fabric interconnect comes back on line. This occurs if the IOM or fabric interconnect reboots while VM migration is in progress. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCty93821 | Server discovery fails when Cisco UCS Manager is not able to communicate with an adapter during the identification phase. | Reacknowledge or reseat the server. |
| CSCty95396 | If a server is configured to boot from an iSCSI LUN, then disabling the primary and failover NIC from the host OS will result in the host losing its connection to its boot disk which can lead to a host OS panic or BSOD. This occurs when both the primary and failover vNICs are disabled from the host OS. | Do not disable the failover iSCSI vNIC from the host OS. |
| CSCtz15271 | There is a mismatch between the BIOS token settings definitions for “WatchdogTimerTimeout” and the actual BIOS settings on the server. | For releases prior to 2.0.(3), launch the KVM Console and update the “vpOSBootWatchdogTimerPolicy” setting. |
| CSCtz16082 | A server running ESX can only disable C1E when using the default BIOS policy. Once a new BIOS policy is created with C1E disabled from Cisco UCS Manager, ESX does not recognize C1E as disabled while BIOS setup menu and C-state dump from EFI all show C1E is disabled in the BIOS policy from Cisco UCS Manager. So as long as the policy is either set to default (not set) or a custom default (platform default), the problem is not seen. | Leave the policy on the default settings. |
| CSCua50442 | Third party tools such as demicode, IPMItool etc. may not parse the entire product information for the B-series server. If it does parse, you may see non-printable ASCII characters, blank or replacement ASCII characters in the Type/Version field. | Contact Cisco TAC. |
| CSCua68423 | Under some conditions, when you add/remove a port in a port channel, you will see ENM core. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCub54167 | A Cisco UCS B230 M1 blade server fails the upgrade process during the storage service profile association. | Reacknowledge the blade after the BIOS upgrade is completed. |

### The following caveats were found in Release 2.0(2m)

Table 44 Open Caveats in Release 2.0(2m)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCug63368 | Misconfiguring the gateway IP with DHCP relay agent IP instead of vPC HSRP IP can cause PXE boot fail in VPC environment with some operating system configuration. | Clear ARP entry on both vPC peers. Configure the host to use different IP address on OS from lease assigned to adapter. |
| CSCub71579 | A blade server with VIC 1240 or VIC 1280 adapter may lose network connectivity under heavy FCoE load. | Enable 4 or more QoS system classes to avoid this issue. |
| CSCtz07684 | Boot order in BIOS setup or F6 menus still show Local HDD even after removing Local Disk option in Cisco UCS Manager service profile. This is seen when the boot order is configured by Cisco UCS Manager service profile with PXE eth0, PXE eth1, iSCSI iscsi0, iSCSI iscsi1, Local HDD. If you decide to remove the Local HDD option by deleting it from the boot policy service profile, after server rebooting, the boot order still shows Local HDD in BIOS boot order list. This behavior does not effect booting to PXE and iSCSI devices in the order configured. | Disable Local HDD manually using the following steps:  **1.** Boot blade.  **2.** Press F2 key when message is displayed during BIOS POST.  **3.** Wait until BIOS completes its POST and invokes Setup utility.  **4.** Select the Boot Options tab.  **5.** Move the cursor down to Hard Drive BBS Priority and press enter to select this option.  **6.** Move cursor to hard drive that user want to disable and press enter to configure the drive.  **7.** Move cursor to Disabled option and press enter to disable the drive.  **8.** Save and reboot the blade. |
| CSCtz01783 | Under some rare circumstances, issuing NX-OS CLI  **show fex detail** command after an I/O module goes offline and online may cause a fabric interconnect to reload. | Use the **show fex**  *fex id*  **detail** command instead. |
| CSCty62153 | After an extended period of fabric port flapping configurations on border ports are missing. | Reboot the fabric interconnect. |
| CSCty62129 | When an IOM goes offline, in some cases the forwarding resource is not freed. When the IOM comes back online, some VM-FEX interfaces may not be able to come up. This requires the chassis connectivity mode be port-channel, and only applies to the case when there are close to 1000 VM-FEX interfaces on the same chassis. | Change the chassis connectivity mode to non port-channel and re-acknowledge the chassis will recover. |
| CSCty36381 | In very rare circumstances, an uplink on UCS-2208XP or 2204-XP may experience a rapid link up/down (less than 250 ms interval). This may result in the fabric interconnect side of the link being in link down state but the IOM side of the link being in an up state. | The server port can be disabled and re-enabled to recover. |
| CSCtw59783 | LEDs for ports 1 and 2 on a Cisco UCS 6296 behave differently than other ports. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCty23519 | On a UCS 6120 or 6140 fabric interconnect with 20 chassis, some Cisco UCS Manager processes such as svc\_sam\_dme and svc\_sam\_bladeAG crash with the following message:  %KERN-1-SYSTEM\_MSG: Proc svc\_sam\_dme (5082) with Total\_VM 706000 KB Resident\_Mem 544156 KB Anon\_Resident\_Mem 501068 KB being killed due to lack of memory - kernel     This issue is only seen after repeated reack, association, disassociation, decommission, and recommission of the chassis in a fully populated testbed. | This issue has no known workaround. The processes are restarted automatically. |
| CSCty94457 | A Windows Server 2008 baremetal host loses all network configuration and sees a NIC numbering shift. For example if Windows Device Manager showed NIC 1,2,3,4 before the upgrade, after upgrade, NIC 6,7,8,9 will be created. The “new” hardware will have lost all previous configuration such as IP address, DNS server, etc. This occurs after upgrading the Cisco UCS blade adapter card firmware to 2.0(2m). This has only been observed on the Microsoft Windows 2008 (“2k8”) operating system on B230 (M1 or M2 blades) and B440 with the Cisco VIC M81KR adapter card. On Cisco C-Series servers this issue has been seen on C260 and C460 servers, also running Windows 2008 R2. This has not been observed on any other supported operating systems such as ESXi, or Red Hat Linux. | Downgrading adapter to previous version reverts the NICs back to the expected numbering with configuration intact. Upgrading the adapter firmware images to Cisco UCS Release 2.0(2q) for M81KR and Cisco UCS Release 2.0(2i) for P81E adapters will also maintain the pre-upgrade NIC configuration. |
| CSCtr61016 | The Cisco UCS Manager GUI hangs while retrieving data for the performance statistics table. | Allow the Cisco UCS Manager GUI to completely retrieve the data, then close the current Cisco UCS Manager GUI session and re-launch. |
| CSCtx66152 | Configuring a RAID policy on a rack-mount server using an ICH10R controller fails. | After Cisco UCS Manager association completes, reset the system and configure RAID directly using the LSI Option ROM. This requires that there is no scrub policy in place in the service profile. This is to avoid deletion of RAID volumes in subsequent association operations. |
| CSCtk03135 | If recovery is initiated for a blade with a corrupted BIOS, there is a chance that recovery will hang. This occurs approximately once in 20-30 trials. | Restart the recovery process to repair the corrupted BIOS. This issue occurs infrequently enough that a simple restart should be enough to resolve it. |
| CSCtx49701 | When the BIOS setup is controlled by Cisco UCS Manager, the option to press F9 to load BIOS defaults in the BIOS menu is still active, which could change BIOS setup such that BIOS setup in the Cisco UCS Manager service profile might conflict with actual BIOS setup. | Do not press F9 to load BIOS defaults while in BIOS setup menu. Always control the settings via the Cisco UCS Manager service profiles. |
| CSCtu34607 | Changing the dynamic vNIC policy to change the number of vNICs may cause static vNICs to get reordered on PCIe bus. This is seen under the following conditions:  **1.** Create a Service Profile with Dynamic vNIC policy with count set to less than 50.  **2.** Create static vNICs required for ESX nk connectivity in HA setup.  **3.** Associate to server. Check the vNIC PCIe bus orders as seen by Host OS.  **4.** Increase the dynamic vNIC count to go past 56.  **5.** You would see PCIe orders of static vNICs are changed in Host OS.  **6.** Create static vNICs and then create dynamic vNICs. Either create the dynamic vNIC policy with count less than 50 or greater than 56. | There is no known workaround. |
| CSCtz07798 | Under certain conditions, a service profile will generate a configuration failure and a blade that it is associated with is removed from the server pool. This condition can cause service profile re-association to other available blades in the pool. | If a service profile is displaying this condition, re-assign the blade from the server pool to the physical blade by running following command from the Cisco UCS Manager CLI to avoid an outage:  F340-31-9-1-B  **scope org**  F340-31-9-1-B /org #  **scope service-profile server 1/8**  F340-31-9-1-B /org/service-profile #  **associate server 1/8**  F340-31-9-1-B /org/service-profile\* #  **commit-buffer**  F340-31-9-1-B /org/service-profile # |

### The following caveats were found in Release 2.0(1x):

Table 45 Open Caveats in Release 2.0(1x)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCub40588 | “Waiting for FLOGI” error persists after FLOGI succeeds and the VFC comes up. | Reset the VHBA from Cisco UCS Manager to clear the state and the associated fault. |
| CSCtx90742 | All other connections are showing up and statistics look normal except a VM itself is still not receiving traffic. This is seen when the VM’s vNIC is marked as masked in the VIF list. In this condition, it will not receive traffic. | Reset the vNIC from vclient. |
| CSCty91471 | The fabric interconnect rebooted with the following error during upgrade of fabric interconnect firmware to version 2.0(1x):  Reason: Kernel Panic  System version: 5.0(3)N2(2.1w)  Service: | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCty59362 | VFC interfaces remain down and all static veths are stuck in the CR\_RE state after a full-state restore. Servers may not work properly after the full-state restore operation if the existing server's configuration does not match the configuration in the backup file used for the restore. This is because Cisco UCS Manager does not automatically reconfigure the servers after the restore operation. | When restoring using a backup file that was exported from a different system, it is strongly recommended that you use a system that has the same hardware including fabric interconnects, servers, adapters and IOM or FEX connectivity. Mismatched hardware may lead to the restored system not fully functioning. In case that there is a mismatch between the IOM/FEX links or servers on the two systems, you should acknowledge the chassis and/or servers accordingly after the restore operation. |
| CSCtt24695 | Sometimes FEX host facing ports are not created/discovered in Cisco UCS Manager at the end of chassis/server discovery. This results in Cisco UCS Manager assuming that the adapter has connectivity to only one fabric. So that blade server cannot be used to associate with a service profile which has vNICs that require both fabric or the fabric to which connectivity is not yet discovered. This happens very rarely during chassis and server discovery. | Re acknowledge the server (or chassis) so that Cisco UCS Manager attempts discovery once again. |
| CSCtw59592 | In a server using both a virtualized adapter card and a nonvirtualized card, if there are fewer service profile vNICS than the minimum required physical NIC ports then extraneous NIC ports are generated due to Cisco UCS Manager restrictions. (The minimum number of physical ports is 0 for Cisco UCS M81KR, 2 for other non-virtualized cards). This happens in the following circumstances:  **1.** Full width blade server with a UCS M81KR and a UCS NIC M51KR-B or UCS CNA M72KR-Q adapter card.  **2.** Single adapter of UCS CNA M72KR-Q with a service profile having one NIC and one HBA will still show 2 NIC and HBA on the OS side.  **3.** A number of vNICs were created and implicit vNIC placement was selected, so that the number of vNICs to be load-distributed on a non-virtualized adapter was less than the minimal physical NIC ports (2). The system internally creates the 2nd NIC to match to its network connectivity requirement.  **4.** Once the host OS boots up, it will see an extraneous vNIC being placed on non-virtualized adapter  **5.** No data traffic is allowed on the additional vNIC. | In a mixed adapter setup, explicitly place the vNICs on the non-virtualized adapter first and then place them on the virtualized adapter. Alternately, create at least 4 static vNICs & 4 HBAs when using dual slot blades in an HA setup. |
| CSCty47746 | Under some rare circumstances, a hot removal and insertion of an IO module results in a timeout of backplane port creation. | Re acknowledge the chassis. |
| CSCtw67182 | A blade with a UCS M81KR adapter shows the error “initialize error 1" during iSCSI boot. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCty27581 | Any action on a trunked port-channel (such as link, enable or disable) from the Cisco UCS Manager GUI takes a long time (over 2 minutes) to reflect on CLI. Once ports are up, they show as trunking, however vSANs are stuck in initializing. | Use individual links instead of Fabric Port Channel. |
| CSCty26754 | Blades power off unexpectedly, and stay off. A shallow discovery has happened which puts the blade into its desired power state. Some examples of actions that can trigger a shallow discovery are:   * Loss of any link between the FI and the IOM * Reset of an IOM * Killing a process with debug plugin * Re-acknowledge of a chassis   Blades that have been powered on with the following methods will be left in this inconsistent power state:   * Pressing the physical power button on the front * Clicking the reset button on the server in the equipment tab * Right clicking the server in the list of servers on the equipment tab and selecting reset. | When a blade is powered off, only use the Power On button on the General tab to turn on the blade. If the service-profile has a desired power state of Off, but the blade is actually On, click the Set Desired Power State button that will appear on the General tab of the service-profile and change the desired power state to On. The Set Desired Power State button will disappear when the desired and actual power states match. Under the Status Details drop down, the Desired Power State will be changed to Up. |
| CSCtx95937 | When you create a vNIC template under the LAN tab a VM-FEX Port-profile is automatically created under the VM tab. This port-profile under the VM tab is created as a convenience for VM-FEX users. | If you are not using VM-FEX you can safely delete the port-profile. Re-create the vNIC template without checking the VM checkbox or delete the port-profiles that are generated when you edit the VLAN list. |

| CSCuh22023 | The data management engine (DME) might be killed by the sam\_controller due to replication failure between the FIs. | If the DME is being killed continuously, restart the FI or enter the following commands:  **1.**  PMON STOP  **2.**  PMON START |
| CSCug93912 | When connected to a Cisco UCS 6120XP Fabric Interconnect, the UCS Manager GUI might fail to start. The Cisco UCS Manager CLI functions correctly and displays the following error:  Fabric Interconnect A, management services have failed. | Reboot the FI. |
| CSCtt94543 | While accessing the fabric interconnect via SSH, the SSHD process sometimes crashes during the steady state if there is an SSH authentication failure. | This issue has no known workaround. |

### The following caveats were found in Release 2.0(1s):

Table 48 Open Caveats in Release 2.0(1s)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCug89448 | The tech support collection fails on the Cisco UCS Manager GUI. The process starts, but does not complete. | Use the  show tech-support command in the Cisco UCS Manager CLI. |
| CSCug59101 | FI crashes due to HAP reset triggered by NTP process crash. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCuc15009 | Under some conditions, the IOM upgrade fails and gets into a continuous reboot after the IOM is activated by the fabric interconnect. Rebooting the fabric interconnect on a failed IOM update does not fix this issue. | Contact Cisco TAC. |
| CSCub53747 | The Power Consumed column on the Power Groups tab in the Cisco UCS Manager GUI displays “0” for the chassis or blades in the default power group. | Create a new power group and move the chassis to that power group. The Power Consumed column will be updated. You can then delete the new power group to move the chassis back to the default power group. |
| CSCtu16375 | If you try to download core files from the Cisco UCS Manager GUI, the following error messages appear: “Failed to download file... reason: Server return http response code 401........" This is seen when Google analytics is enabled. | Disable Google analytics. |
| CSCts48719 | The KVM application does not take keyboard inputs in windowed mode. This happens when the UCSM/KVM is run on a Linux Client. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtx12353 | After a VLAN mapping change, a vNIC in ENM source pin will fail. | Change the mapping of the named VLAN default from 1 to 2 to 1. |
| CSCtw96111 | A virtual machines using VM-FEX (Dynamic vNIC) port-profiles loses network connectivity. This occurs on ESX/ESXi 4.1 U2 with Cisco UCS B-Series blades running Cisco VIC adapter cards. Some VMs (but not necessarily all) that are connected to the VM-FEX port-profile will lose connectivity. The VM guest OS may or may not show as disconnected. | Rebooting both fabric interconnects will restore connectivity. |
| CSCtx35808 | E2E diagnostic test was not using as much memory as possible depending on blade memory configuration. The test was updated to use as much memory as possible without running out of memory. This test is only available in manufacturing and if a blade is taken out of normal operation to run host diagnostic tests. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtu14851 | If port profiles are configured for VM-FEX, the fabric interconnect may crash during upgrade due to a heartbeat failure. | Delete port profiles using the VM tab in the Cisco UCS Manager GUI prior to upgrade |
| CSCtw97157 | When following the steps in the Cisco upgrade guide and activating the subordinate fabric interconnect, guest virtual machines will experience a high CPU load but no other performance problems. | Try one of the three known workarounds:  **1.** Reboot the blade while the BIOS and adapter firmware is on previous version.  **2.** Finish upgrade with host firmware package to upgrade BIOS and adapter firmware.  **3.** Migrate the affected VM to another host. |
| CSCts56107 | On a Service Profile (SP) configuration change, a server is rebooted before the maintenance window. This will happen if you make some configuration change on the SP which does not require a reboot. Then immediately make another change which requires a blade reboot. The blade will reboot immediately. | Please wait for the shallow association to complete and then do further changes on the SP. |

| CSCtr30372 | In the Cisco UCS Manager GUI, a power cycle with graceful operating system shutdown does not shutdown the operating system gracefully. | Using the Cisco UCS Manager GUI, execute the server power cycle in two steps. First, shutdown the server with graceful operating system shutdown option selected. Then boot the server up after clicking the Boot server option. |
| CSCtx23541 | After specifying an attribute setting in either the “General” LDAP setting or under the LDAP Provider setting, LDAPD crashes when testing LDAP. This happens with both the Cisco UCS Manager CLI and GUI. | Remove all Attribute configuration in both the “General” LDAP setting and LDAP Provider setting. |
| CSCtr62641 | Currently in Cisco UCS Manager there is no auto-creation of IQN identifiers for iSCSI. IQNs must be manually entered for each iSCSI adapter. There is also no validation on the IQN format. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtz03288 | Hard drives sourced from one manufacturer are two to three times slower than hard drives from another manufacturer even though both are sold under the same product id. This is seen with 300 GB SAS 10K RPM SFF drives. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtr10869 | During upgrade from Cisco UCS 1.4 to 2.0, an SSLCert error may be written to the log files. | This issue has no known workaround. This is harmless and has not been found to impact functionality. |
| CSCtq30308 | After kernel rebuild or update a server configured for SAN Boot of RHEL 5.6 or RHEL 5.7 may fail to boot. This is a Red Hat issue, and ticket 744330 has been filed. It is a private ticket that may be referenced when calling Red Hat support for more information. | To recover the server, modify the /etc/modprobe.conf file to add the new entry “alias scsi\_hostadapter2 fnic”. Also, if you have the entry “alias scsi\_hostadapter2 usb-storage”, modify it to: “alias scsi\_hostadapter3 usb-storage”. |
| CSCtt41541 | While upgrading to Cisco UCS Release 2.0 with QoS policies defined, critical errors will be displayed for all QoS policies and VIFs with QoS policies defined on them will be down after upgrading the subordinate interconnect but before upgrading the primary fabric interconnect. Expect that during the upgrade there will be a period of downtime between when the primary restarts and when the secondary becomes primary and brings up its VIFs. During this time all blades will lose their connectivity to both LAN and SAN. | Completing the upgrade to Cisco UCS Release 2.0 by upgrading the primary interconnect will clear these faults. Alternatively you can remove all QoS policies from the affected interfaces, allowing them to come up, complete the upgrade and then reapply the QoS policies with no downtime. This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Release 2.0(1s). |
| CSCto59775 | A host configured for iSCSI boot will always boot off a LUN exported to the Primary iSCSI VNIC by default, as iBFT is always posted on the primary iSCSI vNIC. The secondary iSCSI vNIC will post iBFT in case the LUN discovery fails on the primary iSCSI vNIC. However, if the Secondary iSCSI vNIC comes up earlier than the Primary iSCSI vNIC (due to its overlay vNIC having a lower PCI order than that of the overlay vNIC for the Primary) and LUN discovery fails on the Primary, then there is no iBFT posted and the host fails to boot. | Ensure that the PCI order of the overlay vNIC for the Primary iSCSI vNIC is always lower than that of the overlay vNIC for the Secondary iSCSI vNIC. |
| CSCtl04744 | Network connectivity is affected (flapping on uplink ports) on both fabric interconnects during operations such as native VLAN change when the configuration change is done on both fabric interconnects at the same time. | Schedule a maintenance window to perform such configuration changes, and perform the changes separately. |
| CSCtt18526 | After upgrade to Cisco UCS 2.0(1m), blades with UCS M81KR adapters may show the error “initialize error 4” during FC boot. | Downgrade the adapter firmware to the previous version, or upgrade to Cisco UCS Release 2.0(1q). |
| CSCud71175 | When there is a single member port in a port channel, and an additional port is added to the fabric port channel, an HIF down event is triggered to accommodate the extra VNTAG space and provide extra VIF deployment. This occurs when the new link is added to same ASIC. The link will automatically be added and lead to the symptom. If the port is on a different ASIC, then the added link must be chassis-acknowledged. The symptom will be seen after the acknowledgement. | This issue has no known workaround. This is a rare situation that typically does not happen in a traditional port-channel deployment. |
| CSCud71227 | FWM crash and the switch reboots when you start with one link, add a second link on the same ASIC, then delete the second link and move it to a different chassis. | Acknowledge the chassis.  **Note** Acknowledging the chassis will cause traffic drop. |
| CSCud70315 | When a member of a port channel transitions between up and down states, there is a loss for traffic on the port channel, including fiber channel traffic. The throughput for fiber channel goes down and then recovers. This is caused by a SCSI time out and the recovery is triggered by the SCSI layer. The throughput may go down to 0 before recovery, but the application will not see any timeouts. | This issue has no known workaround. Proper SCSI timeout values help in recovery. |

## Known Limitations and Behaviors

### The following known limitations found in Release 2.0(5f) are not otherwise documented:

* On platforms with 00B storage controller, Cisco UCS Manager displays usable (coerced) value in disk inventory section, which is different than the raw 'NumberOfBlocks' value displayed in catalog section. This is a non-issue; Cisco UCS Manager is designed to report the coerced, or usable, size as reported by the LSI controller. Both the host and OOB interfaces report this same value.
* While upgrading from Release 2.0(2q) to 2.0(5a) or higher, the hosts cannot login to storage due to a conflict in the FCoE VLAN ID with one of the regular VLANs. The VLAN conflict is not a supported configuration and it should be fixed prior to the upgrade.
* After the firmware upgrade from Release 1.4(3m) to any later release, vMotion fails due to AES-NI bit difference. As a workaround, disable the OEM AESNI control in BIOS for the blade that is upgraded. Once this feature is disabled and the blade is booted to ESXi, vMotion is allowed to proceed between the two hosts without any issues.

### The following known limitations found in Release 2.0(5a) are not otherwise documented:

* Single chassis set up might generate an error with a warning message on accessing shared storage. This might have an impact on system’s service when the fabric interconnect fails. In a multiple chassis set up, this might not cause an issue, except in IOM firmware upgrade. If this error does not clear or re occurs, do one of the following: (CSCtu17144)

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Reboot the IO module.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Remove and re-seat the IO module, making sure module is firmly in contact with the backplane.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do not upgrade IOM firmware until this error is cleared.

---

### The following known limitations found in Release 2.0(3a) are not otherwise documented:

* The 2.0(3d).T catalog is not backward compatible with Release 2.0(2) or Release 2.0(1).
* The IOM reset CMC process does not complete due to an inoperable IOM. Replacing the IOM with a new IOM does not clear the state for a long time and the new IOM does not come up. This issue occurs when the reset CMC process is issued to an IOM that the Cisco UCS Manager cannot communicate with.
* The PLOGI frames can get dropped in the fabric interconnect and as a result, the hosts do not have a path to the LUNs. This issue was observed only once while adding the additional chassis to the fabric interconnect.
* When an Ethernet border port failure occurs, the host ports are repinned to a new border port. This issue could cause a few FCoE frames to be dropped. This issue is observed on a failover from one Ethernet border port to another and it can be noticed only when there is a high rate of the FCoE traffic. This is a transient issue and it recovers immediately.
* While downgrading Cisco UCS Manager from Release 2.0(x) to Release 1.4(x) with CLI commands being issued, an svc\_sam\_dme core dump may occur along with a CLI command failure. This issue could occur due to the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When an image is activated through the GUI, CLI commands are issued.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When an image is activated through the CLI, CLI commands are issued from another CLI session.

To avoid this issue, do not issue CLI commands during the process of image activation.

### The following known limitations found in Release 2.0(2) are not otherwise documented:

* If upgrading from build 2.0(2m) to 2.0(2q), if you check the AES-NI control on B200 M2 and B250 M2 blades, the AES-NI setting value polarity reverses. The BIOS in build 2m defines the AES-NI NVRAM with 0 = disabled and 1 = enabled. The BIOS in build 2q defines the AES-NI NVRAM value with 0 = enabled and 1 = disabled.
* Whenever a 2232 FEX is decommissioned and re-commissioned, all the servers that are connected to that FEX must be re-acknowledged.
* During an upgrade from 2.0(1) to 2.0(2), duplicate IQNs are not allowed. Any duplicate IQNs statically entered will raise an alarm. This is seen in service profiles with duplicate IQNs assigned to multiple iSCSI vNICs. There are two fixes. One corrects the issue before the upgrade. The second fixes the issue assuming the upgrade has already been performed. Either fix will correct the issue.

 **Pre Upgrade:**

Modify any service profiles or service profile templates with iSCSI vNICs to have unique IQNs. Remove any duplicates. If necessary, use the PowerShell script provided in the upgrade notes to find out which iSCSI vNICs reuse the same iSCSI name.

 **Post Upgrade:**

 **a.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco UCS Manager will throw faults on iSCSI vNICs which have the shared IQN name.

 **b.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enter the  **show identity**  *iqn | include*  *iqnname* command to find which iSCSI vNIC has the IQN registered.

 **c.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Modify the iSCSI vNIC which is using the same IQN name but is not registered, and then edit the IQN name (manual or pooled).

 **d.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Make any change to the SP (ex:- Fw upgrade or modify description and so on.)

 **e.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Re-run the  **show identity**  *iqn | include Service Profile name*  command and make sure that the IQNs are registered in Cisco UCS Manager.

The details of the PowerShell script are provided in the troubleshooting and upgrade guide. (CSCty29247)

* At the end of installing ESXi 5.0 to an iSCSI LUN, an error message appears “expecting 2 boot bank, found 0". This message is not critical and a reboot of the system will start a normal boot of ESXi without any issues.
* Power-related BIOS options for C1E are disabled by default on a B200 M3.
* If the desired power state for a service profile associated with a blade server or an integrated rack-mount server is set to off, using the power button or Cisco UCS Manager to reset the server will cause the desired power state of the server to become out of sync with the actual power state and the server may unexpectedly shut down at a later time. To safely reboot a server from a power-down state, use the Boot Server action in the Cisco UCS Manager GUI.

### The following known limitations found in Release 2.0(1) are not otherwise documented:

Cisco UCS Manager

* When using the Windows VIRTIO driver in a virtual machine, Ethernet performance is low when compared to Linux based VMs in a Red Hat KVM environment. Windows does not currently support the LRO feature. To minimize performance impacts, disable GRO using the  **ethtool -K**   *interface*  **gro**  command. Disabling GRO may cause higher CPU utilization with TCP traffic.
* A bonded interface will not start as a slave if the MASTER value is in double quotes. You will not be able to create NIC teaming (channel bonding) with third-party adapters.
* The HDD fault monitoring feature cannot detect failures in all possible circumstances. The disk controller may report the disk as operable even though some blocks are marked Unknown. In this circumstance, RAID creation will fail. There is no workaround. ()
* When trying to configure an FC uplink or VSAN as an FC traffic monitoring source, an error message appears stating “Error creating mon-src-mysession. FC Port (1/29) cannot be configured as ingress SPAN source due to hardware limitation.” This only happens on Cisco UCS 6200 Fabric Interconnects. ASICs in these fabric interconnects do not allow a FC port or VSAN to be added as a SPAN (traffic monitoring session) source. There is no workaround. You can still can add a VFC as a source for an Ethernet traffic monitoring session. (
* When Cisco UCS Manager and fabric interconnect activation are done together, the switch upgrade can take longer than usual. This may happen when not following the published upgrade procedure. ()
* On an adapter configured with two iSCSI VNICs, only the iSCSI VNIC designated as primary in the boot order will post the discovered iSCSI LUN to the BIOS and write an iBFT entry to the host memory during boot. There is no workaround. (CSCtr51704)
* After an upgrade from a prior release to 2.0(1), a critical fault may be raised about an overlapping or matching FCoE VLAN ID used for a vSAN and an Ethernet VLAN ID under the same fabric as the FCoE VLAN. Raising a fault is the correct behavior under this circumstance. The fault can be avoided by changing either the FCoE VLAN ID or the Ethernet VLAN ID so that they have two different IDs prior to the upgrade. Resolving the problem after the upgrade may lead to down time for the system. See the  [Software Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/web/software/datacenter/ucs/UCS_2_0_Software_Advisory.htm). (
* When using Release 2.0, BIOS versions from the 1.4 software versions may be listed. If these versions are selected when attempting a BIOS recovery, the result is a system boot failure in B440 and B200 blades, the recovery may not complete, and the system may be permanently damaged or unrecoverable. You must choose to recover the BIOS to a BIOS version from the 2.0 software release. (
* Before you delete a VLAN from a fabric interconnect, ensure that the VLAN has been removed from all vNICs and vNIC templates. If you delete a VLAN that is assigned to a vNIC or vNIC template, the vNIC could allow that VLAN to flap.

OS

* If during RHEL 5.x installation to an iSCSI LUN on a blade with a Broadcom M51KR-B adapter RHEL 5.x does not detect the iSCSI LUN during OS installation, select the Broadcom M51KR-B port during the install and manually assign the initiator IP address, subnet mask, and gateway with the values from the service profile. ()

Fabric Interconnect

* When UCS is connected to an upstream Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch (running 4.2.4 version) using port-channels, and if the port channel is configured as LACP passive on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch side, it is possible that under high system stress situation, LACP may not be able to converge for the port channel. The workaround is to avoid native VLAN configuration change while system instability is in place or CPU utilization is high. Using LACP active on Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch also reduces the likelihood of the problem occurring.
* Per- packet Veth statistics for the UCS M81KR adapter are no longer supported, and will display as 0. Supported statistics are now packets, packets mcast, packets bcast, Bytes, and packets dropped.
* When SAN port channel or a HIF port channel has FC traffic flowing through them, any link flap in the port channel can cause the FC traffic to be impacted or lost. Even multipathing does not help the FC traffic to continue as the VFC is operationally up via the other links of the port channel. Traffic will recover after a short while, but increasing SCSI timer settings can help. ()

BIOS

* When the BIOS is upgraded on a B230-M1 blade from Release 2.0(1m) to Release 2.0(1q) or later, the PCI bus enumeration will shift by one bus number. This renumbering can cause certain operating systems such as VMware ESX or Windows to see the old vNICs and vHBAs with the new PCI address and could result in those interfaces being inoperable unless the configuration is changed in the OS. In case of ESX, a workaround is to edit the esx.conf with the new PCI address and to modify the vswitch configuration. This issue results from the resolution of Caveat CSCts86890, and affects only the upgrade of this specific server between these two specific releases. See the  [Software Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/web/software/datacenter/ucs/UCS_2_0_Software_Advisory.htm).

Upgrade and Downgrade Issues

* After downgrading from Cisco UCS Manager 2.0 to 1.4(1) or 1.4(2), the fabric interconnect can become unstable and fail to boot. This is usually due to having enabled features specific to release 2.0 that are not available in the earlier release and neglecting to disable those features before attempting the downgrade. In general, it is best to contact TAC and have them walk through a downgrade with you rather than attempt it unassisted.
* After upgrading from a 1.3.x to a 1.4.x or a later release, you might see the service profile configuration disappears from an organization. To confirm that this problem has occurred, use a CLI command that begins with  **show service-profile**. A NULL CLI output confirms the problem. This problem is most likely to occur if you created an organization with a space in its name while running a Cisco UCS Manager 1.0 release and then later upgraded Cisco UCS Manager to a 1.3.x release. In the 1.3.x release, spaces are not allowed in organization names and are automatically replaced with an underscore. If the system is subsequently upgraded to a 1.4.x or later release, the old organization name with a space reappears without the space to underscore conversion and all of its children (which includes service profiles, policies, and templates) are deleted. Note: An organization that was created in a Cisco UCS 1.3.x release or with a name that does not contain a space character will not have this problem.

To avoid this problem, do the following before upgrading from a 1.3.x release to a 1.4.x or a later release:

 1. Change the description field of the organizations that have underscores in their names by removing the underscores and any spaces to help keep the organizations in the database.

 2. Create a backup using the All Configuration option before upgrading. If a problem occurs after the upgrade, restore the configuration using the backup file. After importing the configuration file, reacknowledge all blades to restore their VIF status.

* Using any M3 server may require an upgrade to the IOM in the chassis. The third-generation adapter cards have the features that require a Cisco 2204 or 2208 IOM, and are not backward compatible with the Cisco 2104 IOM.

### Release 1.4(3)

### The following caveats were found in Release 1.4(3):

Table 52 Open Caveats in Release 1.4(3)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCui19367 | Config Import fsm fails with the following error:  Cannot create non-creatable object of class:commShellSvcLimits | Delete commShellSvcLimits from the configuration file and then re-import. |
| CSCtn84926 | MAC address-based port security for Emulex converged Network Adapters (N20-AE0102) is not supported. You configure MAC address-based port security through the network control policy in the service profile. When MAC address-based port security is enabled, the fabric interconnect restricts traffic to packets that contain the MAC address that it first learns. This is either the source MAC address used in the FCoE Initialization Protocol packet, or the MAC address in an ethernet packet, whichever is sent first by the adaptor. This configuration can result in either FCoE or Ethernet packets being dropped. | Disable MAC security on the service profile. |
| CSCty90643 | The DME process on one fabric interconnect frequently crashes when the peer fabric interconnect is in an inoperable state. | Resolve the issue with the fabric interconnect in the inoperable state and the DME on the other fabric interconnect will become stable. |
| CSCtx41463 | A fabric interconnect reboots unexpectedly. Using the  **show system reset-reason** command returns “Reset triggered due to HA policy of Reset.” | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCty05262 | PAA for a SPAN session does not works with 8Gb transceivers and Fibre Channel expansion modules on the fabric interconnect. | Upgrade to Cisco UCS Release 2.0(1t). |
| CSCts53607 | When a UCS M81KR or UCS M71KR-E/Q (NIV) adaptor is used, and the isolated host is communicating using a MAC configured in the service profile (and registered at the interconnect via a VIC) PVLAN traffic does not flow for an isolated host. Using the  **show platform fwm info hw-stm**  command at the NX-OS prompt shows that the isolated host MAC is learned on the isolated VLAN, but not learned on the primary VLAN. | This issue has no known workaround. You need to upgrade to Cisco UCS Release 2.0(1s). |
| CSCtu17091 | Blades unexpectedly reboot on Cisco UCS Manager activation when upgrading from Cisco UCS Release 1.3(1) to 1.4(3s). | Follow the upgrade path: Cisco UCS Manager 1.3(1x) -> 1.4(3r) then Cisco UCS Manager 1.4(3r) -> 1.4(3s). |
| CSCtu11613 | When an IOM reboots after a software update on a full width blade, the HIF ports on the second adapter are not brought up by the IOM. | Reboot the IOM. |
| CSCtr91923 | Thermal faults are confusing as they do not have meaningful details.  The causes for thermal conditions are:   * Threshold crossings of thermal sensors of IOM and blades. * Non availability of blade thermal sensor readings. * Loss of network connectivity between IOM and blades. * Faults in chassis fans and loss of cooling. | For threshold crossing of thermal sensors for IOM and blades, separate faults are raised. For other causes, collect IOM tech support and contact Cisco TAC. See the Cisco UCS troubleshooting guide for IOM tech support details. |
| CSCtu22052 | A BladeAg crash is observed if a request bios\_recovery\_ctrl message is sent to a blade, but the response came back too late and is ignored by mcclient. | None needed. BladeAg will restart. |

### Release 1.4(2)

### The following caveats were found in Release 1.4(2b):

Table 53 Open Caveats in Release 1.4(2b)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSCtq84985 | An Intel Westmere-EP CPU on a B200-M2 or B250-M2 blade may not be able to perform to its full extent when running a subset of 1.4.x BIOS versions. The BIOS may incorrectly initialize a value during boot up which keeps the CPU at P1 even when P0 is requested by an OS. | Please upgrade to the BIOS release for Cisco UCS Release 2.0(2m) to prevent this issue. |
| CSCtn09020 | If the installed DIMMs do not have thermal sensors (the most likely cause as this warning is logged during initial system memory initialization) or the installed DIMMs exceeded the thermal threshold values programmed in either the memory controller or the Memory buffer, then the RankMargintest file in the CIMC shows the following warning code:  MRC - Warning Code:0x9 on Socket#1 Br#0 Ch#00, Ddr#00, Dimm#00, Rank#FF (if applicable)  MRC - Warning Code:0x9 on Socket#1 Br#0 Ch#00, Ddr#01, Dimm#00, Rank#FF (if applicable) | This issue has no known workaround. The message is informational, and can be ignored. |

### Release 1.4(1)

### The following caveats were found in Release 1.4(1i):

Table 54 Open Caveats in Release 1.4(1i)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade | | |
| CSCub99354 | Under certain conditions, the VIC adapter fails after upgrade due to FRU corruption. | Contact Cisco TAC. |
| High Availability | | |
| CSCth17136 | High Availability does not become ready until all 3 selected HA devices (chassis/rack-unit) have been discovered. The condition that triggers this problem is the fact that a previously functioning and fully discovered device (either chassis or rack-mount server) has failed. This may be due to connectivity problems or faulty behavior. In this case the system remains in HA NOT READY state. | The root of the problem is a failed device. Fixing the problem in the device is the first step. If the failure is persistent the faulty device can be decommissioned to resolve the problem. |
| CSCth69032 | When Cisco UCS Manager is operated in High Availability mode, SNMP traps stop arriving as expected if the SNMP trap IP header source address field is set to the cluster virtual IP address. | SNMP trap recipients must not use the SNMP trap IP header source address, or be prepared for it to contain the management IP address of the currently primary fabric interconnect. |
| BIOS | | |
| CSCtk55618 | Blade and rack-mount servers that include unequal sized HDDs or SSDs have encountered various failures intermittently. Cisco UCS Manager reports “Error Configuring Local Disk Controller” in most cases during these failures, though other errors are also seen. | Verify that the servers use equal sized disks from the same vendor. This ensures that all of the disks are of identical disk capacity. |
| CSCtj67835 | The BIOS Setup shows less memory size and some DIMMs disabled on a B230. The SMBIOS table does not report memory info in Type 17 structure for the disabled DIMMs. The UCSM reports less memory size and some DIMMS disabled. This happens when the BIOS disables some DIMMs incorrectly when DIMMs on certain slots do not have the corresponding lockstep pairs installed. For example, configurations that can cause this failure include:  **1.** DIMM on slot C2 is not installed and slot C3 is installed - Causes DDR training failure that results in DIMM failure on slots C0,C1,C3,D0,D1,D2,D3.  **2.** DIMM on slot A1 is not installed - Disables DIMMs on slots A0, A2, A3. The NHM-EX CPU requires the DIMM0 in each DDR channel populated first before populating DIMM1 on that channel. This is an invalid configuration.  **3.** DIMM on slot B0 is not installed - Disables DIMMs on slots B1, B2, B3. The NHM-EX CPU requires the DIMM0 in each DDR channel populated first before populating DIMM1 on that channel. This is an invalid configuration. | Always populate the DIMMs in lockstep pairs, as described in the user documentation. The lockstep-ed DIMM slot pairs are A0 & A1, A2 & A3, B0 & B1, B2 & B3, C0 & C1, C2 & C3, D0 & D, and D2 & D3. Also, it is recommended to populate the DIMMs in the following order. Blue slot pairs, White slot pairs, Yellow slot pairs, Black slot pairs. |
| CIMC | | |
| CSCti94391 | When using mirroring mode, if a UCE error happens, there is a Redundancy SEL event and also a UCE SEL event. No other details are available for the Data Parity error. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| Adapters | | |
| CSCtj89468 | The link from the rack-mount server adapter to the fabric interconnect port remains down if the SFP type is FET (Fabric extender transceiver). Currently the FET type is supported only between a fabric extender and a fabric interconnect. If the SFP used for the link between the IOM and the rack-mount server adapter is an FET, the link will remain down. | Replace the SFP with one of the supported SFPs for rack-mount server adapters. |
| CSCtj82445 | CRC errors reported on an M81KR network interface on SLES 11 SP1. This is seen under High TX and RX traffic on SLES 11 SP1. The FIFO is not cleared as fast as it should because of some delays in the PCI path. An M81KR firmware devcmd storm from the host is also investigated to be one reason for the PCI stalls. These CRC errors are actually caused by FIFO overruns on the M81KR which are in turn caused by PCI stalls. They are not real CRC errors but truncated packets (due to FIFO overrun) flagged as CRC errors. | Reduce the traffic load to reduce the reported CRC errors. This assumes that the CRC errors in question are generated on M81KR and that there are no bad packets entering the adapter. |
| Cisco UCS Manager | | |
| CSCtr07696 | LicenseAG crashes during Cisco UCS Manager restart after downloading license files. | Erase these expiring license files from “/bootflash/license/downloaded/” through the debug plugin, and use a permanent license instead of a temporary license. |
| CSCtk97755 | Cisco UCS Manager takes a long time to push configurations containing large number of port-profiles to the VMware Virtual Center (VC). This happens when large number of hosts and virtual machines (VMs) are configured (for example, 500 VMs on 60 hosts managed by the same VC) and a large number of port-profiles are assigned to multiple DVSes in the VCenter. | Wait until the operations complete. Configuration FSM could take more than 30 minutes. Then, configure a smaller number of port-profiles. |
| CSCtk69231 | When 15 or more chassis are configured in release 1.4(1) and the system is downgraded to release 1.3(1), chassis beyond 14 are still there. This may cause some issues as the max chassis support enabled with the 1.3(1) release is 14. | Manually decommission chassis in the system to keep the total number of chassis to 14 before downgrading to release 1.3(1) from 1.4(1). |
| CSCtj18969 | When a rack-mount server has a local disk installed, it does not report real-time disk operability status (disk operability is reported as “N/A”). | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtj82918 | When the Cisco UCS Manager shell mode is set to s either management or local-management mode, the CLI command  **terminal monitor** is not available. | Use the  **terminal** command in NX-OS mode. |
| CSCtj62296 | The minimum power cap that can currently be set is 3400W. The chassis power cap has a lower limit of 3778 W (AC), which is internally converted to 3400 W (DC). | Do not enter a cap below this requirement. This requirement was derived from the need to safely allow a chassis to simultaneously boot all blades in a chassis. |
| CSCti87891 | The Cisco UCS Manager shell does not support redirection of  **show** command output to a remote file system. | Redirect the output to a local file in either  *workspace* : or  *volatile* : and then transfer the file to the remote system using the  **cp** command in local-mgmt mode. |
| CSCti86217 | In Cisco UCS Manager there is no option to change the port speed of the SPAN destination port. | Un-configure the SPAN destination port and make it an “uplink”. Change the port speed on the uplink port, then reconfigure the port as a SPAN destination port. The port speed will be at the value that user set for the “uplink” port. |
| CSCtj51582 | Cisco UCS Manager reports an unsupported DIMM as missing but does not raise a fault. | Verify that the DIMM is a Cisco DIMM supported on that server model. |
| Cisco UCS Manager GUI | | |
| CSCtj57838 | Non-disruptive pending changes may not be shown on a service profile. When a service profile has a maintenance policy that defers the application of disrupting changes to the server, user can see what changes are pending and make further changes. Disruptive pending changes are always visible on the service profile, whereas non-disruptive changes may not be shown. Non-disruptive pending changes are only shown for user convenience. This defect has no functional impact. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| Cisco UCS Manager CLI | | |
| CSCtj78998 | When VIF creation does not follow V-motion, NPPM does not move the VIF to a new dynamic and the stale VIF does not carry the traffic any more. This would cause the SPAN to stop monitoring the traffic from the original VM. | Re-discover the VMs and re-create the SPAN. |
| Fabric Interconnect | | |
| CSCtk35213 | Fabric interconnect activation during a downgrade from 1.4(1) to 1.3(1) will fail if the setup has an active Nexus 2248 Fabric Extender. | Decommission all fabric extenders and rack-servers and completely decommission the FSM before downgrading the fabric interconnect image. |
| CSCtk09043 | The server UUID displayed by ipmitool does not match that shown by the Cisco UCS Manager CLI. UCS UUID encoding follows pre SMBIOS 2.6 specified encoding, which is big-endian encoding. Ipmitool does not work well with that encoding. The SMBIOS 2.6 specification mandates mixed encoding (first 3 fields little-endian, last 3 big-endian), which is followed by ipmitool.  For example, the server detail from Cisco UCS Manager CLI shows:   Dynamic UUID: 0699a6f3-1b81-45f8-a9f2-c1bbe089324e     # ipmitool -H 10.193.142.104 -U gurudev -P password mc guid  System GUID: f3a69906-811b-f845-a9f2-c1bbe089324e     Compared to Cisco UCS Manager CLI or GUI output, the first 3 fields f3a69906-811b-f845 show up differently in the output of ipmitool. | The following usage of ipmitool can be a workaround:  #ipmitool -H 10.193.142.104 -U gurudev -P password raw 0x06 0x37   06 99 a6 f3 1b 81 45 f8 a9 f2 c1 bb e0 89 32 4e     The output matches the value printed by the Cisco UCS Manager CLI. |
| CSCtj10809 | The show port-security NX-OS CLI command returns a negative value for the Max Addresses. This will occur when a system is configured with more than 8192 Port VLAN instances and. port security is enabled on all interfaces such that more than 8192 MACs are secured. | Do not configure port-security such that secured Port VLAN instances is more than 8192. |
| CSCti85875 | When an N2XX-ACPCI01 adapter port on a C-series server is connected to an uplink port on a UCS 6100 fabric interconnect, a fault message should appear because this connection is not supported, but there is no such fault message for this situation in this release. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CIMC | | |
| CSCtj93577 | The Blade CIMstic management IP address assignment is not included in backups. | Manually record the blade CIMC static management IP address assignments, and re-enter them if necessary. |
| RAID/Local Disk | | |
| CSCtf73879 | Cisco UCS B200 M3 and Cisco UCS B22 M3 servers currently do not support disk status, failures, fault codes, and alarms from MegaRAID controller. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtj03021 | For the B200 and B250 blade servers, the Local Disks 'Operability' field is reported as “N/A”. The 'Operability' field of the Local Disks in B200 and B250 is expected to have a correct value and should not be reporting 'N/A'. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtf84982 | For the MegaRAID Controller on the B440 blade server, Cisco UCS Manager fails to report BBU Status, Properties and Errors. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtj48519 | If one or more conditions are met, Cisco UCS Manager fails to capture certain Local Disk errors. Conditions include: Mixing the SAS and SATA Local Disks in the same server; Disk spin-up or disks present but not reaching 'Ready' state; Missing Disks. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtf17708 | Cisco UCS Manager does not include the implementation for the Write Through, Write Back, and Write back with BBU MegaRAID Battery (BBU) Write Policies for the B440 server. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCti39470 | Cisco UCS Manager currently does not support RAID 50 and RAID 60. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtj89447 | Cisco UCS Manager fails to create a single disk striped RAID config in the Storage Controller 1064E environment. | This issue has no known workaround. |

| CSCua46077 | On ethernet border port failure, host ports are repinned to new border port. This could cause a few FCoE frames to be dropped. This issue is seen on failover from one ethernet border port to another, and only when there is a high rate of FCoE traffic. | This is a transient issue and recovers immediately.  Resolved: This issue is resolved in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.0(5a). |

### Release 1.2(1)

### The following caveats were opened in Release 1.2(1):

Table 57 Open Caveats in Release 1.2(1)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Hat Linux | | |
| CSCte73015 | Loading multiple driver disks during a RHEL 5.x installation fails. | See the article at  <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-17753> |
| BIOS | | |
| CSCtb20301 | Hubs that only use USB 1.0 may not properly present an attached USB device to the UCS server. | Avoid using USB hubs that are exclusively USB 1.0 capable. Virtually all USB hubs sold today are USB 1.0/2.0 capable. |
| CIMC | | |
| CSCti94391 | When using mirroring mode, if a UCE error happens, there is a Redundancy SEL event and also a UCE SEL event. No other details are available for the Data Parity error. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| Adapters | | |
| CSCtj89468 | The link from the rack-mount server adapter to the fabric interconnect port remains down if the SFP type is FET (Fabric extender transceiver). Currently the FET type is supported only between a fabric extender and a fabric interconnect. If the SFP used for the link between the IOM and the rack-mount server adapter is an FET, the link will remain down. | Replace the SFP with one of the supported SFPs for rack-mount server adapters. |
| Cisco UCS Manager | | |
| CSCte58483 | The PCIe Address for the Cisco UCS M81KR Virtual Interface Card is not seen in the GUI (or CLI). It causes no functional impact. | The only workaround is to boot some host OS onto the blade and then determine the PCI address and map it to the MAC address (and subsequently to the VNIC). In a 2.6 kernel based Linux for instance, the /sys/class/net/<device> directory has relevant information. |
| CSCte44668 | Modification of trusted CoS policy in Service Profile does not get immediately applied to the server. If you modify the trusted CoS policy of an adapter profile in a service profile that is currently attached to a physical server, a server reboot is needed. Since it is unsafe to automatically reboot an associated server, UCSM currently does not. | Manually reboot the server or disassociate and reassociate the server to get the CoS policy to be applied. |
| CSCtd14055 | For each Cisco UCS 82598KR-CI 10 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, 2 interfaces show up in the OS and ethtool reports Link Detected = yes for both of them. This is only seen on Cisco UCS B250 servers. | Use the MAC that has the value provisioned in the service profile. |
| Cisco UCS Manager GUI | | |
| CSCte58155 | When upgrading from releases prior to 1.1.1, OS-specific default adapter policies will not have the current recommended default values. | After an upgrade from a release prior to 1.1.1, we recommend manually changing the adapter policy parameters to the following values:  Eth VMWare->RSS: Disabled  Eth VMWarePassThru->RSS: Enabled  Eth default->RSS: Enabled     FC (all)->FCP Error Recovery: Disabled  FC (all)->Flogi Retries: 8  FC (all)->Flogi Timeout: 4000  FC (all)->Plogi Timeout: 20000  FC (all)->IO Throttle Count: 16  FC (all)->Max LUNs Per Target: 256 |
| CSCta21326 | Logon access is denied for user accounts where the password field was left blank during user account creation. | When creating a user account, ensure that a secure password for the account is specified. |

### Release 1.1(1)

### This section lists the open caveats in release 1.1(1j).

Table 58 Open Caveats in Release 1.1(1j)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BIOS | | |
| CSCtd90695 | With the B-250 blade server, the displayed ESX and Linux OS HDD Boot Device Order is the reverse of the BIOS HDD Boot Order. | Review both the disks (and drive labels as applicable) during installations of ESX and Linux versions and choose the correct disk for installation. |
| CSCta45805 | FSM gets stuck in an Error Configuring the Local Disk Controller state due to various underlying conditions. Those can include but are not limited to the following:   * The Local Disks not getting discovered correctly or are “available/presence-Equipped” but not in a Ready state. * Failures that can't be correctly communicated to Cisco UCS Manager can get reported as this type of error. | Remove and insert all of the local disks from the failing server, then re-acknowledge the server. |
| CSCsy76853 | The Disk Fault/Error Codes, Disk Status, Alarms and the failures forwarded by the SAS Controller are not received by Cisco UCS Manager. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCtb12390 | After resetting the CMOS the system date needs to be reset to current. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| Red Hat Linux | | |
| CSCte44548 | When a vNIC is not in failover mode and a link down event occurs, the network traffic on the blades is disrupted with a system running RHEL 5.3. | This is a known issue with the ixgbe driver in RHEL 5.3 and because RHEL 5.4 is the latest release, Red Hat recommends upgrading the systems to the RHEL 5.4. If you cannot upgrade to RHEL 5.4, below are a few suggestions that has been found to work.  **1.** Restart the network.    service network restart  or    ifdown ethx    ifup ethx    **2.** Run your system with nomsi.   * Edit /etc/grub.conf * Add pci=nomsi to the kernel line * Restart the system with this kernel   Note that network performance may be affected since the system is running in legacy mode. |
| Cisco UCS Manager | | |
| CSCsy80888 | After the removal or insertion of one or more local disks, their full discovery fails. | Re-acknowledge the server to complete the full discovery. |
| CSCte12163 | For a given port profile with existing VIFs, if the “Max-Ports” setting is reduced from the currently configured value to a value less than the “Used-Ports” value reported for that port profile by VMware vCenter, this is a mis-configuration. The new value for “Max-Ports” for that port profile will only be updated in Cisco UCS Manager and its update in VMware Center will fail, causing a inconsistency between Cisco UCS Manager and VMware Center Server. | If the need arises to reduce the value of “Max-Ports” of a given port profile, the new value should be at least the value of “Used-Ports” reported by the VMware Center for all the DVSes for that port profile (not lower than maximum of all the “Used-Ports” values). This constraint has to be ensured manually. |
| Cisco UCS Manager GUI | | |
| CSCtb35660 | When a cluster configuration is set up such that I/O module 1 goes to fabric interconnect B and I/O module 2 goes to fabric interconnect A, then the Ethernet devices are given ports 1 and 0. However if the setup is straight, with I/O Module 1 connected to fabric interconnect A and I/O Module 2 to fabric interconnect B, then the devices are assigned ports 0 and 1. | Connect IOM1 to fabric-interconnect A, and IOM2 to fabric-interconnect B. |
| UCS Manager CLI | | |
| CSCtc86297 | The UUID of the VM changes in VMware vCenter. After a VM restarts, the virtual machine node on the VM tab shows multiple instances of the same VM with one online and one offline. | After the VM retention period configured in the VM lifecycle policy has passed, Cisco UCS Manager deletes the offline instance automatically. |

### Release 1.0(2)

### This section lists the open caveats in release 1.0(2).

Table 59 Open Caveats in Release 1.0(2)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BIOS | | |
| CSCtc21336 | With various Local Disk Configurations, the LSI SAS Configuration Utility fails to launch while in BIOS. | The LSI SAS Controller Utility should not be used and all of the Local Disk Policy and Service Profile operations must be executed using Cisco UCS Manager. |
| CSCsy54097 | When the memory mirroring configuration is destroyed by removing a DIMM, the BIOS will switch to the Performance mode, and will not log a message that mirroring was disabled. | Check the status of the memory mirroring in  **BIOS Setup->Advanced -> Memory Configuration -> Memory RAS and Performance Configuration**. |
| CSCsz41907 | When plugging or removing USB devices at **BIOS Setup -> Advanced -> USB**, the Setup Utility may hang. | Reboot the server. |
| HTTP | | |
| CSCtc13234 | HTTPD process crashed, with the following event log:  Process crashed. Core file 1253640662\_SAM\_ucs-6120-1-A\_httpd\_log.3114.tar.gz (SAM/Switch Core Dump) detected on fabric interconnect A | This issue has no known workaround. |
| Cisco UCS Manager GUI | | |
| CSCta94641 | When waking up from sleep, the Cisco UCS Manager GUI will detect an event sequencing error and display the error: “Event Sequencing is skewed” because the JRE does not have a sleep detection mechanism. | Always shut down the UCSM GUI before putting your computer to sleep. |
| CSCtb45761 | Downloads may be slow if TFTP is used. | If TFTP performance is slow, use SCP or another protocol. |

### Release 1.0(1)

### This section lists the open caveats in release 1.0(1).

Table 60 Open Caveats in Release 1.0(1)

| Defect ID | Symptom | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AAA | | |
| CSCsz44814 | Local user passwords cannot contain “$” character. | Do not include the “$” character in local user passwords. |
| Adapters | | |
| CSCsz68887 | When a service profile containing two vNICs and having failover enabled is applied to QLogic or Emulex CNAs, the failback timeout specified in the adapter policy for the second vNIC has no effect. The failback timeout specified in the adapter policy and applied to the first vNIC is applied to the whole adapter and is effective for both vNICs. | Specify the desired failback timeout in the adapter policy and apply to the first vNIC. |
| BIOS | | |
| CSCsz99666 | Installing EFI Native SLES 11 is currently not supported. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCsz41107 | One vNIC defined in the Cisco UCS Manager service profile boot order results in two BIOS vNICs. | Avoid defining two different pxelinux.cfg/<MAC> files that have different boot/install instructions. When booted, both vNICs should execute the same PXE configuration. |
| Fabric Interconnect | | |
| CSCsx13134 | When a fabric interconnect boots, the “The startup-config won't be used until the next reboot” message appears on the console. Fabric interconnect configuration is controlled by the UCS Manager, so this message has no meaning on the fabric interconnect configuration and has no functional impact. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCsy15489 | Console logon usernames on the fabric interconnect are not case sensitive. For example, there is no differentiation between admin and ADMIN. | Use case insensitive usernames. |
| CSCta09325 | When the system is under high stress, with repeated port flapping (ports rapidly going up and down) and default (native) VLAN change, the FWM process may core and cause the fabric interconnect to reload. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCta25287 | The  **show cdp neighbor** CLI command does not display information for CDP neighbors seen from the management interface, nor does it display the fabric interconnect CDP information corresponding to the management interface. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| Faults and Alerts | | |
| CSCta76573 | In rare cases the Cisco UCS Manager reports the link absence fault between the fabric interconnect server port and the fabric extender during the internal inventory collection. The following is an example of such a fault:  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  Severity: Cleared  Code: F0367  Last Transition Time: 2009-07-15T11:47:49  ID: 646445  Status: None  Description: No link between fabric extender port 2/1/1 and switch A:1/9  Affected Object: sys/chassis-2/slot-1/fabric/port-1  Name: Ether Switch Intfio Satellite Connection Absent Cause: Satellite Connection Absent  Type: Connectivity  Acknowledged: No  Occurences: 1  Creation Time: 2009-07-15T11:46:49  Original Severity: Major  Previous Severity: Major  Highest Severity: Major  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* | Ignore the fault message; it will automatically get cleared after one minute. This will not impact the data path. |
| Inventory | | |
| CSCta12005 | Hardware revision numbers for fabric interconnect components are not populated in the Cisco UCS Manager. | Perform the following steps to determine the revision number for a fabric interconnect component:  1. Enter the **connect nxos** command to connect to the native NX-OS CLI.  2. Enter the appropriate  **show sprom**  *component* command and look for  **H/W Version:** field in the command output. |
| Server | | |
| CSCsy20036 | The disk scrub policy needs enhancements to meet DOD compliance. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| SNMP | | |
| CSCta22029 | SNMP shows the fabric interconnect name rather than system name. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCta24034 | An SNMP username cannot be the same as a local username. | Select an SNMP username that does not match any local username. |
| SMASH | | |
| CSCsv87256 | Any SMASH command entered with wrong option should give “INVALID OPTION” error message. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| Cisco UCS Manager CLI | | |
| CSCsz47512 | Statistics counters cannot be cleared using the Cisco UCS Manager CLI. | Clear the counters using the Cisco UCS Manager GUI. |
| Cisco UCS Manager GUI | | |
| CSCta38463 | When several KVM Consoles are launched, the SUN JRE sometimes reports an error and the KVM Console fails to launch. | Launch the KVM Console again. |
| CSCta54895 | In the Cisco UCS Manager GUI, if the  **Reboot on boot Order Change** checkbox is checked for a boot policy, and if CD-ROM or Floppy is the last device in the boot order, then deleting or adding the device does not directly affect the boot order and the server does not reboot. | This issue has no known workaround. |
| CSCta66375 | Fibre Channel port and server port events do not appear on the Fibre Channel port and server port  **Events** tabs. | Look on the Admin  **Events** tab for Fibre Channel port and server port events. |
