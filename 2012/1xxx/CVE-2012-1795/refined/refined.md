Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1795 (Although the provided content from CERT doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2012-1795, it refers to vulnerability note VU#364363, which is related to a command injection vulnerability in WebGlimpse, a web site search application. CVE-2012-1795 is often associated with this vulnerability.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `webglimpse.cgi` script contains a command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands. Specifically, the `query` URL parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web server user.
- Attackers are reported to be leveraging this vulnerability to install PHP backdoors on affected web servers, potentially gaining persistent access and control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL Query Parameter:** A specially crafted `query` parameter in the URL is used to inject system commands. For example `query=%27%26command+and+arguments+go+here%26%27`.
- The attacker interacts with the web server by making a request containing the malicious query parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `webglimpse.cgi` script on the target web server.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific malicious string to be inserted into the `query` parameter.
- No authentication required.
