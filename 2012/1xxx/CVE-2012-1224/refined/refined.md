- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The login page of ContentLion Alpha 1.3 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability lies in the way the application handles user input in the login page, specifically within the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The provided code snippet highlights the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user input in the `login.html` page, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through a crafted URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the login page. When a user visits this crafted link, the injected code will be executed within the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing user credentials, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL to the login page. The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject code using a URL containing `'"` to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious link to a victim. No special privileges are needed, as this is a client-side attack that exploits a vulnerability in the application's handling of user input.
