      "root_cause": "The application's session tokens are not required to perform privileged functions, such as adding users. Authentication and authorization is controlled by the cookie-based session management system. Although this is implemented in a standardized way, the session tokens are not required to perform privileged functions.",

        "SQL Injection"

      "weaknesses": [
        "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that will be executed when other users access specific pages, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vector": "HTTP GET request with malicious JavaScript in the 'newUser' parameter which gets stored in the database.",

       "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
