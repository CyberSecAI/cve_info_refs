... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807485#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-27 22:08:22 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that Apache Struts2 suffers from a local code execution flaw when processing malformed XSLT files.  This could allow a malicious remote user able to upload an arbitrary file and then view it (such as a graphics file), and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the struts2 process user.  NOTE: During normal usage, applications that receive untrusted input/files from remote users are expected to properly sanity-check the file and, if nothing else, not immediately make the file uploaded by an untrusted user, available to an untrusted user, without first checking the file.  [1] <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Mar/110>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=807485#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-28 15:39:47 UTC  ``` This was assigned [CVE-2012-1592](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1592) as per:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/28/12>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=807485#c3)  Chess Hazlett    2019-09-17 20:37:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  A previous statement by Red Hat related to this CVE, prior to August 2019, said that Apache Struts 2 is not included in any Red Hat products. This earlier statement was incorrect. While Struts 2 is not actively compiled, shipped, used, or enabled in any Red Hat provided final products, and does not cause any vulnerability in the product, struts2-core jars have been included in some products' source code packages. The inclusion was part of an import of the Google Guice repository, which includes struts2-core. Customers that build artefacts from our source code could be at risk. Red Hat will remove these artefacts from source code in future releases.  The products that included the Struts 2 artefacts in their source jars: Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 Single Sign On 7.3.0+  If you have used the source package from one of these products to build artefacts on your system, you should do the following to remove potentially affected jars: 1. Run 'find . -name struts2*.jar' under the source location 2. Remove any files found This will not affect the product, as the jar is included with the source of google-guice, but no functionality requiring struts2 is implemented.   ``` |  |
