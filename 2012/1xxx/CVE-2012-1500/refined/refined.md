Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in JIRA and GreenHopper.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS (CWE-79):**  The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored and executed when other users view the affected content.
- **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The exploit leverages the absence of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, allowing an attacker to submit malicious requests on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session.
- **Session Hijacking:**  The injected script can be used to steal user credentials (username, password, cookies).
- **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to JIRA accounts, including privileged accounts.
- **System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain control over the JIRA issue tracker and connected systems.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially steal or modify sensitive data within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network via a malicious link.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a logged-in JIRA user into visiting an attacker-controlled link.
- **CSRF:** The attack leverages a hidden form performing a POST request to inject the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Link:** The attacker needs to host a web page with a malicious form.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in JIRA user to visit their link.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the targeted JIRA system. However, the user whose session is being hijacked needs to be logged in.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in JIRA version 4.4.3#663-r165197 and GreenHopper versions prior to 5.9.8.
- The vulnerability was resolved in GreenHopper version 5.9.8.
- The exploit requires minimal interaction by the victim, where a simple click on a link is enough to execute the payload.
- The provided proof of concept code demonstrates the injection of JavaScript into the `summary` field within a JIRA issue.
- The injected script can steal cookies and other authentication details, which can be sent to a server controlled by the attacker, leading to account compromise.

This information provides a good overview of the technical details of the vulnerability.
