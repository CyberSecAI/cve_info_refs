## Introduction

[JIRA](https://web.archive.org/web/20121014055829/http%3A//www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview) (/ˈdʒɪərə/ JEER-ə) is a proprietary issue tracking
product, developed by Atlassian, commonly used for bug tracking, issue
tracking, and project management. It has been developed since 2002. JIRA is a
commercial software product that can be licensed for running on-premises or
available as a hosted solution.

[GreenHopper](https://web.archive.org/web/20121014055829/http%3A//www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/overview) -
GreenHopper unlocks the power of Agile, whether you're a seasoned Agile expert
or just getting started. Creating user stories, estimating those stories for a sprint
backlog, identifying team velocity, visualizing team activity and reporting
progress has never been so easy.
## Exploit

Our researchers discovered a Stored XSS
vulnerability allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into an
existing and fully patched JIRA + GreenHopper installations (JIRA=V4.4.3,
GreenHopper prior to V5.9.8).

The requirements for a successful attack are minimal:

A user logged into the targeted
JIRA issue tracking system needs to be convinced to visit an attacker
controlled link.

Once that link has been visited by the unsuspecting
victim, an invisible form will perform a POST request and the victim will be
redirected to a URL where *username*, *password* and login
credentials such as cookies can be read and processed by the attacker.

An attacker can obtain access to privileged accounts and
get control over the JIRA issue tracker and connected systems.

External References: CVE-2112-1500 CVE-2112-1500 XSS.Cx Blog GHS-5642

XSS.Cx Research Award to Reporter: 1250 Euros

Introduction

JIRA (/'d???r?/ JEER-?) is a proprietary issue tracking product,
developedby Atlassian, commonly used for bug tracking, issue tracking,
and project management. It has been developed since 2002. JIRA is a
commercial software product that can be licensed for running
on-premises or available as a hosted solution.

GreenHopper - GreenHopper unlocks the power of Agile, whether you're a
seasoned Agile expert or just getting started. Creating user stories,
estimating those stories for a sprint backlog, identifying team
velocity, visualizing team activity and reporting progress has never
been so easy.

Exploit

The Anonymous Researchers discovered a Stored XSS vulnerability
allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into an existing
and fully patched JIRA + GreenHopper installations (JIRA=V4.4.3,
GreenHopper prior to V5.9.8). The requirements for a successful attack
are minimal. A user logged into the targeted JIRA issue tracking
system needs to be convinced to visit an attacker controlled link.
Once that link has been visited by the unsuspecting victim, an
invisible form will perform a POST request and the victim will be
redirected to a URL where username, password and login credentials
such as cookies can be read and processed by the attacker. An attacker
can obtain access to privileged accounts and get control over the JIRA
issue tracker and connected systems.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
