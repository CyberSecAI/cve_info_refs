# CVE-2013-4238

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2013-4237.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2013-4239.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2013-4238 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4238)

#### Description

The ssl.match\_hostname function in the SSL module in Python 2.6 through 3.4 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-01 15:03:19 UTC  ``` Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink reported a flaw in the hash function used in the implementation of the Python dictionaries (associative arrays).  A specially-crafted set of keys could trigger hash function collisions, which degrade dictionary performance by changing hash table operations complexity from an expected/average O(1) to the worst case O(n).  Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using meet in the middle attack.  As various web application frameworks for Python automatically pre-fill certain dictionaries with data from the HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters) for Python web application, a remote attacker could use this flaw to make Python interpreter use excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with large amount of parameters which hash to the same value.  This problem is similar to the issue that was previously reported for and fixed in e.g. perl:   <http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-01 15:07:17 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-29 15:43:51 UTC  ``` This issue was presented on 28C3: <http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4680.en.html>  Details were posted to full-disclosure: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Dec/477>  oCERT advisory: <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html>  n.runs advisory (copy of the full-disclosure post): <http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf>  28C3 slides and recording: <http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007_28C3_Effective_DoS_on_web_application_platforms.pdf> <http://www.youtube.com/28c3#p/u/22/R2Cq3CLI6H8>  Another good write-up of the issue: <http://cryptanalysis.eu/blog/2011/12/28/effective-dos-attacks-against-web-application-plattforms-hashdos/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-30 13:38:04 UTC  ``` New and old threads on python-dev related to this issue:  <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2011-December/115116.html> <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-May/035874.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-30 13:42:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c10)) > <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2011-December/115116.html> > <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-May/035874.html>  Same discussions in gmane archive, which is better at showing discussions that span over more than one month:  <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/128267> <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/50762>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c13)  Dave Malcolm    2012-01-03 23:56:07 UTC  ``` (this is being tracked upstream as <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703> )   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c21)  Dave Malcolm    2012-01-13 05:15:46 UTC  ``` python-dev status update: <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/128617>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c31)  Dave Malcolm    2012-01-20 04:27:26 UTC  ``` The collision-counting approach is now favored upstream (over hash randomization):   <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-January/115690.html> [+1 from Guido here: <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-January/115692.html> ]   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c32)  Dave Malcolm    2012-01-20 04:32:46 UTC  ``` For reference, latest version of lemburg's patch using collision-counting approach is currently this one:   <http://bugs.python.org/file24151/hash-attack.patch> (from 2012-01-06)   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c35)  Dave Malcolm    2012-01-24 02:55:09 UTC  ``` Upstream seems to be dithering between collision-counting and hash randomization, or some combination, and the discussion seems to have grown out-of-control.  For my part, I've posted some patches upstream:  (A) "hash-collision-counting-dmalcolm-2012-01-20-001.patch"     <http://bugs.python.org/file24286>     (see <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151707> ) in which I further developed lemburg's first collision-counting patch  I then had a brainstorm and tried another approach: (B) "amortized-probe-counting-dmalcolm-2012-01-20-002.patch"     <http://bugs.python.org/file24288>     (see <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151714> )  (C) "amortized-probe-counting-dmalcolm-2012-01-21-003.patch"     <http://bugs.python.org/file24289>     (see <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151735> ) tracking per-dict statistics, in particular: the amortized average cost per modification of each dict, and raising an exception when the average exceeds a given threshold for a given dict.  This seems to work for all of python's test suite, and very quickly detects and complains about hostile input.  It's rather experimental though, and the ratio/scale-factor is a number I chose arbitrarily, and I haven't gone through the math or gathered real numbers on real code.  There are a few issues that would need fixing (see Antoine Pitrou's comments on it).  However, there's an argument that any approach that can lead to dict (or set) raising an exception is flawed: see <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151796>  It strikes me that this "protection" may allow yet another new class of attack, it which the attacker slowly poisons inputs, so that when a dict is constructed at some later point, an exception is raised you weren't expecting.  If the protection wasn't there you'd get the extreme slowdown, rather an exception.  But: my patch is too good :)  it's too efficient at detecting when it's under attack: the exception is raised too quickly, and so arguably we've made the job easier for the attacker.  But maybe I'm overthinking this?  Perhaps I just need to tune things?  (D) <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151847> in which I backported haypo's hash randomization patch from the main branch to the 2.7 branch.  This patch disables the hash randomization by default, and only does it for string-like types, not numeric types (for reasons noted in that comment).  When enabled with "PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION=1 python", this patch successfully blocks the reproducer.  (there's also another hash randomization patch beyond haypo's, which does a few things a little differently; see python issue 13704).  Note that hash randomization is known to break Django's test suite, which is why I'm wary about enabling it by default.   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c37)  Dave Malcolm    2012-01-25 11:54:52 UTC  ``` I came up with a hybrid approach, which I believe combines the best aspects of the collision-counting and hash-randomization approaches.  I've posted it for upstream review here:     <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151939>  In this approach, by default, hash() and dict don't use hash randomization - preserving existing behavior.  It detects when a given dict is under attack, and transitions just that dict to use randomized hashes.  It preserves ABI - however, in order to do this, the randomization only happens for str/unicode/bytes keys.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, given the various attack scenarios on a web server (e.g. it should cover HTTP headers, POST fields, JSON, XML-RPC).  It will probably need performance tuning and extensive testing.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c38)  Dave Malcolm    2012-01-28 02:19:36 UTC  ``` Upstream has reached a consensus about a security release (adding hash-randomization in disabled form with an envvar to enable it): <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-January/115892.html>  I've been volunteered by the release managers of those upstream branches to create the patches (based on the work I've already done; see (D) above: <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151847> ).   ```  [Comment 55](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c55)  Kurt Seifried    2012-03-10 05:52:17 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/10/3>   ```  [Comment 56](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c56)  Huzaifa S.

However, randomization is disabled by default to avoid breaking code that incorrectly relies on specific ordering of dictionary keys.  Updated python versions provide following ways to enable randomization:  - PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable, which is expected to be set to a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295], or "random", with the following meaning:   - "random" - new random seed is generated during interpreter start, seed     is not predictable across python interpreter invocations   - 0 - use the same seed as was used by older python versions, effectively     disabling randomization   - other values - use specific fixed seed value, which is different from     seed that was used in older python versions; this may be useful in test     suites or environments when multiple python instances are expected to     produce the same hash values - -R command line option, its use is equivalent to setting PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to "random"  Refer to python command manual page for further details: <http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.8/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-R> <http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.8/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED>   ```  [Comment 73](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c73)  Fedora Update System    2012-05-06 01:25:59 UTC  ``` python-2.7.3-1.fc16, python-docs-2.7.3-1.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

This causes no issues for most use cases, but may cause problems where updated Python standard library is used with not updated Python executable.  Such problem was reported for Python virtualenv use cases, see:  <http://bugs.python.org/issue14444#msg158172>  The above link also provides instructions on how to fix the problem.  These instructions are also available on the virtualenv project news page:  <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/news.html>    Warning: Python bugfix releases 2.6.8, 2.7.3, 3.1.5 and 3.2.3 include a   change that will cause “import random” to fail with “cannot import name   urandom” on any virtualenv created on a Unix host with an earlier release   of Python 2.6/2.7/3.1/3.2, if the underlying system Python is upgraded.   This is due to the fact that a virtualenv uses the system Python’s standard   library but contains its own copy of the Python interpreter, so an upgrade   to the system Python results in a mismatch between the version of the Python   interpreter and the version of the standard library. It can be fixed by   removing $ENV/bin/python and re-running virtualenv on the same target   directory with the upgraded Python.   ```  [Comment 77](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c77)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-18 12:32:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0744 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0744.html>   ```  [Comment 78](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c78)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-18 12:42:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0745 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0745.html>   ```  [Comment 79](show_bug.cgi?id=750555#c79)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-19 14:53:04 UTC  ``` python3-3.2.3-2.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

# USN-1592-1: Python 2.7 vulnerabilities

2 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.7.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [python2.7](/security/cves?package=python2.7) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.7)

## Details

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

## Packages

* [python3.1](/security/cves?package=python3.1) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 3.1)

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. These issues only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not

properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could

exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption.

([CVE-2012-2135](/security/CVE-2012-2135))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Python 2.6.8

**Release Date:** April 10, 2012

Python 2.6 is now in security-fix-only mode; no new features are being added,
and no new bug fix releases are planned. We intend to provide source-only
security fixes for the Python 2.6 series until October 2013 (five years after
the 2.6 final release). For ongoing maintenance releases, please see the
Python [2.7](../2.7/) series. The [NEWS file](NEWS.txt) lists every
change in each alpha, beta, and release candidate of Python 2.6.

> * [What's New in Python 2.6](http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.6.html).
> * Report bugs at <http://bugs.python.org>.
> * Read the [Python license](license).
> * [PEP 361](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0361/) set out the development schedule for 2.6.

Help fund Python and its community by [donating to the Python Software Foundation](/psf/donations/).

# Download

This is a final release; we currently support these formats:

> * [Gzipped source tar ball (2.6.8)](/ftp/python/2.6.8/Python-2.6.8.tgz)
>   [(sig)](/ftp/python/2.6.8/Python-2.6.8.tgz.asc)
> * [Bzipped source tar ball (2.6.8)](/ftp/python/2.6.8/Python-2.6.8.tar.bz2)
>   [(sig)](/ftp/python/2.6.8/Python-2.6.8.tar.bz2.asc)

MD5 checksums and sizes of the released files:

```

f6c1781f5d73ab7dfa5181f43ea065f6  13282574  Python-2.6.8.tgz
c6e0420a21d8b23dee8b0195c9b9a125  11127915  Python-2.6.8.tar.bz2

```

The signatures for the source tarballs above were generated with
[GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org) using release manager
Barry Warsaw's
[public key](/download#pubkeys)
which has a key id of A74B06BF.

# Notes

Developers on Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) or later may experience
problems when building Python 2.6 from source, due to the adoption of
[multiarch](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec) support. See [issue 9762](http://bugs.python.org/issue9762) for additional details and
workarounds. The version of Python 2.6 in Ubuntu itself has been
appropriately patched, so the Ubuntu source package should build just
fine.

# Documentation

The documentation has also been updated. You can [browse the HTML on-line](http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.8) or [download the HTML](http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.8/download.html).

# USN-1596-1: Python 2.6 vulnerabilities

4 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.6.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python2.6](/security/cves?package=python2.6) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

```
Hello everyone,
In effort to get a fix out before Perl 6 goes mainstream, Barry and I
have decided to pronounce on what we want for our stable releases.
What we have decided is that
1. Simple hash randomization is the way to go. We think this has the
best chance of actually fixing the problem while being fairly
straightforward such that we're comfortable putting it in a stable
release.
2. It will be off by default in stable releases and enabled by an
envar at runtime. This will prevent code breakage from dictionary
order changing as well as people depending on the hash stability.

Regards,
Benjamin

| ``` This is already publicly known and in deep discussion on python-dev.  The proper fix is still TBD.  Essentially, hash collisions can be exploited to DoS a web framework that automatically parses input forms into dictionaries.  Start here:  <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2011-December/115116.html> ``` | | | |

| ``` I had a short chat with Guido yesterday. I'll try to sum up the conversation. Guido, please correct me if I got something wrong or missed a point.  Guido wants the fix as simple and less intrusive as possible as he wants to provide/apply a patch for Python 2.4 to 3.3. This means any new stuff is off the table unless it's really, really necessary. Say goodbye to my experimental MurmurHash3 patch.  We haven't agreed whether the randomization should be enabled by default or disabled by default. IMHO it should be disabled for all releases except for the upcoming 3.3 release. The env var PYTHONRANDOMHASH=1 would enable the randomization. It's simple to set the env var in e.g. Apache for mod_python and mod_wsgi. ``` | | | |

| ``` > Unless there's evidence of performance regressions > or backward incompatibilities, I agree.  If hash() is modified, str(dict) and str(set) will change for example. It may break doctests. Can we consider that the application should not rely (indirectly) on hash and so fix (for example) their doctests? Or is it a backward incompatibility?  hash() was already modified in major Python versions.  For this specific issue, I consider that security is more important than str(dict). ``` | | | |

| ``` Christian Heimes proposes the following change in its randomhash branch (see issue [#13704](issue13704 "[closed] Random number generator in Python core")):  -    x = (Py_uhash_t) *p << 7; +    x = Py_RndHashSeed + ((Py_uhash_t) *p << 7);      for (i = 0; i < len; i++)          x = (1000003U * x) ^ (Py_uhash_t) *p++;      x ^= (Py_uhash_t) len;  This change doesn't add any security if the attacker can inject any string and retreive the hash value. You can retreive directly Py_RndHashSeed using:  Py_RndHashSeed = intmask((hash("a") ^ len("a") ^ ord("a")) * DIVIDE) - (ord("a") << 7)  where intmask() truncates to a long (x mod 2^(long bits)) and DIVIDE = 1/1000003 mod 2^(long bits). For example, DIVIDE=2021759595 for 32 bits long. ``` | | | |

| ``` Victor, please ignore my code related to hash randomization for now. I've deliberately not linked my branch to this bug report. I'm well aware that it's not secure and that it's pretty easy to reverse engineer the seed from a hash of a short string. The code is a proof of concept to detect failing tests and other issues.  I'm in private contact with Paul and we are working together. He has done extended research and I'll gladly follow his expertise. I've already discussed the issue with small strings, but I can't recall if it was a private mail to Paul or a public one to the dev list.  Paul: I still think that you should special case short strings (five or few chars sound good). An attacker can't do much harm with one to five char strings but such short strings may make it too easy to calculate the seed.  16kb of seed is still a lot. Most CPUs have about 16 to 32, maybe 64kb L1 cache for data. 1024 to 4096 bytes should increase cache locality and reduce speed impacts.  PS: I'm going to reply to your last mail tomorrow. ``` | | | |

| ``` In [#13707](issue13707 "[closed] Clarify hash() constancy period") I suggest a change to the current hash() entry which is needed independently of this issue, because the default hash (for object()), being tied to id() is already limited to an object's lifetime. But this change will become more imperative if hash() is made run-dependent for numbers and strings.  There does not seems to presently *be* a security hole for 64 bit builds, so if there is any noticeable slowdown on 64 bit builds and it is sensibly easy to tie the default to the bitness, I would think it should be off for such builds. ``` | | | |

| ``` A couple of things here:  First, my proposed change is not cryptographically secure. There simply aren't any cryptographic hashing algorithms available that are in the performance class we need. My proposal does make the collision attack quite difficult to carry out, even if the raw output values from the hash are available to the attacker (they should not usually be).  I favor using the same algorithm between 32 and 64 bit builds for consistency of behavior. Developers would be startled to find that ordering stays consistent on a 64 bit build but varies on 32 bit builds. Additionally, the impracticality of attacking of 64 bit builds rests on the fact that these particular researchers didn't devise a way to do it. I'd hate to make this change and then have a clever mathematician publish some elegant point requiring us to go fix the problem all over again.   I could be convinced either way on small strings. I like that they can't be used to attack the secret. At the same time, I worry that combining 2 different hashing routines into the same output space may introduce unexpected collisions and other difficult to debug edge-case conditions. It also means that the order of the hashes of long strings will vary while the order of short strings will not - another inconsistency which will encourage bugs.  Thank you Victor for the improvements to the python demonstration code. As Antoine said, it's only demo code, but better demo code is always good.  Antoine: That section of the manpage is referring to the overall security of a key generated using urandom. 256 bits is overkill for this application. We could take 256 bits and use them to generate a key using a cryptographically appropriate algorithm, but it's simpler to read more bits and use them directly as the key.  Additionally, that verbiage has been in the man page for urandom for quite some time (probably since the earliest version in the mid 90's). The PRNG has been improved since then.  Minimum length of r is a hard question. The shorter it is, the higher the correlation of the output. In my tests, 16kb was the amount necessary to generally do reasonably well on my test suite for randomness even with problematic input. Obviously our existing output isn't random, so it doesn't pass those tests at all. Using a fairly small value (4k) should not make the results much worse from a security perspective, but might be problematic from a collision/distribution standpoint. It's clear that we don't need cryptographically good randomness here, but passing the test suite is not a bad thing when considering the distribution.  When we settle on a C implementation, I'd like to run it through the smhasher set of tests to make sure we aren't making distribution worse, especially for very small values of r. ``` | | | |

Keep in mind the average L1 data cache size is between 16KB and 64KB. 4KB is already a significant chunk of that.  Given a hash function's typical loop is to feed back the current result into the next computation, I don't see why a small value (e.g. 256 bytes) would be detrimental. ``` | | | |

| ``` Some comments:  1. The security implications in all this is being somewhat overemphasized.  There are many ways you can do a DoS attack on web servers. It's the responsibility of the used web frameworks and servers to deal with the possible cases.  It's a good idea to provide some way to protect against hash collision attacks, but that will only solve one possible way of causing a resource attack on a server.  There are other ways you can generate lots of CPU overhead with little data input (e.g. think of targeting the search feature on many Zope/Plone sites).  In order to protect against such attacks in general, we'd have to provide a way to control CPU time and e.g. raise an exception if too much time is being spent on a simple operation such as a key insertion. This can be done using timers, signals or even under OS control.  The easiest way to protect against the hash collision attack is by limiting the POST/GET/HEAD request size.  The second best way would be to limit the number of parameters that a web framework accepts for POST/GET/HEAD request.  2. Changing the semantics of hashing in a dot release is not allowed.  If randomization of the hash start vector or some other method is enabled by default in a dot release, this will change the semantics of any application switching to that dot release.  The hash values of Python objects are not only used by the Python dictionary implementation, but also by other storage mechanisms such as on-disk dictionaries, inter-process object exchange via share memory, memcache, etc.  Hence, if changed, the hash change should be disabled per default for dot releases and enabled for 3.3.  3. Changing the way strings are hashed doesn't solve the problem.  Hash values of other types can easily be guessed as well, e.g. take integers which use a trivial hash function.  We'd have to adapt all hash functions of the basic types in Python or come up with a generic solution using e.g. double-hashing in the dictionary/set implementations.  4. By just using a random start vector you change the absolute hash values for specific objects, but not the overall hash sequence or its period.  An attacker only needs to create many hash collisions, not specific ones. It's the period of the hash function that's important in such attacks and that doesn't change when moving to a different start vector.  5. Hashing needs to be fast.  It's one of the most used operations in Python. Please get experts into the boat like Tim Peters and Christian Tismer, who both have worked on the dict implementation and the hash functions, before experimenting with ad-hoc fixes.  6. Counting collisions could solve the issue without having to change hashing.  Another idea would be counting the collisions and raising an exception if the number of collisions exceed a certain threshold.  Such a change would work for all hashable Python objects and protect against the attack without changing any hash function.

| ``` To expand on Marc-Andre's point 1: the DOS attack on web servers is possible because servers are generally dumb at the first stage. Upon receiving a post request, all key=value pairs are mindlessly packaged into a hash table that is then passed on to a page handler that typically ignores the invalid keys.  However, most pages do not need any key,value pairs and forms that do have a pre-defined set of expected and recognized keys. If there were a possibly empty set of keys associated with each page, and the set were checked against posted keys, then a DOS post with thousands of effectively random keys could quickly (in O(1) time) be rejected as erroneous.  In Python, the same effect could be accomplished by associating a class with slots with each page and having the server create an instance of the class. Attempts to create an undefined attribute would then raise an exception. Either way, checking input data for face validity before processing it in a time-consuming way is one possible solution for nearly all web pages and at least some other applications. ``` | | | |

For GET and HEAD, web servers normally already apply such limitations at rather low levels:  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/686217/maximum-on-http-header-values>  So only HTTP methods which carry data in the body part of the HTTP request are effected, e.g. POST and various WebDAV methods.  > The second best way would be to limit the number of parameters that a > web framework accepts for POST/GET/HEAD request.  Depending on how parsers are implemented, applications taking XML/JSON/XML-RPC/etc. as data input may also be vulnerable, e.g. non validating XML parsers which place element attributes into a dictionary or a JSON parser that has to read the JSON version of the dict I generated earlier on. ``` | | | |

| ``` This is not something that can be fixed by limiting the size of POST/GET.   Parsing documents (even offline) can generate these problems. I can create books that calibre (a Python-based ebook format shifting tool) can't convert, but are otherwise perfectly valid for non-python devices. If I'm allowed to insert usernames into a database and you ever retrieve those in a dict, you're vulnerable. If I can post things one at a time that eventually get parsed into a dict (like the tag example), you're vulnerable. I can generate web traffic that creates log files that are unparsable (even offline) in Python if dicts are used anywhere. Any application that accepts data from users needs to be considered.  Even if the web framework has a dictionary implementation that randomizes the hashes so it's not vulnerable, the entire python standard library uses dicts all over the place. If this is a problem which must be fixed by the framework, they must reinvent every standard library function they hope to use.  Any non-trivial python application which parses data needs the fix. The entire standard library needs the fix if is to be relied upon by applications which accept data. It makes sense to fix Python.  Of course we must fix all the basic hashing functions in python, not just the string hash. There aren't that many.   Marc-Andre: If you look at my proposed code, you'll notice that we do more than simply shift the period of the hash. It's not trivial for an attacker to create colliding hash functions without knowing the key.  Since speed is a concern, I think that the proposal to avoid using the random hash for short strings is a good idea. Additionally, randomizing only some of the characters in longer strings will allow us to improve security without compromising speed significantly.  I suggest that we don't randomize strings shorter than 6 characters. For longer strings, we randomize the first and last 5 characters. This means we're only adding additional work to a max of 10 rounds of the hash, and only for longer strings. Collisions with the hash from short strings should be minimal. ``` | | | |

It doesn't mean that it is not possible, just that I don't have a strong background in crytography :-)  I don't expect that adding 2 XOR would change our dummy (fast but unsafe) hash function into a cryptographic hash function. We cannot have security for free. If we want a strong cryptographic hash function, it would be much slower (Paul wrote that it would be 4x slower). But we prefer speed over security, so we have to do compromise.  I don't know if you can retreive hash values in practice. I suppose that you can only get hash(str) & (size - 1) with size=size of the dict internal array, so only the lower bits. Using a large dict, you may be able to retreive more bits of the hash value. ``` | | | |

The entire standard library needs the fix if is to be relied upon by applications which accept data. It makes sense to fix Python.  Agreed: Limiting the size of POST requests only applies to *web* applications. Other applications will need other fixes.  Trying to fix the problem in general by tweaking the hash function to (apparently) make it hard for an attacker to guess a good set of colliding strings/integers/etc. is not really a good solution. You'd only be making it harder for script kiddies, but as soon as someone crypt-analysis the used hash algorithm, you're lost again.  You'd need to use crypto hash functions or universal hash functions if you want to achieve good security, but that's not an option for Python objects, since the hash functions need to be as fast as possible (which rules out crypto hash functions) and cannot easily drop the invariant "a=b => hash(a)=hash(b)" (which rules out universal hash functions, AFAICT).  IMO, the strategy to simply cap the number of allowed collisions is a better way to achieve protection against this particular resource attack. The probability of having valid data reach such a limit is low and, if configurable, can be made 0.  > Of course we must fix all the basic hashing functions in python, not just the string hash.

It's not trivial for an attacker to create colliding hash functions without knowing the key.  Could you post it on the ticket ?  BTW: I wonder how long it's going to take before someone figures out that our merge sort based list.sort() is vulnerable as well... its worst-case performance is O(n log n), making attacks somewhat harder. The popular quicksort which Python used for a long time has O(n²), making it much easier to attack, but fortunately, we replaced it with merge sort in Python 2.3, before anyone noticed ;-) ``` | | | |

The attack doesn't work with short strings? What do you call a "short string"?  Well, the demonstrated collision is for 16 character ascii strings. Worst case UTF-8, we're looking at 3 manipulable bytes per character, but they may be harder to collide since some of those bytes are fixed.  > only be making it harder for script kiddies, but as soon as someone > crypt-analysis the used hash algorithm, you're lost again.  Not true. What I propose is to make the amount of information necessary to analyze and generate collisions impractically large. My proposed hash function is certainly broken if you brute force the lookup table. There are undoubtedly other problems with it too. The point is that it's hard enough. We aren't going for perfect security - we're going for enough to make this attack impractical.  What are the downsides to counting collisions? For one thing, it's something that needs to be kept track of on a per-dict basis, and can't be cached the way the hash results are. How do you choose a good value for the limit? If you set it to something conservative, you still pay the collision price every time a dict  is created to discover that the keys collide. This means that it's possible to feed to bad data up to exactly the limit, and suddenly the python app is inexplicably slow. If you set the limit too aggressively, then sometimes valid data gets caught, and python randomly dies in hard to debug ways with an error the programmer has never seen in testing and cannot reproduce.  It adds a new way to kill most python applications, and so programs are going to have to be re-written to cope with it. It also introduces a new place to cause errors - if the WSGI server dies, it's hard for my application to catch that and recover gracefully.  >... not in Python itself, but if you consider all the types in Python > extensions and classes implementing __hash__ in user code, the number > of hash functions to fix quickly becomes unmanageable.  When we looked at the Django project, we wouldn't have anything to fix since ours end up relying on the python internal values eventually. I suspect a lot of other code is similar.  Mark said: >What is the mechanism by which the attacker can determine the seeds?  The biggest information leak is probably the ordering in which dict entries are returned. This can be used to deduce the underlying hash values. This is much easier than trying to do it via timing.  > But that's not the issue we are supposed to be dealing with. > A single (genuinely random) seed will deal with the attack described in  > the talk and it is (almost) as fast as using 0 as a seed.  This is not true. A single random seed shifts the hash table, but does not actually prevent an attacker from generating collisions.

I don't know how long it is, the code to generate collisions is not public yet. I suppose than generating collisions is longer if we change the hash function to add more instructions (I don't know how much).  If generating the collisions requires a farm of computers / GPUs / something else and 7 days, it doesn't matter if it's easy to retreive the secret.  If the attack wants to precompute collisions for all possible seeds, (s)he will also have to store them. With 64 bits of entropy, if an attack is 1 byte long, you have to store 2^64 bytes (16,777,216 TB).  It is a problem if it takes less than a day with a desktop PC to generate data for an attack.

| ``` Those who use or advocate a simple randomized starting hash (Perl, Ruby, perhaps MS, and the CCC presenters) are presuming that the randomized hash values are kept private. Indeed, they should be (and the docs could note this) unless an attacker has direct access to the interpreter. An attacker who does, as in a Python programming class, can much more easily freeze the interpreter by 'accidentally' writing code equivalent to "while True: pass".  I do not think we, as Python developers, should be concerned about esoteric timing attacks. They strike me as a site issue rather than a language issue. As I understand them, they require *large* numbers of probes coupled with responses based on the same hash function. So a site being so probed already has bit of a problem. And if hashing were randomized per process, and probes were randomly distributed among processes, and processes were periodically killed and restarted with new seeds, could such an attack get anywhere (besides the DOS effect of the probing)? The point of the CCC talk was that with one constant known hash, one could lock up a server for a long while with just one upload.  So I think we should copy Perl and Ruby, do the easy thing, and add a random seed to 3.3 hashing, subject to keeping equality for equal numbers. Let whatever thereby fails, fail, and be updated. For prior versions, add an option for strings and perhaps numbers, and document that some tests will fail if enabled.  We could also consider, for 3.3, making the output of hash() be different from the internal values used for dicts, perhaps by switching random seeds in hash(). So even if someone does return hash(x) values to potential attackers, they are not the values used in dicts. (This would require a slight change in the doc.) ``` | | | |

| ``` Before continuing down the road of adding randomness to hash functions, please have a good read of the existing dictionary implementation:  """ Major subtleties ahead:  Most hash schemes depend on having a "good" hash function, in the sense of simulating randomness.  Python doesn't:  its most important hash functions (for strings and ints) are very regular in common cases:  [0, 1, 2, 3] >>> map(hash, ("namea", "nameb", "namec", "named")) [-1658398457, -1658398460, -1658398459, -1658398462] >>>  This isn't necessarily bad!  To the contrary, in a table of size 2**i, taking the low-order i bits as the initial table index is extremely fast, and there are no collisions at all for dicts indexed by a contiguous range of ints. The same is approximately true when keys are "consecutive" strings.  So this gives better-than-random behavior in common cases, and that's very desirable. ... """  There's also a file called dictnotes.txt which has more interesting details about how the implementation is designed.  Please note that the term "collision" is used in a slightly different way: it refers to trying to find an empty slot in the dictionary table. Having a collision implies that the hash values of two distinct objects are the same, but you also get collisions in case two distinct objects with different hash values get mapped to the same table entry.  An attack can be based on trying to find many objects with the same hash value, or trying to find many objects that, as they get inserted into a dictionary, very often cause collisions due to the collision resolution algorithm not finding a free slot.  In both cases, the (slow) object comparisons needed to find an empty slot is what makes the attack practical, if the application puts too much trust into large blobs of input data - which is the actual security issues we're trying to work around here...  Given the dictionary implementation notes, I'm even less certain that the randomization change is a good idea. It will likely introduce a performance hit due to both the added complexity in calculating the hash as well as the reduced cache locality of the data in the dict table.  I'll upload a patch that demonstrates the collisions counting strategy to show that detecting the problem is easy. Whether just raising an exception is a good idea, is another issue.  It may be better to change the tp_hash slot in Python 3.3 to take an argument, so that the dict implementation can use the hash function as universal hash family function (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hash>).  The dict implementation could then alter the hash parameter and recreate the dict table in case the number of collisions exceeds a certain limit, thereby actively taking action instead of just relying on randomness solving the issue in most cases. ``` | | | |

It's only used as local variable in the lookup function.  Note that the limit only triggers on a per-key basis.

This is clever. You basically neuter the attack as you notice it but everything else is business as usual. I'm concerned that this may end up being costly in some edge cases (e.g. look up how many collisions it takes to force the recreation, and then aim for just that many collisions many times). Unfortunately, each dict object has to discover for itself that it's full of offending hashes. Another approach would be to neuter the offending object by changing its hash, but this would require either returning multiple values, or fixing up existing dictionaries, neither of which seems feasible. ``` | | | |

I ran some experiments with the collision counting patch and could not trigger it in normal applications, not even in cases that are documented in the dict implementation to have a poor collision resolution behavior (integers with zeros the the low bits). The probability of having to deal with dictionaries that create over a thousand collisions for one of the key objects in a real life application appears to be very very low.  Still, it may cause problems with existing applications for the Python dot releases, so it's probably safer to add it in a disabled-per-default form there (using an environment variable to adjust the setting). For 3.3 it could be enabled per default and it would also make sense to allow customizing the limit using a sys module setting.  The idea with adding a parameter to the hash method/slot in order to have objects provide a hash family function instead of a fixed unparametrized hash function would probably have to be implemented as additional hash method, e.g. .__uhash__() and tp_uhash ("u" for universal).  The builtin types should then grow such methods in order to make hashing safe against such attacks. For objects defined in 3rd party extensions, we would need to encourage implementing the slot/method as well. If it's not implemented, the dict implementation would have to fallback to raising an exception.  Please note that I'm just sketching things here. I don't have time to work on a full-blown patch, just wanted to show what I meant with the collision counting idea and demonstrate that it actually works as intended. ``` | | | |

I wouldn't worry about that, because nobody could stir up anguish about it by writing a paper ;-)  1. O(n log n) is enormously more forgiving than O(n**2).  2. An attacker need not be clever at all:  O(n log n) is not only sort()'s worst case, it's also its _expected_ case when fed randomly ordered data.  3.

| ``` Given Martin's comment (<msg150832>) I guess I should add my suggestion to this issue, at least for the record.  Rather than change hash functions, randomization could be added to those dicts that are subject to attack by wanting to store user-supplied key values.  The list so far seems to be   urllib.parse, cgi, json  Some have claimed there are many more, but without enumeration.  These three are clearly related to the documented issue.  The technique would be to wrap dict and add a short random prefix to each key value, preventing the attacker from supplier keys that are known to collide... and even if he successfully stumbles on a set that does collide on one request, it is unlikely to collide on a subsequent request with a different prefix string.  The technique is fully backward compatible with all applications except those that contain potential vulnerabilities as described by the researchers. The technique adds no startup or runtime overhead to any application that doesn't contain the potential vulnerabilities.  Due to the per-request randomization, the complexity of creating a sequence of sets of keys that may collide is enormous, and requires that such a set of keys happen to arrive on a request in the right sequence where the predicted prefix randomization would be used to cause the collisions to occur.  This might be possible on a lightly loaded system, but is less likely on a system with heavy load, which are more interesting to attack.

I haven't done any profiling on this yet, but will run some tests.  The lookup functions in the dict implementation are optimized to make the first non-collision case fast. The patch doesn't touch this loop. The only change is in the collision case, where an increment and comparison is added (and then only after the comparison which is the real cost factor in the loop). I did add a printf() to see how often this case occurs - it's a surprisingly rare case, which suggests that Tim, Christian and all the others that have invested considerable time into the implementation have done a really good job here.  BTW: I noticed that a rather obvious optimization appears to be missing from the Python dict initialization code: when passing in a list of (key, value) pairs, the implementation doesn't make use of the available length information and still starts with an empty (small) dict table and then iterates over the pairs, increasing the table size as necessary. It would be better to start with a table that is presized to O(len(data)). The dict implementation already provides such a function, but it's not being used in the case dict(pair_list). Anyway, just an aside. ``` | | | |

The code has many issues:   * it is exceedingly complex  * the method would need to be implemented for all hashable    Python types  * it causes startup time to increase (you need urandom data for    every single hashable Python data type)  * it causes run-time to increase due to changes in the hash    algorithm (more operations in the tight loop)  * causes different processes in a multi-process setup to use different    hashes for the same object  * doesn't appear to work well in embedded interpreters that    regularly restarted interpreters (AFAIK, some objects persist across    restarts and those will have wrong hash values in the newly started    instances)  The most important issue, though, is that it doesn't really protect Python against the attack - it only makes it less likely that an adversary will find the init vector (or a way around having to find it via crypt analysis).  OTOH, the collision counting patch is very simple, doesn't have the performance issues and provides real protection against the attack. Even better still, it can detect programming errors in hash method implementations.  IMO, it would be better to put efforts into refining the collision detection patch (perhaps adding support for the universal hash method slot I mentioned) and run some real life tests with it. ``` | | | |

Really ? What about the much simpler attack on integer hash values ?  You only have to send a specially crafted JSON dictionary with integer keys to a Python web server providing JSON interfaces in order to trigger the integer hash attack.  The same goes for the other Python data types.  >>  * it causes startup time to increase (you need urandom data for >>   every single hashable Python data type) >  > My patch reads 8 or 16 bytes from /dev/urandom which doesn't block.

Your patch only implements the simple idea of adding an init vector and a fixed suffix vector (which you don't need since it doesn't prevent hash collisions).  I don't think that's good enough, since it doesn't change how the hash algorithm works on the actual data, but instead just shifts the algorithm to a different sequence. If you apply the same logic to the integer hash function, you'll see that more clearly.  Paul's algorithm is much more secure in this respect, but it requires more random startup data.  >>  * it causes run-time to increase due to changes in the hash >>   algorithm (more operations in the tight loop) >  > I posted a micro-benchmark on hash(str) on python-dev: the overhead is > nul. Did you have numbers showing that the overhead is not nul?  For the simple solution, that's an expected result, but if you want more safety, then you'll see a hit due to the random data getting XOR'ed in every single loop.  >>  * causes different processes in a multi-process setup to use different >>   hashes for the same object >  > Correct.

So you have the choice of being able to work in a multi-process environment and be vulnerable to the attack or not. I think we can do better :-)  Note that web servers written in Python tend to be long running processes, so an attacker has lots of time to test various seeds.  >>  * doesn't appear to work well in embedded interpreters that >>   regularly restarted interpreters (AFAIK, some objects persist across >>   restarts and those will have wrong hash values in the newly started >>   instances) >  > test_capi runs _testembed which restarts a embedded interpreters 3 > times, and the test pass (with my patch version 5).

I changed my patch to only generate the secret once.  Ok, that should fix the case.  Two more issue that I forgot:   * enabling randomized hashing can make debugging a lot harder, since    it's rather difficult to reproduce the same state in a controlled    way (unless you record the hash seed somewhere in the logs)  and even though applications should not rely on the order of dict repr()s or str()s, they do often enough:   * randomized hashing will result in repr() and str() of dictionaries    to be random as well  >> The most important issue, though, is that it doesn't really >> protect Python against the attack - it only makes it less >> likely that an adversary will find the init vector (or a way >> around having to find it via crypt analysis). >  > I agree that the patch is not perfect.

I don't know about real protection: you can still slow down dict construction by 1000x (the number of allowed collisions per lookup), which can be enough combined with a brute-force DOS.

Looks like XML-RPC also doesn't accept integers as dict keys. That's good :-)  However, as Paul already noted, such attacks can also occur in other places or parsers in an application, e.g. when decoding FORM parameters that use integers to signal a line or parameter position (example: value_1=2&value_2=3...) which are then converted into a dictionary mapping the position integer to the data.  marshal and pickle are vulnerable, but then you normally don't expose those to untrusted data. ``` | | | |

On my slow dev machine 1000 collisions run in around 22ms:  python2.7 -m timeit -n 100 "dict((x*(2**64 - 1), 1) for x in xrange(1, 1000))" 100 loops, best of 3: 22.4 msec per loop  Using this for a DOS attack would be rather noisy, much unlike sending a single POST.  Note that the choice of 1000 as limit is rather arbitrary. I just chose it because it's high enough because it's very unlikely to be hit by an application that is not written to trigger it and it's low enough to still provide a good run-time behavior. Perhaps an even lower figure would be better.  > Also, how about false positives? Having legitimate programs break > because of legitimate data would be a disaster.  Yes, which is why the patch should be disabled by default (using an env var) in dot-releases. It's probably also a good idea to make the limit configurable to adjust to ones needs.  Still, it is *very* unlikely that you run into real data causing more than 1000 collisions for a single insert.  For full protection the universal hash method idea would have to be implemented (adding a parameter to the hash methods, so that they can be parametrized). This would then allow switching the dict to an alternative hash implementation resolving the collision problem, in case the implementation detects high number of collisions. ``` | | | |

Note that sending one POST is not enough, unless the attacker is content with blocking *one* worker process for a couple of seconds or minutes (which is a rather tiny attack if you ask me :-)). Also, you can combine many dicts in a single JSON list, so that the 1000 limit isn't overreached for any of the dicts.  So in all cases the attacker would have to send many of these POST requests in order to overwhelm the target machine. That's how DOS attacks work AFAIK.  > Yes, which is why the patch should be disabled by default (using > an env var) in dot-releases.

Possibly, yes. Depends on whether anyone comes up with a problem in the alpha, beta, RC release cycle.  It would be great to have the universal hash method approach for Python 3.3. That way Python could self-heal itself in case it finds too many collisions. My guess is that it's still better to raise an exception, though, since it would uncover either attacks or programming errors. ``` | | | |

Right, but such an approach only scales linearly and doesn't exhibit the quadric nature of the collision resolution.  The above with 10000 items takes 5 seconds on my machine. The same with 100000 items is still running after 16 minutes.  > So in all cases the attacker would have to send many of these POST > requests in order to overwhelm the target machine. That's how DOS > attacks work AFAIK.  Depends :-) Hiding a few tens of such requests in the input stream of a busy server is easy. Doing the same with thousands of requests is a lot harder.  FWIW: The above dict string version just has some 263kB for the 100000 case, 114kB if gzip compressed.  >> Yes, which is why the patch should be disabled by default (using >> an env var) in dot-releases.

I would personally prefer 3.3 and even 3.2 to have proper randomization (either Paul's or Victor's or another proposal). Victor's proposal makes fixing other hash functions very simple (there could even be helper macros). The only serious concern IMO is startup time under Windows; someone with Windows-fu should investigate that.  2.x maintainers might want to be more conservative, although disabling a fix (the collision counter) by default doesn't sound very wise or helpful to me.

| ``` I must be missing something, but how is raising an exception when a collision threshold is reached a good thing? Basically, we're just exchanging a DoS for another (just feed the server process with ad-hoc data and he'll commit suicide). Sure, the caller can catch the exception to detect this, but what for? Restart the process, so that the attacker can just try again? Also, there's the potential of perfectly legit applications breaking. IMHO, randomization is the way to go, so that an attacker cannot generate a set of colliding values beforehand, which renders the attack impracticle. The same idea is behind ASLR used in modern kernels, and AFAICT, has been chosen by other implementations. If a such patch has a negligible performance impact, then it should definitely be enabled by default. People who want deterministic hashing (maybe to bypass an application bug, or just because the want determinism) can disable it if they really want to. ``` | | | |

| ``` I'd like to add a few notes:  1. both 32-bit and 64-bit python are vulnerable 2. collision-counting will break other things 3. imho, randomization is the way to go, enabled by default. 4. do we need a steady hash-function later again?  I created ~500KB of colliding strings for both 32-bit and 64-bit python. It works impressively good:  32bit: ~500KB payload keep django busy for >30 minutes. 64bit: ~500KB payload keep django busy for 5 minutes.  Django is more vulnerable than python-dict alone, because it * converts the strings to unicode first, making the comparision more expensive * does 5 dict-lookups per key.  So Python's dict of str alone is probably ~10x faster. Of course it's much harder to create the payload for 64-bit python than for 32-bit, but it works for both.  The collision-counting idea makes some sense in the web environment, but for other software types it can causes serious problems.  I don't want my software to stop working because someone managed to enter 1000 bad strings into it. Think of a software that handles names of customers or filenames. We don't want it to break completely just because someone entered a few clever names.  Randomization fixes most of these problems.  However, it breaks the steadiness of hash(X) between two runs of the same software. There's probably code out there that assumes that hash(X) always returns the same value: database- or serialization-modules, for example.  There might be good reasons to also have a steady hash-function available. The broken code is hard to fix if no such a function is available at all. Maybe it's possible to add a second steady hash-functions later again?  For the moment I think the best way is to turn on randomization of hash() by default, but having a way to turn it off. ``` | | | |

Think of a software that handles names of customers or filenames. We don't want it to break completely just because someone entered a few clever names.  Collision counting is just a simple way to trigger an action. As I mentioned in my proposal on this ticket, raising an exception is just one way to deal with the problem in case excessive collisions are found. A better way is to add a universal hash method, so that the dict can adapt to the data and modify the hash functions for just that dict (without breaking other dicts or changing the standard hash functions).  Note that raising an exception doesn't completely break your software. It just signals a severe problem with the input data and a likely attack on your software. As such, it's no different than turning on DOS attack prevention in your router.  In case you do get an exception, a web server will simply return a 500 error and continue working normally.  For other applications, you may see a failure notice in your logs. If you're sure that there are no possible ways to attack the application using such data, then you can simply disable the feature to prevent such exceptions.  > Randomization fixes most of these problems.

| ``` Right back at the start it was said:  """ We haven't agreed whether the randomization should be enabled by default or disabled by default. IMHO it should be disabled for all releases except for the upcoming 3.3 release. The env var PYTHONRANDOMHASH=1 would enable the randomization. It's simple to set the env var in e.g. Apache for mod_python and mod_wsgi. """  with a environment variable PYTHONHASHSEED still being mentioned towards the end.  Be aware that a user being able to set an environment variable which is used on Python interpreter initialisation when using mod_python or mod_wsgi is not as trivial as made out in leading comment.  To set an environment variable would require the setting of the environment variable to be done in the Apache etc init.d scripts, or if the Apache distro still follows Apache Software Foundation conventions, in the 'envvars' file.  Having to do this requires root access and is inconvenient, especially since where it needs to be done differs between every distro.  Where there are other environment variables that are useful to set for interpreter initialisation, mod_wsgi has been changed in the past to add specific directives for the Apache configuration file to set them prior to interpreter initialisation. This at least makes it somewhat easier, but still only of help where you are the admin of the server.  If that approach is necessary, then although mod_wsgi could eventually add such a directive, as mod_python is dead it will never happen for it.  As to another question posed about whether mod_wsgi itself is doing anything to combat this, the answer is no as don't believe there is anything it can do. Values like the query string or post data is simply passed through as is and always pulled apart by the application. ``` | | | |

The precision of the script is quite bad because Windows timer has a bad resolution (e.g. 15.6 ms on Windows 7) :-/  In release mode, the best startup time is 45.2 ms without random, 50.9 ms with random: an overhead of 5.6 ms (12%).  My script uses PYTHONHASHSEED=0 to disable the initialization of CryptoGen. You may modify the script to compare an unpatched Python with a patched Python for better numbers.  An overhead 12% is important. random-6.patch contains a faster (but also weaker) RNG on Windows, disable at compilation time. Search "#if 1" at the end of random.c. It uses my linear congruential generator (LCG) initialized with gettimeofday() and getpid() (which are known to be weak) instead of CryptoGen.

| ``` To be more explicit about Martin A. Lemburg's <msg151121> (which I agree with):  Count the collisions on a single lookup.  If they exceed a threshhold, do something different.  Martin's strawman proposal was threshhold=1000, and raise.  It would be just as easy to say "whoa!  5 collisions -- time to use the alternative hash instead" (and, possibly, to issue a warning).    Even that slight tuning removes the biggest objection, because it won't ever actually fail.  Note that the use of a (presumably stronger 2nd) hash wouldn't come into play until (and unless) there was a problem for that specific key in that specific dictionary.  For the normal case, nothing changes -- unless we take advantage of the existence of a 2nd hash to simplify the first few rounds of collision resolution.  (Linear probing is more cache-friendly, but also more vulnerable to worst-case behavior -- but if probing stops at 4 or 8, that may not matter much.)  For quick scripts, the 2nd hash will almost certainly never be needed, so startup won't pay the penalty.  The only down side I see is that the 2nd (presumably randomized) hash won't be cached without another slot, which takes more memory and shouldn't be done in a bugfix release. ``` | | | |

Don't you think that the number of corrections you have to apply in order to get the tests working again shows how much impact such a change would have in real-world applications ?

Personally I don't think the change in dict order is a problem (hashing already changes between 32-bit and 64-bit builds, and we sometimes change the calculation too: it might change *more* often with random hashes, while it went unnoticed in some cases before). So only (b) is a problem and I don't think it affects more than 0.01% of applications/users :) ``` | | | |

I don't think that we need two fixes for a single vulnerability (in the same Python version), one is enough. If we decide to count collisions, the randomized hash idea can be simply dropped. But we may use a different fix for Python 3.3 and for stable versions (e.g. count collisions for stable versions and use randomized hash for 3.3).  > BTW: The patch still includes the unnecessary _Py_unicode_hash_secret.suffix > which needlessly complicates the code and doesn't any additional > protection against hash value collisions  How does it complicate the code? It adds an extra XOR to hash(str) and 4 or 8 bytes in memory, that's all. It is more difficult to compute the secret from hash(str) output if there is a prefix *and* a suffix. If there is only a prefix, knowning a single hash(str) value is just enough to retrieve directly the secret. . > I don't think it affects more than 0.01% of applications/users :)  It would help to try a patched Python on a real world application like Django to realize how much code is broken (or not) by a randomized hash function. ``` | | | |

For the purposes of 3.3 I'd prefer to just have randomized hashing and not the collision counting in order to keep things from getting too complicated.  But I will not object if we opt to do both.  As much as the counting idea rubs me wrong, even if it were on by default I agree that most non-contrived things will never encounter it and it is easy to document how to work around it by disabling it should anyone actually be impeded by it.  The concern I have with that approach from a web service point of view is that it too can be gamed in the more rare server situation of someone managing to fill a persistent data structure up with enough colliding values to be _close_ to the limit such that the application then dies while trying to process all future requests that _hit_ the limit (a persisting 500 error DOS rather than an exception raised only in one offending request that deserved that 500 error anyways). Not nearly as likely a scenario but it is one I'd keep an eye open for with an attacker hat on.  MvL's suggestion of using AVL trees for hash bucket slots instead of our linear slot finding algorithm is a better way to fix the ultimate problem by never devolving into linear behavior at all. It is naturally more complicated but could likely even be done while maintaining ABI compatibility. I haven't pondered designs and performance costs for that. Possibly a memory hit and one or two extra indirect lookups in the normal case and some additional complexity in the iteration case.  -gps ``` | | | |

I think that was DJB's DNS server/cache actually. But deciding to limit collisions in a specific application is not the same as limiting them in the general case.

Successful anticipation and blocking of hash attack: after a chain of  100 DNS 'treats the request as a cache miss'. What is somewhat special  for this app is being able to bail at that point.

That would help for both approaches, indeed.  Please note, that you'd have to extend the randomization to all other Python data types as well in order to reach the same level of security as the collision counting approach.  As-is the randomization patch does not solve the integer key attack and even though parsers such as JSON and XML-RPC aren't directly affected, it is well possible that stringified integers such as IDs are converted back to integers later during processing, thereby triggering the attack.  Note that the integer attack also applies to other number types in Python:  (3, 3, 3)  See Tim's post I referenced earlier on for the reasons. Here's a quick summary ;-) ...  {3: 3} ``` | | | |

Looks like a limit lower than 1000 would already do just fine.

But without the suffix, I can pretty easy and efficient guess the prefix by just seeing the result of a few well-chosen and short repr(dict(X)). I suppose that's harder with the suffix.  Since the hash function is known, it doesn't make things much harder. Without suffix you just need hash('') to find out what the prefix is. With suffix, two values are enough.  Say P is your prefix and S your suffix. Let's say you can get the hash values of A = hash('') and B = hash('\x00').  With Victor's hash function you have (IIRC):  A = hash('')     = P ^ (0<<7) ^ 0 ^ S = P ^ S B = hash('\x00') = ((P ^ (0<<7)) * 1000003) ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ S = (P * 1000003) ^ 1 ^ S  Let X = A ^ B, then  X = P ^ (P * 1000003) ^ 1  since S ^ S = 0 and 0 ^ Y = Y (for any Y), i.e. the suffix doesn't make any difference.  For P < 500000, you can then easily calculate P from X using:  P = X // 1000002  (things obviously get tricky once overflow kicks in)  Note that for number hashes the randomization doesn't work at all, since there's no length or feedback loop involved.  With Victor's approach hash(0) would output the whole seed, but even if the seed is not known, creating an attack data set is trivial, since hash(x) = P ^ x ^ S. ``` | | | |

With my patch, hash('') always return zero. I don't remember who asked me to do that, but it avoids to leak too easily the secret :-) I wrote some info how to compute the secret: <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg150706>  I don't see how to compute the secret, but it doesn't mean that it is impossible :-) I suppose that you have to brute force some bits, at least if you only have repr(dict) which gives only (indirectly) the lower bits of the hash.  > (things obviously get tricky once overflow kicks in)  hash() doesn't overflow: if you know the string, you can run the algorithm backward. To divide, you can compute 1/1000003 mod 2^32 (or mod 2^64): [2021759595](https://hg.python.org/lookup/2021759595) and 16109806864799210091.

I suppose that it would be too simple to compute the secret of a randomized integer hash, so it is maybe better to leave them unchanged. Using a different secret from strings and integer would not protect Python against an attack only using integers, but integer keys are less common than string keys (especially on web applications).  Anyway, I changed my mind about randomized hash: I now prefer counting collisions :-) ``` | | | |

With suffix, two values are enough  This is obvious and absolutely correct!  But it's not what I talked about. I didn't talk about the result of hash(X), but about the result of repr(dict([(str: val), (str: val)....])), which is more likely to happen and not so trivial (if you want to know more than the last 8 bits)  IMHO this problem shows that we can't advice dict() or set() for (potential dangerous) user-supplied keys at the moment.  I prefer randomization because it fixes this problem. The collision-counting->exception prevents a software from becoming slow, but it doesn't make it work as expected.  Sure, you can catch the exception. But when you get the exception, probably you wanted to add the items for a reason: Because you want them to be in the dict and that's how your software works.  Imagine an irc-server using a dict to store the connected users, using the nicknames as keys. Even if the irc-server catches the unexpected exception while connecting a new user (when adding his/her name to the dict), an attacker could connect 999 special-named users to prevent a specific user from connecting in future.  Collision-counting->exception can make it possible to inhibit a specific future add to the dict. The outcome is highly application dependent.  I think it fixes 95% of the attack-vectors, but not all and it adds a few new risks. However, of course it's much better then doing nothing to fix the problem. ``` | | | |

That's not what I suggested. Keys would be considered equal if they are indeed equal (__eq__). The hash value is just used to know if the key belongs to the left or the right child tree. With a self-balanced binary search tree, you'd still get O(log(N)) complexity.  Anyway, I still think that the hash randomization is the right way to go, simply because it does solve the problem, whereas the collision counting doesn't: Martin made a very good point on python-dev with his database example. ``` | | | |

For completeness, I quote Martin here:  """ The main issue with that approach is that it allows a new kind of attack.  An attacker now needs to find 1000 colliding keys, and submit them one-by-one into a database. The limit will not trigger, as those are just database insertions.  Now, if the applications also as a need to read the entire database table into a dictionary, that will suddenly break, and not for the attacker (which would be ok), but for the regular user of the application or the site administrator.  So it may be that this approach actually simplifies the attack, making the cure worse than the disease. """  Martin is correct in that it is possible to trick an application into building some data pool which can then be used as indirect input for an attack.  What I don't see is what's wrong with the application raising an exception in case it finds such data in an untrusted source (reading arbitrary amounts of user data from a database is just as dangerous as reading such data from any other source).  The exception will tell the programmer to be more careful and patch the application not to read untrusted data without additional precautions.  It will also tell the maintainer of the application that there was indeed an attack on the system which may need to be tracked down.  Note that the collision counting demo patch is trivial - I just wanted to demonstrate how it works. As already mentioned, there's room for improvement:  If Python objects were to provide an additional method for calculating a universal hash value (based on an integer input parameter), the dictionary in question could use this to rehash itself and avoid the attack. Think of this as "randomization when needed". (*)  Since the dict would still detect the problem, it could also raise a warning to inform the maintainer of the application.  So you get the best of both worlds and randomization would only kick in when it's really needed to keep the application running. ``` | | | |

If the hash output depends on an argument, the result cannot be cached. So I suppose that dictionary lookups become slower than the dictionary switches to the randomized mode. It would require to add an optional argument to hash functions, or add a new function to some (or all?) builtin types. ``` | | | |

Of course, but then the collision counting approach loses its main advantage over randomized hashing: smaller patch, easier to backport. If you need to handle a potential abnormal number of collisions anyway, why not account for it upfront, instead of drastically complexifying the algorithm? While larger, the randomization is conceptually simpler.  The only argument in favor the collision counting is that it will not break applications relying on dict order: it has been argued several times that such applications are already broken, but that's of course not an easy decision to make, especially for stable versions... ``` | | | |

With collision counting, there are no additional operations unless and until there is at least one collision -- in other words, after the base hash algorithm has already started to fail for that particular piece of data.  In fact, the base algorithm can be safely simplified further, precisely because it does not need to be quite as adequate for reprobes on data that does have at least one collision. ``` | | | |

If collision counting prevents the DoS attack that may be "work as expected", assuming you believe (as I do) that "real life" data won't ever have that many collisions.  Note that every web service is vulnerable to some form of DoS where a sufficient number of malicious requests will keep all available servers occupied so legitimate requests suffer delays and timeouts. The defense is to have sufficient capacity so that a potential attacker would need a large amount of resources to do any real damage. The hash collision attack vastly reduces the amount of resources needed to bring down a service; crashing early moves the balance of power significantly back, and that's all we can ask for.  Sure, you can catch the exception. But when you get the exception, > probably you wanted to add the items for a reason: Because you want > them to be in the dict and that's how your software works. >  No, real data would never make this happen, so it's a "don't care" case (at least for the vast majority of services). An attacker could also send you such a large amount of data that your server runs out of memory, or starts swapping (which is almost worse). But that requires for the attacker to have enough bandwidth to send you that data. Or they could send you very many requests. Same requirement.  All we need to guard for here is the unfortunate multiplication of the attacker's effort due to the behavior of the collision-resolution code in the dict implementation.

They can still be cached in a separate dict based on id, rather than string contents.  It may also be possible to cache them in the dict itself; for a string-only dict, the hash of each entry is already cached on the object, and the cache member of the entry is technically redundant. Entering a key with the alternative hash can also switch the lookup function to one that handles that possibility, just as entering a non-string key currently does.  > It would require to add an > optional argument to hash functions, or add a new function to some > (or all?) builtin types.

Note that the test cases deliberately avoid containing > "hostile" data.  I had a brainstorm, and I don't yet know if the following makes sense, but here's a crude patch with another approach, which might get around the issues Frank raises.  Rather than count the number of equal-hash collisions within each call to lookdict, instead keep a per-dict count of the total number of iterations through the probe sequence (regardless of the hashing), amortized across all calls to lookdict, and if it looks like we're going O(n^2) rather than O(n), raise an exception.  Actually, that's not quite it, but see below...  We potentially have 24 words of per-dictionary storage hiding in the ma_smalltable area within PyDictObject, which we can use when ma_mask >= PyDict_MINSIZE (when mp->ma_table != mp->ma_smalltable), without changing sizeof(PyDictObject) and thus breaking ABI.  I hope there isn't any code out there that uses this space.  (Anyone know of any?)  This very crude patch uses that area to add per-dict tracking of the total number of iterations spent probing for a free PyDictEntry whilst constructing the dictionary.  It rules that if we've gone more than (32 * ma_used) iterations whilst constructing the dictionary (counted across all ma_lookup calls), then we're degenerating into O(n^2) behavior, and this triggers an exception.  Any other usage of ma_lookup resets the count (e.g. when reading values back).  I picked the scaling factor of 32 from out of the air; I hope there's a smarter threshold.    I'm assuming that an attack scenario tends to involve a dictionary that goes through a construction phase (which the attacker is aiming to change from O(N) to O(N^2)), and then a usage phase, whereas there are other patterns of dictionary usage in which insertion and lookup are intermingled for which this approach wouldn't raise an exception.  This leads to exceptions like this:  AlgorithmicComplexityError: dict construction used 4951 probes for 99 entries at key 99 with hash 42  (i.e. the act of constructing a dict with 99 entries required traversing 4951 PyDictEntry slots, suggesting someone is sending deliberately awkward data).  Seems to successfully handle both the original DoS and the second scenario in Frank's email.  I don't have a reproducer for the first of Frank's scenarios, but in theory it ought to handle it.  (I hope!)  Have seen two failures within python test suite from this, which I hope can be fixed by tuning the thresholds and the reset events (they seem to happen when a large dict is emptied).  May have a performance impact, but I didn't make any attempt to optimize it (beyond picking a power of two for the scaling factor).

Does some > key distribution allow the attack while circumventing the protection?  Yes, I agree that I was making an unrealistic assumption about usage patterns.  There was also some global state (the "is_inserting" variable).  I've tweaked the approach somewhat, moved the global to be per-dict, and am attaching a revised version of the patch:    amortized-probe-counting-dmalcolm-2012-01-21-003.patch  In this patch, rather than reset the count each time, I keep track of the total number of calls to insertdict() that have happened for each "large dict" (i.e. for which ma_table != ma_smalltable), and the total number of probe iterations that have been needed to service those insertions/overwrites.  It raises the exception when the *number of probe iterations per insertion* exceeds a threshold factor (rather than merely comparing the number of iterations against the current ma_used of the dict).  I believe this means that it's tracking and checking every time the dict is modified, and (I hope) protects us against any data that drives the dict implementation away from linear behavior (because that's essentially what it's testing for).  [the per-dict stats are reset each time that it shrinks down to using ma_smalltable again, but I think at-risk usage patterns in which that occurs are uncommon relative to those in which it doesn't].  When attacked, this leads to exceptions like this: AlgorithmicComplexityError: dict construction used 1697 probes whilst performing 53 insertions (len() == 58) at key 58 with hash 42  i.e we have a dictionary containing 58 keys, which has seen 53 insert/overwrite operations since transitioning to the non-ma_smalltable representation (at size 6); presumably it has 128 PyDictEntries. Servicing those 53 operations has required a total 1697 iterations through the probing loop, or a little over 32 probes per insert.  I just did a full run of the test suite (using run_tests.py), and it mostly passed the new tests I've added (included the test for scenario 2 from Frank's email).  There were two failures: ====================================================================== FAIL: test_inheritance (test.test_pep352.ExceptionClassTests) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AssertionError: 1 != 0 : {'AlgorithmicComplexityError'} not accounted for ---------------------------------------------------------------------- which is obviously fixable (given a decision on where the exception lives in the hierarchy)  and this one: test test_mutants crashed -- Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/home/david/coding/python-hg/cpython-count-collisions/Lib/test/regrtest.py", line 1214, in runtest_inner     the_package = __import__(abstest, globals(), locals(), [])   File "/home/david/coding/python-hg/cpython-count-collisions/Lib/test/test_mutants.py", line 159, in <module>     test(100)   File "/home/david/coding/python-hg/cpython-count-collisions/Lib/test/test_mutants.py", line 156, in test     test_one(random.randrange(1, 100))   File "/home/david/coding/python-hg/cpython-count-collisions/Lib/test/test_mutants.py", line 132, in test_one     dict2keys = fill_dict(dict2, range(n), n)   File "/home/david/coding/python-hg/cpython-count-collisions/Lib/test/test_mutants.py", line 118, in fill_dict     Horrid(random.choice(candidates)) AlgorithmicComplexityError: dict construction used 2753 probes whilst performing 86 insertions (len() == 64) at key Horrid(86) with hash 42 though that seems to be deliberately degenerate code.

We're interested in the actual slowdown factor, which a constant factor models adequately. It's the slowdown factor which makes a DOS attack using this technique efficient. Whether or not dict construction truely degenerates into a O(n**2) operation is less relevant.  There needs to be a way to disable it: an environment variable would be the minimum IMO. Also, in 3.3 there should probably be a sys function to enable or disable it at runtime. Not sure it should be backported since it's a new API. ``` | | | |

| ``` Well, the old attempt was hardly robust :)  Can anyone see any vulnerabilities in this approach?  Yeah; I was mostly trying to add raw data (to help me debug the implementation).  I wonder if the dict statistics should be exposed with extra attributes or a method on the dict; e.g. a __stats__ attribute, something like this:  LargeDictStats(keys=58, mask=127, insertions=53, iterations=1697)  SmallDictStats(keys=3, mask=7)  or somesuch. Though that's a detail, I think.  > > Caveats: > > * no overflow handling (what happens after 2**32 modifications to a > > long-lived dict on a 32-bit build?) - though that's fixable. >  > How do you suggest to fix it?  If the dict is heading towards overflow of these counters, it's either long-lived, or *huge*.  Possible approaches: (a) use 64-bit counters rather than 32-bit, though that's simply delaying the inevitable (b) when one of the counters gets large, divide both of them by a constant (e.g. 2).  We're interested in their ratio, so dividing both by a constant preserves this.  By "a constant" do you mean from the perspective of big-O notation, or do you mean that it should be hardcoded (I was wondering if it should be a sys variable/environment variable etc?).  > We're interested in the actual slowdown factor, which a constant factor > models adequately.

A real issue, though, may be the cost of 64-bit arithmetic on 32-bit CPUs.  > (b) when one of the counters gets large, divide both of them by a > constant (e.g. 2).

| ``` 5 more characters: PYTHONHASHTABLEPROTECTION or PYHASHTABLEPROTECTION maybe?  I'm in *both* camps: I like hash seed randomization fwiw.  I'm nervous about enabling either of the approaches by default, but I can see myself backporting both approaches into RHEL's ancient Python versions, compiled in, disabled by default, but available at runtime via env vars (assuming that no major flaws are discovered in my patch e.g. performance).  I'm sorry if I'm muddying the waters by working on this approach.  Is the hash randomization approach ready to go, or is more work needed? If the latter, is there a clear TODO list? (for backporting to 2.*, presumably we'd want PyStringObject to be randomized; I think this means that PyBytesObject needs to be randomized also in 3.*; don't we need hash(b'foo') == hash('foo') ?).  Does the patch needs to also randomize the hashes of the numeric types? (I think not; that may break too much 3rd-party code (NumPy?)).  [If we're bikeshedding,  I prefer the term "salt" to "seed" in the hash randomization approach: there's a per-process "hash salt", which is either randomly generated, or comes from the environment, set to 0 to disable] ``` | | | |

This and the problems Frank mentions are my primary concerns about the counting approach. Without the original suggestion of modifying the hash and continuing without an exception (which has its own set of problems), the "valid data python can't process" problem is a pretty big one. Allowing attackers to poison interactions for other users is unacceptable.  The other thing I haven't seen mentioned yet is that while it is true that most web applications do have robust error handling to produce proper 500s, an unexpected error will usually result in restarting the server process - something that can carry significant weight by itself. I would consider it a serious problem if every attack request required a complete application restart, a la original cgi.  I'm strongly in favor of randomization. While there are many broken applications in the wild that depend on dictionary ordering, if we ship with this feature disabled by default for security and bugfix branches, and enable it for 3.3, users can opt-in to protection as they need it and as they fix their applications. Users who have broken applications can still safely apply the security fix (without even reading the release notes) because it won't change the default behavior. Distro managers can make an appropriate choice for their user base. Most importantly, it negates the entire "compute once, attack everywhere" class of collision problems, even if we haven't explicitly discovered them. ``` | | | |

It doesn't address this issue - though if the page is taking many hours to render, is that in practice less unviewable that everyone getting an immediate exception with (perhaps) a useful error message?  Unfortunately, given the current scale factor, my patch may make it worse: in my tests, this approach rejected malicious data much more quickly than the old collision-counting one, which I thought was a good thing - but then I realized that this means that an attacker adopting the strategy you describe would have to do less work to trigger the exception than to trigger the slowdown.  So I'm not convinced my approach flies, and I'm leaning towards working on the hash randomization patch rather than pursuing this.  I need sleep though, so I'm not sure the above is coherent Dave ``` | | | |

| ``` I arbitrarily started with 50, and then decided a power of two would be quicker when multiplying.  There wasn't any rigorous analysis behind the choice of factor.  Though, as noted in <msg151796>, I've gone off this idea, since I think the "protection" creates additional avenues of attack.  I think getting some kind of hash randomization patch into the hands of users ASAP is the way forward here (even if disabled by default).  If we're going to support shipping backported versions of the hash randomization patch with the randomization disabled, did we decide on a way of enabling it?  If not, then I propose that those who want to ship with it disabled by default standardize on (say):    PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION  as an environment variable: if set to nonzero, it enables hash randomization (reading the random seed as per the 3.3. patch, and respecting the PYTHONHASHSEED variable if that's also set).  If set to zero or not present, hash randomization is disabled.  Does that sound sane?  (we can't use PYTHONHASHSEED for this, since if a number is given, that means "use this number", right?)  FWIW, I favor hash randomization in 2.* for PyStringObject, PyUnicodeObject, PyBufferObject, and the 3 datetime classes in [Modules/_datetimemodule.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/_datetimemodule.c) (see the implementation of generic_hash in that file), but to not do it for the numeric types.  Sorry; I only tried it on the python test suite (and on a set of reproducers for the DoS that I've written for RH's in-house test suite). ``` | | | |

Martin's example is really just a red herring: it doesn't matter where the hostile data originates or how it gets into the application. There are many ways an attacker can get the O(n^2) worst case timing triggered.  Frank's example is an attack on the second possible way to trigger the O(n^2) behavior. See <msg150724> further above where I listed the two possibilities:  """ An attack can be based on trying to find many objects with the same hash value, or trying to find many objects that, as they get inserted into a dictionary, very often cause collisions due to the collision resolution algorithm not finding a free slot. """  My demo patch only addresses the first variant. In order to cover the second variant as well, you'd have to count and limit the number of iterations in the perturb for-loop of the lookdict() functions where the hash value of the slot does not match the key's hash value.  Note that the second variant is both a lot less likely to trigger (due to the dict getting resized on a regular basis) and the code involved a lot faster than the code for the first variant (which requires a costly object comparison), so the limit for the second variant would have to be somewhat higher than for the first.  BTW: The collision counting patch chunk for the string dicts in my demo patch is wrong. I've attached a corrected version. In the original patch it was counting both collision variants with the same counter and limit. ``` | | | |

I think you're asking a bit much here :-) A broken app is a broken app, no matter how nice Python tries to work around it. If an app puts too much trust into user data, it will be vulnerable one way or another and regardless of how the user data enters the app.  These are the collision counting possibilities we've discussed so far:  With an collision counting exception you'd get a clear notice that something in your data and your application is wrong and needs fixing. The rest of your web app will continue to work fine and you won't run into a DoS problem taking down all of your web server.  With the proposed enhancement of collision counting + universal hash function for Python 3.3, you'd get a warning printed to the logs, the dict implementation would self-heal and your page is viewable nonetheless. The admin would then see the log entry and get a chance to fix the problem.  Note: Even if Python works around the problem successfully, there's no guarantee that the data doesn't end up being processed by some other tool in the chain with similar problems. All this is a work-around for an application bug, nothing more. Silencing the problem by e.g. using randomization in the string hash algorithm doesn't really help in identifying the bug.  Overall, I don't think we should make Python's hash function non-deterministic. Even with the universal hash function idea, the dict implementation should use a predefined way of determining the next hash parameter to use, so that running the application twice against attack data will still result in the same data output. ``` | | | |

| ``` I'm attaching an attempt at backporting haypo's random-8.patch to 2.7  Changes relative to random-8.patch:     * The randomization is off by default, and must be enabled by setting      a new environment variable PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION to a non-empty string.      (if so then, PYTHONHASHSEED also still works, if provided, in the same      way as in haypo's patch)     * All of the various "Py_hash_t" become "long" again (Py_hash_t was      added in 3.2: [issue9778](issue9778 "[closed] Make hash values the same width as a pointer (or Py_ssize_t)"))     * I expanded the randomization from just PyUnicodeObject to also cover      these types:       * PyStringObject       * PyBufferObject       The randomization does not cover numeric types: if we change the hash of      int so that hash(i) no longer equals i, we also have to change it      consistently for long, float, complex, decimal.Decimal and      fractions.Fraction; however, there are 3rd-party numeric types that      have their own __hash__ implementation that mimics int.__hash__ (see      e.g. numpy)       As noted in <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151063> and      <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151064>, it's not possible      to directly create a dict with integer keys via JSON or XML-RPC.       This seems like a tradeoff between the risk of attack via other means      vs breakage induced by not having hash() == hash() for the various      equivalent numerical representations in pre-existing code.     * To support my expanded usage of the random secret, I moved:                PyAPI_DATA(_Py_unicode_hash_secret_t) _Py_unicode_hash_secret       from unicodeobject.h to object.h and renamed it to:         PyAPI_DATA(_Py_HashSecret_t) _Py_HashSecret;       This also exposes it for usage by C extension modules, just in case      they need it (Murphy's Law suggests we will need if we don't expose      it).   This is an extension of the API, but warranted, I feel.  My      plan for downstream RHEL is to add this explicitly to the RPM metadata      as a "Provides" of the RPM providing libpython.so so that if something      needs to use it, it can express a "Requires" on it; I assume that      something similar is possible with .deb)     * generalized test_unicode.HashTest to support the new env var and the      additional types.  In my version, get_hash takes a _repr string rather      than an object, so that I can test it with a buffer().  Arguably the      tests should thus be moved from test_unicode to somewhere else, but this      location keeps things consistent with haypo's patch.       haypo: in random-8.patch, within test_unicode.HashTest.test_null_hash,      "hash_empty" seems to be misnamed     * dropped various selftest fixes where the corresponding selftests don't      exist in 2.7     * adds a description of the new environment variables to the manpage;      arguably this should be done for the patch for the default branch also  Caveats:     * only tested on Linux (Fedora 15 x86_64); not tested on Windows.

Running (part of (*)) the test suite with debugging enabled on a 64-bit machine shows that slot collisions are much more frequent than hash collisions, which only account for less than 0.01% of all collisions.  It also shows that slot collisions in the low 1-10 range are most frequent, with very few instances of a dict lookup reaching 20 slot collisions (less than 0.0002% of all collisions).  The great number of cases with 1 or 2 slot collisions surprised me. It seems that there's potential for improvement of the perturbation formula left.  Due to the large number of 1 or 2 slot collisions, the patch is going to cause a minor hit to dict lookup performance. It may make sense to unroll the slot search loop and only start counting after the third round of misses.

Were you planning on writing those, or leaving that for others?  As a developer, I honestly don't know how I can state with certainty that input data is clean or not, until I actually see the error you propose. I can't check validity before the fact, the way I can check for invalid unicode before storing it in my database. Once I see the error (probably only after my application is attacked, certainly not during development), it's too late. My application can't know which particular data triggered the error, so it can't delete it. I'm reduced to trial and error to remove the offending data, or to writing code that never stores more than 1000 things in a dictionary. And I have to accept that the standard library may not work on any particular data I want to process, and must write code that detects the error state and somehow magically removes the offending data.  The alternative, randomization, simply means that my dictionary ordering is not stable, something that is already the case.  While I appreciate that the counting approach feels cleaner; randomization is the only solution that makes practical sense. ``` | | | |

Even 1 in 10,000 seems pretty high, though I suppose it is a result of non-random input.  (For a smalldict with 8 == 2^3 slots, on a 64-bit machine, true hash collisions "should" only account for 1 in 2^61 slot collisions.)  > It also shows that slot collisions in the low 1-10 range are > most frequent, with very few instances of a dict lookup > reaching 20 slot collisions (less than 0.0002% of all > collisions).  Thus the argument that collisions > N implies (possibly malicious) data that really needs a different hash -- and that this dict instance in particular should take the hit to use an alternative hash.  (Do note that this alternative hash could be stored in the hash member of the PyDictEntry; if anything actually *equal* to the key comes along, it will have gone through just as many collisions, and therefore also have been rehashed.)  > The great number of cases with 1 or 2 slot collisions surprised > me. It seems that there's potential for improvement of > the perturbation formula left.  In retrospect, this makes sense.      for (perturb = hash; ; perturb >>= PERTURB_SHIFT) {         i = (i << 2) + i + perturb + 1;  If two objects collided then they have the same last few last few bits in their hashes -- which means they also have the same last few bits in their initial perturb.  And since the first probe is to slot 6i+1, it funnels down to only even consider half the slots until the second probe.  Also note that this explains why Randomization could make the Django tests fail, even though 64-bit users haven't complained.  The initial hash(&mask) is the same, and the first probe is the same, and (for a small enough dict) so are the next several.  In a dict with 2^12 slots, the first 6 tries will be the same ... so I doubt the test cases have sufficiently large amounts of sufficiently unlucky data to notice very often -- unless the hash itself is changed, as in the patch. ``` | | | |

Exactly.  I would NOT worry about hash repeatability for integers and complex data structures.  It is not at the core of the common problem (maybe a couple application specific problems but not a general "all python web apps" severity problem).  Doing it for base byte string and unicode string like objects is sufficient.  Good catch on doing it for buffer objects, I'd forgotten about those. ;)  A big flaw with haypo's patch is that it only considers unicode instead of all byte-string-ish stuff.  (the code in [issue13704](issue13704 "[closed] Random number generator in Python core") does that better).  > >   * To support my expanded usage of the random secret, I moved: > >       PyAPI_DATA(_Py_unicode_hash_secret_t) _Py_unicode_hash_secret > >     from unicodeobject.h to object.h and renamed it to: > >       PyAPI_DATA(_Py_HashSecret_t) _Py_HashSecret; > >     This also exposes it for usage by C extension modules, just in case >     they need it (Murphy's Law suggests we will need if we don't expose >     it).   This is an extension of the API, but warranted, I feel.  My >     plan for downstream RHEL is to add this explicitly to the RPM metadata >     as a "Provides" of the RPM providing libpython.so so that if something >     needs to use it, it can express a "Requires" on it; I assume that >     something similar is possible with .deb)  Exposing this is good.

| ``` I'm attaching a patch which implements a hybrid approach:   hybrid-approach-dmalcolm-2012-01-25-001.patch  This is a blend of various approaches from the discussion, taking aspects of both hash randomization *and* collision-counting.  It incorporates code from   amortized-probe-counting-dmalcolm-2012-01-21-003.patch   backport-of-hash-randomization-to-2.7-dmalcolm-2012-01-23-001.patch   random-8.patch along with ideas from:   <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-January/115812.html>  The patch is against the default branch (although my primary goal here is eventual backporting).  As per haypo's random-8.patch, a randomization seed is read at startup.  By default, the existing hash() values are preserved, and no randomization is performed until a dict comes under attack.  This preserves existing behaviors (such as dict ordering) under non-attack conditions.  For large dictionaries, it reuses the ma_smalltable area to track the amortized cost of all modifications to this dictionary.  When the cost exceeds a set threshold, we convert the dictionary's ma_lookup function from lookdict/lookdict_unicode to a "paranoid" variant.  These variants ignore the hash passed in, and instead uses a new function:    PyObject_RandomizedHash(obj) to give a second hash value, which is fixed value for a given object within the process, but not predictable to an attacker for the most high-risk types (PyUnicodeObject and PyBytesObject).  This patch is intended as a base for backporting, and takes it as given that we can't expand PyTypeObject or hide something in one of the Py*Methods tables; iirc we've run out of tp_flags in 2.*, hence we're forced to implement PyObject_RandomizedHash via direct ob_type comparison, for the most high-risk types.    As noted in <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151870>:  > I would NOT worry about hash repeatability for integers and > complex data structures.  It is not at the core of the common problem > (maybe a couple application specific problems but not a general "all > python web apps" severity problem).  > Doing it for base byte string and unicode string like objects is > sufficient.  [We can of course implement hash randomization by default in 3.3, but I care more about getting a fix into the released branches ASAP]  Upon transition of a dict to paranoid mode, the hash values become unpredictable to an attacker, and all PyDictEntries are rebuilt based on the new hash values.  Handling the awkward case within custom ma_lookup functions allows us to move most of the patch from out of the fast path, and lookdict/lookdict_unicode only need minimal changes (stat gathering for the above cost analysis tracking).  Once a dict has transitioned to paranoid mode, it isn't using PyObject_Hash anymore, and thus isn't using cached object values, performing a more expensive calculation, but I believe this calculation is essentially constant-time.  This preserves hash() and dict order for the cases where you're not under attack, and gracefully handles the attack without having to raise an exception: it doesn't introduce any new exception types.  It preserves ABI, assuming no-one else is reusing ma_smalltable.  It is suitable for backporting to 3.2, 2.7, and earlier (I'm investigating fixing this going all the way back to Python 2.2)  Under the old implementation, there were 4 types of PyDictObject, given these two booleans:   * "small vs large" i.e ma_table == ma_smalltable vs ma_table != ma_smalltable   * "all keys are str" vs arbitary keys i.e ma_lookdict == lookdict_unicode vs lookdict  Under this implementation, this doubles to 8 kinds, adding the boolean:   * normal hash vs randomized hash (normal vs "paranoid").  This is expressed via the ma_lookdict callback, adding two new variants, lookdict_unicode_paranoid and lookdict_paranoid  Note that if a paranoid dict goes small again (ma_table == ma_smalltable), it stays paranoid.  This is for simplicity: it avoids having to rebuild all of the non-randomized me_hash values again (which could fail).  Naturally the patch adds selftests.  I had to add some diagnostic methods to support them; dict gains _stats() and _make_paranoid() methods, and sys gains a _getrandomizedhash() method.  These could be hidden more thoroughly if need be (see DICT_PROTECTION_TRACKING in dictobject.c).  Amongst other things, the selftests measure wallclock time taken for various dict operations (and so might introduce failures on a heavily-loaded machine, I guess).  Hopefully this approach is a viable way forward.  Caveats and TODO items:  TODO: I haven't yet tuned the safety threshold.  According to <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151850>: > slot collisions are much more frequent than > hash collisions, which only account for less than 0.01% of all > collisions. > > It also shows that slot collisions in the low 1-10 range are > most frequent, with very few instances of a dict lookup > reaching 20 slot collisions (less than 0.0002% of all > collisions).  This suggests that the threshold of 32 slot/hash collisions per lookup may already be high enough.  TODO: in a review of an earlier version of the complexity detection idea, Antoine Pitrou suggested that make the protection scale factor be a run-time configurable value, rather than a #define.

I believe any performance issues ought to be fixable, in that the we can get the cost of this for the "we're not under attack" case to be negligible, and the "under attack" case should transition from O(N^2) to O(N), albeit it with a larger constant factor.

I'm attaching a revised version of the patch that should fix the above issue:   hybrid-approach-dmalcolm-2012-01-25-002.patch  Changes relative to -001.patch: * updated insertdict() so that when it write ep->me_hash, it uses the correct hash value.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a good way of reusing the value we calculated in the "paranoid" ma_lookup callbacks, without breaking ABI (suggestions welcome),  so we call PyObject_RandomizedHash again. * slightly reworked the two _paranoid ma_lookup callbacks to capture the randomized hash as a local variable, in case there's a way of reusing it in insertdict() * when lookdict() calls into itself, it now calls mp->ma_lookup instead * don't generate a fatal error with an unknown ma_lookup callback.  With this, I'm able to insert 200,000 non-equal PyUnicodeObject with hash()==0 into a dict on a 32-bit build --with-pydebug in 2.2 seconds; it can retrieve all the values correctly in about 4 seconds [compare with ~1.5 hours of CPU churn for inserting the same data on an optimized build without the patch on the same guest].  The amortized ratio of total work done per modification increases linearly when under an O(N^2) attack, and the dict switches itself to paranoid mode 56 insertions after ma_table stops using ma_smalltable (that's when we start tracking stats).  After the transition to paranoid mode, it drops to an average of a little under 2 probes per insertion (the amortized ratio seems to be converging to about 1.9 probes per key insertion at the point where my hostile test data runs out). ``` | | | |

| ``` > I'm attaching a revised version of the patch that should fix the above > issue: >   hybrid-approach-dmalcolm-2012-01-25-002.patch  It looks like that approach will break any non-builtin type (in either C or Python) which can compare equal to bytes or str objects. If that's the case, then I think the likelihood of acceptance is close to zero.  Also, the level of complication is far higher than in any other of the proposed approaches so far (I mean those with patches), which isn't really a good thing.  So I'm rather -1 myself on this approach, and would much prefer to randomize hashes in all conditions. ``` | | | |

As I read it, that couldn't happen, because paranoid dicts couldn't shrink at all.  (Not letting them shrink beneath 2*PyDict_MINSIZE does seem like a reasonable solution.)  Additional TODOs...  The checks for Unicode and Dict should not be exact; it is OK to do on a subclass so long as they are using the same lookdict (and, for unicode, the same eq).  Additional small strings should be excluded from the new hash, to avoid giving away the secret.  At a minimum, single-char strings should be excluded, and I would prefer to exclude all strings of length <= N (where N defaults to 4). ``` | | | |

If a third-party type wants to compare equal to bytes or str objects, its __hash__ method will usually end up calling hash() on the equivalent bytes/str object. That's especially true for Python types (I don't think anyone wants to re-implement a slow str-alike hash in pure Python).  > (2)  I think it would still work for the lookdict_string (or > lookdict_unicode) case ... which is the normal case, and also where > most vulnerabilities should appear.

I want something I can backport, though.  Well, your approach sounds like it subtly and unpredictably changes the behaviour of dicts when there are too many collisions, so I'm not sure it's a good idea to backport it, either.  If we don't want to backport full hash randomization, I think I much prefer raising a BaseException when there are too many collisions, rather than this kind of (excessively) sophisticated workaround. You *are* changing a fundamental datatype in a rather complicated way. ``` | | | |

| ``` I think you're right: it will stop matching it during lookup within such a dict, since the dict will be using the secondary hash for "abc", but hash() for the C instance.  It will still match outside of the dict, and within other dicts.  So yes, this would be a subtle semantic change when under attack. Bother.  Having said that, note that within the typical attack scenarios (HTTP headers, HTTP POST, XML-RPC, JSON), we have a pure-str dict (or sometimes a pure-bytes dict).  Potentially I could come up with a patch that only performs this change for such a case (pure-str is easier, given that we already track this), which would avoid the semantic change you identify, whilst still providing protection against a wide range of attacks.

Well, each approach has pros and cons, and we've circled around between hash randomization vs collision counting vs other approaches for several weeks.  I've supplied patches for 3 different approaches.  Is this discussion likely to reach a conclusion soon?  Would it be regarded as rude if I unilaterally ship something close to:   backport-of-hash-randomization-to-2.7-dmalcolm-2012-01-23-001.patch in RHEL/Fedora, so that my users have some protection they can enable if they get attacked? (see <http://bugs.python.org/msg151847>).  If I do this, I can post the patches here in case other distributors want to apply them.  As for python.org, who is empowered to make a decision here?

I don't think Fedora shipping its own patches can be considered "rude" by anyone else than its users.

Otherwise, we have the following data points:  - hash randomization is generally considered the cleanest solution - hash randomization cannot be enabled by default in bugfix, let alone security releases - collision counting can mitigate some of the attacks, although it can have weaknesses (see Frank's emails) and it comes with its own problems (breaking the program "later on")  So I'd suggest the following course of action: - ship and enable some form of collision counting on bugfix and security releases - ship and enable hash randomization in 3.3 ``` | | | |

[Obviously I'm not Martin, but his idea really interests me]  Looking at: <http://hg.python.org/sandbox/loewis/file/58be269aa0b1/Objects/dictobject.c#l517> as soon as any key insertion or lookup occurs where the key isn't exactly one of the correct types, the dict flattens any AVL trees back into the regular flat representation (and switches to lookdict for ma_lookup), analogous to the existing ma_lookup transition on dicts.  From my reading of the code, if you have a dict purely of bytes/str, collisions on a hash value lead to the PyDictEntry's me_key being set to an AVL tree.  All users of the ma_lookup callback within dictobject.c check to see if they're getting such PyDictEntry back.  If they are, they call into the tree, which leads to TREE_FIND(), TREE_INSERT() and TREE_DELETE() invocations as appropriate; ultimately, the AVL macros call back to within node_cmp():    PyObject_Compare(left->key, right->key)  [Martin, I'm sorry if I got this wrong]  So *if* I'm reading the code correctly, it might be possible to generalize it from {str, bytes} to any set of types within which ordering and equality checking of instances from any type is "sane", which loosely, would seem to be: that we can reliably compare all objects from any type within the set, so that we can use the comparisons to perform a search to hone in on a pair of keys that compare as "equal", without any chance of raising exceptions, or missing a valid chance for two objects to be equal etc.  I suspect that you can't plug arbitrary user-defined types into it, since there's no way to guarantee that ordering and comparison work in the ways that the AVL lookup requires.  But I could be misreading Martin's code.  [thinking aloud, if a pair of objects don't implement comparison at the PyObject_Compare level, is it possible to instead simply compare the addresses of the objects?  I don't think so, since you have a custom equality implementation in your UDT, but maybe I've missed something?]  Going higher-level, I feel that there are plenty of attacks against pure-str/bytes dicts, and having protection against them is worthwhile - even if there's no direct way to use it to protect the use-case you describe.

That's all true. It would be desirable to automatically determine which types also support total order in addition to hashing, alas, there is currently no protocol for it. On the contrary, Python has moved away of assuming that all objects form a total order.  > [thinking aloud, if a pair of > objects don't implement comparison at the PyObject_Compare level, is it > possible to instead simply compare the addresses of the objects?  2.x has an elaborate logic to provide a total order on objects. It took the entire 1.x and 2.x series to fix issues with that order, only to recognize that it is not feasible to provide one - hence the introduction of rich comparisons and the omission of cmp in 3.x.  For the dictionary, using addresses does not work: the order of objects needs to be consistent with equality (i.e. x < y and x == y must not simultaneously hold, as must x == y and y < z imply that also x < z, else the tree lookup won't find the equal keys).  > Going higher-level, I feel that there are plenty of attacks against > pure-str/bytes dicts, and having protection against them is worthwhile - > even if there's no direct way to use it to protect the use-case you > describe.  Indeed. This issue doesn't need to fix *all* possible attacks using hash collisions. Instead, it needs to cover the common case, and it needs to allow users to rewrite their code so that they can protect it against this family of attacks. ``` | | | |

Not necessarily: only if they use these strings as dictionary keys, and only if they do so in contexts where arbitrary user input is consumed.

| ``` I'm sorry then, but I'm a little confused.  I think we pretty clearly established earlier that requiring users to make changes anywhere they stored user data would be dangerous, because these locations are often in libraries or other places where the code creating and modifying the dictionary has no idea it's user data in it.  The proposed AVL solution fails if it requires users to fundamentally restructure their data depending on it's origin.  We have solution that is known to work in all cases: hash randomization.  There were three discussed issues with it:  a) Code assuming a stable ordering to dictionaries b) Code assuming hashes were stable across runs. c) Code reimplementing the hashing algorithm of a core datatype that is now randomized.  I don't think any of these are realistic issues the way "doesn't protect all cases" is.  (a) was never a documented, or intended property, indeed it breaks all the time, if you insert keys in the wrong order, use a different platform, or anything else can change.  (b) For the same reasons code relying on (b) only worked if you didn't change anything, and in practice I'm convinced neither of these were common (if ever existed).  Finally (c), while it's a concern, I've reviewed Django, SQLAlchemy, PyPy, and the stdlib: there is only one place where compatibility with a core-hash is attempted, decimal.Decimal.  In summary, I think the case against hash-randomization has been seriously overstated, and in no way is more dangerous than having a solution that fails to solve the problem comprehensively.  Further, I think it is imperative that we reach a consensus on this quickly, as the only reason this hasn't been widely exploited yet is the lack of availability of the data, when it becomes available I firmly expect just about every high profile Python site on the internet (of which there are many) to be attacked.

I don't consider that established for the specific case of string-like objects. Users can easily determine whether they use string-like objects, and if so, in what places, and what data gets put into them.  > The proposed AVL solution fails if it requires users to fundamentally > restructure their data depending on it's origin.  It doesn't fail at all. User don't *have* to restructure their code, let alone fundamentally. Their code may currently be vulnerable, yet not use string-like objects at all. With the proposed solution, such code will be fixed for good.  It's true that the solution does not fix all cases of the vulnerability, but neither does any other proposed solution.  > We have solution that is known to work in all cases: hash randomization.  Well, you *believe* that it fixes the problem, even though it actually may not, assuming an attacker can somehow reproduce the hash function.  >  There were three discussed issues with it: > > a) Code assuming a stable ordering to dictionaries > b) Code assuming hashes were stable across runs. > c) Code reimplementing the hashing algorithm of a core datatype that is now > randomized. > > I don't think any of these are realistic issues  I'm fairly certain that code will break in massive ways, despite any argumentation that it should not. The question really is  Do we break code in a massive way, or do we fix the vulnerability for most users with no code breakage?  I clearly value compatibility much higher than 100% protection against a DoS-style attack (which has many other forms of protecting against available also).  > (a) was never a documented, or intended property, indeed it > breaks all the time, if you insert keys in the wrong order, use a different > platform, or anything else can change.  Still, a lot of code relies on dictionary order, and successfully so, in practice. Practicality beats purity.  > (b) For the same reasons code > relying on (b) only worked if you didn't change anything  That's not true. You cannot practically change the way string hashing works other than by changing the interpreter source. Hashes *are* currently stable across runs.  > and in practice I'm convinced neither of these were common (if ever existed).  Are you willing to bet the trust people have in Python's bug fix policies on that?

Further, I think it is > imperative that we reach a consensus on this quickly  Well, I cannot be part of a consensus that involves massive code breakage in a bug fix release. Lacking consensus, either the release managers or the BDFL will have to pronounce. ``` | | | |

If I your read patch correctly, collisions will produce additional allocations of one distinct PyObject (i.e. AVL node) per colliding key. That's a pretty massive change in memory consumption for string dicts (and also in memory fragmentation and cache friendliness, probably). The performance effect in most situations is likely to be negative too, despite the better worst-case complexity.  IMO that would be a rather controversial change for a feature release, let alone a bugfix or security release.  It would be nice to have the release managers' opinions on this issue. ``` | | | |

It's not a massive change, as colliding hash values never happen in practice, unless you are being attacked, in which case it will be one additional PyObject for the set of all colliding keys (i.e. one object per possible hundreds of string objects). Even including the nodes of the tree (one per colliding node) is IMO a moderate increase in memory usage, in order to solve the vulnerability.  It also doesn't impact memory fragmentation badly, as these objects are allocated using the Python small objects allocator.  > The > performance effect in most situations is likely to be negative too, > despite the better worst-case complexity.  Compared to the status quo? Hardly. In all practical applications, collision never happens, so none of the extra code is ever exexcuted - except for AVL_Check invocations, which are a plain pointer comparison.  > IMO that would be a rather controversial change for a feature release, > let alone a bugfix or security release.  Apparently so, but it's not clear to me why that is. That change meets all criteria of a security fix release nicely, as opposed to the proposed changes to the hash function, which break existing code. ``` | | | |

Could the AVL tree approach be extended to apply to dictionaries containing keys of any single type that supports comparison?  That approach would autodetect UserString or similar and support it properly.  I expect that dictionaries with keys of more than one type to be very rare and highly unlikely when it comes to values generated directly via user input.  (and on top of all of this I believe we're all settled on having per interpreter hash randomization _as well_ in 3.3; but this AVL tree approach is one nice option for a backport to fix the major vulnerability)  -gps ``` | | | |

I think we would need a place to store the single key type, which, from an ABI point of view, might be difficult to find (but we could overload ma_smalltable for that, or reserve ma_table[0]).  In addition, I think it is difficult to determine whether a type supports comparison, at least in 2.x. For example,  class X:   def __eq__(self, o):     return self.a == o.a  allows to create objects x and y so that x<y<z, yet x==z.  For 3.x, we could assume that a failure to support comparison raises an exception, in which case we could just wait for the exception to happen, and then flatten the dictionary and start over with the lookup. This would extend even to mixed key types. ``` | | | |

The point I first missed is that this triggers only when the hash is *fully* equal; if the hashes are merely equal after masking, then today's try-another-slot approach will still be used, even for strings.  Per ( <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151850> ) Marc-Andre Lemburg's measurements, full-hash equality explains only 1 in 10,000 collisions.  From a performance standpoint, we can almost ignore a case that rare; it is almost certainly dwarfed by resizing.  I *am* a bit concerned that the possible contents of a dictentry change; this could cause easily-missed-in-testing breakage for anything that treats table as an array.  That said, it doesn't seem much worse than the search finger, and there seemed to be recent consensus that even promising an exact dict -- subclasses not allowed -- didn't mean that direct access was sanctioned.  So it still seems safer than changing the de-facto iteration order. ``` | | | |

This is indeed a concern: the new code needs to be exercised. I came up with a Py_REDUCE_HASH #define; if set, the dict will only use the lowest 3 bits of the hash, producing plenty collisions. In that mode, the branch currently doesn't work at all due to the remaining bugs. ``` | | | |

Perhaps we could combine my attack-detection code from    <http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151714> with Martin's AVL approach?  Use the ma_smalltable to track stats, and when a dict detects that it's under attack,  *if* all the keys are AVL-compatible, it could transition to full-AVL mode.

[See hybrid-approach-dmalcolm-2012-01-25-002.patch for the latest version of attack-detection; I'm working on a rewrite in which I restrict it to working just on pure-str dicts.  With that idea, when a dict detects that it's under attack, *if* all the keys satisfy this condition   (new_hash(keyA) == new_hash(keyB)) iff (hash(keyA) == hash(keyB)) then all hash values get recalculated using new_hash (which is randomized), which should offer protection in many common attack scenarios, without the semantic change Alex and Antoine indicated] ``` | | | |

Attached patch is for 3.1 and adds opt-in hash randomization.

New version of the patch for 3.1   optin-hash-randomization-for-3.1-dmalcolm-2012-01-28-001.patch  This version adds a command-line flag to enable hash-randomization: -R (given that the -E flag disables env vars and thus disabled PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION). See [1] below  [Is there a convenient way to check the length of the usage messages in [Modules/main.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/main.c)?  I see this comment:    /* Long usage message, split into parts < 512 bytes */ ]  I reworded the documentation somewhat based on input from Barry and Antoine.  Also adds a NEWS item.  Passes "make test" on this x86_64 Fedora 15 box, --with-pydebug, though that's without randomization enabled (it just does it within individual test cases that explicitly enable it).  No performance testing done yet (though hopefully similar to that of Victor's patch; see <msg151078>)  No idea of the impact on Windows users (I don't have a windows dev box). It still has the stuff from Victor's patch described in <msg151158>.  How is this looking? Dave  [1] IRC transcript concerning "-R" follows: <__ap__> dmalcolm: IMO it would be simpler if there was only one env var (preferably not too clumsy to type) <__ap__> also, despite being neither barry nor gutworth, I think the test suite *should* pass with randomized hashes <__ap__> :) <dmalcolm> :) <__ap__> also the failure you're having is a bit worrying, since apparently it's not about dict ordering <dmalcolm> PYTHONHASHSEED exists mostly for selftesting (also for compat, if you absolutely need to reproduce a specific random dict ordering) <__ap__> ok <__ap__> if -E suppresses hash randomization, I think we should also add a command-line flag <__ap__> -R seems untaken <__ap__> also it'll make things easier for Windows users, I think ``` | | | |

OK, though note that because it's random, I'll have to run it a few times, and we'll see what shakes out.  Am running with: $  make test TESTPYTHONOPTS=-R leading to:    ./python -E -bb -R ./Lib/test/regrtest.py -l   BTW, I see:   Testing with flags: sys.flags(debug=0, division_warning=0, inspect=0, interactive=0, optimize=0, dont_write_bytecode=0, no_user_site=0, no_site=0, ignore_environment=1, verbose=0, bytes_warning=2)  which doesn't list the new flag.  Should I add it to sys.flags?  (or does anyone ever do tuple-unpacking of that PyStructSequence and thus rely on the number of elements?) ``` | | | |

I think we at least need to identify (to the best of our ability) the tests that fail and include them in release notes.  If they're easy to fix, we should fix them.  Maybe also open a bug report for each failure.  I'm okay though with some tests failing in 2.6 with this environment variable set.  We needn't go back and fix them in 2.6 (since we're in security-fix only mode), but I'll bet you'll get almost the same set for 2.7 and there we *should* fix them, even if it happens after the release.  >What do the buildbots do?

I think this is bike-shedding. The requirements for environment variables are a) with no variable set, it must not do randomization b) there must be a way to seed from the platform's RNG Having an explicit seed actually is no requirement, so I'd propose to drop PYTHONHASHSEED instead.  However, I really suggest to let the patch author (Dave Malcolm) design the API within the constraints. ``` | | | |

The reason to read PYTHONHASHSEED was so that multiple members of a cluster could use the same hash.  It would have been nice to have fewer environment variables, but I'll grant that it is hard to say "use something random that we have *not* precomputed" without either a config file or a magic value for PYTHONHASHSEED.  -jJ ``` | | | |

I tried benchmarking the 2.6 version of the patch.  I reran "perf.py" 16 times, setting PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION=1, and --inherit_env=PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION so that the patched python uses the randomization, using a different hash for each run.  Some tests are slightly faster with the patch on some runs; some are slightly slower, and it appears to vary from run to run.  However, the amount involved is a few percent.  [compare e.g. with <msg151078>]  Here's the command I used. (for i in $(seq 16) ; do echo RUN $i ; (PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION=1 python ./perf.py --inherit_env=PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION ../cpython-2.6-clean/python ../cpython-2.6-hash-randomization/python) ; done) | tee results-16.txt  Am attaching the results. ``` | | | |

Thanks for testing this!  Oops, yes: Py_MIN is only present in "default" [it was added to [Include/Python.h](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/Python.h) (as PY_MIN) in 72475:8beaa9a37387 for [PEP 393](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/), renamed to Py_MIN in 72489:dacac31460c0, eventually reaching [Include/pymacro.h](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/pymacro.h) in 72512:36fc514de7f0]  "orig_size" in win32_urandom was apparently unused, so I've removed it.  I also found and fixed an occasional failure in my 2.6 backport of the new test_os.URandomTests.get_urandom_subprocess.

It is an issue. Not only in terms of startup time, but also because randomization per default makes Python behave in non-deterministc ways - which is not what you want from a programming language or interpreter (unless you explicitly tell it to behave like that).  I think it would be much better to just let the user define a hash seed using environment variables for Python to use and then forget about how this variable value is determined. If it's not set, Python uses 0 as seed, thereby disabling the seeding logic.  This approach would have Python behave in a deterministic way per default and still allow users who wish to use a different seed, set this to a different value - even on a case by case basis.  If you absolutely want to add a feature to have the seed set randomly, you could make a seed value of -1 trigger the use of a random number source as seed.  I also still firmly believe that the collision counting scheme should be made available via an environment variable as well. The user could then set the variable to e.g. 1000 to have it enabled with limit 1000, or leave it undefined to disable the collision counting.  With those two tools, users could then choose the method they find most attractive for their purposes.  By default, they would be disabled, but applications which are exposed to untrusted user data and use dictionaries for managing such data could check whether the protections are enabled and trigger a startup error if needed. ``` | | | |

It's not about being attractive, it's about fixing the security problem. The simple collision counting approach leaves a gaping hole open, as demonstrated by Frank. ``` | | | |

The problematic case is, roughly,  (1)  Find out what N will trigger collision-counting countermeasures. (2)  Insert N-1 colliding entries, to make it as slow as possible.

Since N is constant, I don't see how such an "attack" could be used to trigger the O(n^2) worst-case behavior. Even if you can create n sets of entries that each fill up N-1 positions, the overall performance will still be O(n*N*(N-1)/2) = O(n).  So in the end, we're talking about a regular brute force DoS attack, which requires different measures than dictionary implementation tricks :-)  BTW: If you set the limit N to e.g. 100 (which is reasonable given Victor's and my tests), the time it takes to process one of those sets only takes 0.3 ms on my machine. That's hardly usable as basis for an effective DoS attack. ``` | | | |

Agreed; it tops out with a constant, but if it takes only 16 bytes of input to force another run through a 1000-long collision, that may still be too much leverage.  > BTW: If you set the limit N to e.g. 100 (which is reasonable given > Victor's and my tests),  Agreed.

You should prepare the dict so that you have the collisions-run with a one-byte string or better with an even empty string, not a 16 bytes string.  > BTW: If you set the limit N to e.g. 100 (which is reasonable given > Victor's and my tests),  100 is probably hard to exploit for a DoS attack.

Here's what I get: tale a dictionary with 100 integer collisions: d = dict((x*(2**64 - 1), 1) for x in xrange(1, 100))  The repr(d) has 2713 bytes, which is a good approximation of how much (string) data you have to send in order to trigger the problem case.  If you can create 3333 distinct integer sequences, you'll get a processing time of about 1 second on my slow dev machine. The resulting dict will likely have a repr() of around 60*3333*2713 = 517MB.  So you need to send 517MB to cause my slow dev machine to consume 1 minute of CPU time. Today's servers are at least 10 times as fast as my aging machine.  If you then take into account that the integer collision dictionary is a very efficient collision example (size vs. effect), the attack doesn't really sound practical anymore. ``` | | | |

We won't be back-porting anything more than the hash randomization for 2.6/2.7/3.1/3.2 but we are free to do more in 3.3 if someone can demonstrate it working well and a need for it.  For me, things like collision counting and tree based collision buckets when the types are all the same and known comparable make sense but are really sounding like a lot of additional complexity. I'd *like* to see active black-box design attack code produced that goes after something like a wsgi web app written in Python with hash randomization *enabled* to demonstrate the need before we accept additional protections like this  for 3.3+.  -gps ``` | | | |

A simple seed xor'ed with the hash won't work, since the attacks I posted will continue to work (just colliding on a different hash value).  Using a more elaborate hash algorithm would slow down uses of numbers as dictionary keys and also be difficult to implement for non-integer types such as float, longs and complex numbers. The reason is that Python applications expect x == y => hash(x) == hash(y), e.g. hash(3) == hash(3L) == hash(3.0) == hash(3+0j).  AFAIK, the randomization patch also doesn't cover tuples, which are rather common as dictionary keys as well, nor any of the other more esoteric Python built-in hashable data types (e.g. frozenset) or hashable data types defined by 3rd party extensions or applications (simply because it can't). ``` | | | |

I wouldn't necessarily take that for granted: since container types usually calculate their hash based on the hashes of their elements, it's possible that a clever combination of elements could lead to a neutralization of the the hash seed used by the elements, thereby reenabling the original attack on the unprotected interpreter.  Still, because we have far more vulnerable hashable types out there, trying to find such an attack doesn't really make practical sense, so protecting containers is indeed not as urgent :-) ``` | | | |

I don't believe Marc-Andre's concerns are a sufficient rebuttal to the approach I've taken.  If anyone is aware of an attack via numeric hashing that's actually possible, please let me know (privately).  I believe only specific apps could be affected, and I'm not aware of any such specific apps. ``` | | | |

Any application reading user provided data from a file, database, web, etc. is vulnerable to the attack, if it uses the read numeric data as keys in a dictionary.  The most common use case for this is a dictionary mapping codes or IDs to strings or objects, e.g. for caching purposes, to find a list of unique IDs, checking for duplicates, etc.  This also works indirectly on 32-bit platforms, e.g. via date/time or IP address values that get converted to key integers. ``` | | | |

PYTHONHASHSEED has to be a string anyhow, so why not just get rid of PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION?  Use PYTHONHASHSEED=random to use randomization.  Other values that cannot be turned into an integer will be (currently) undefined.  (You may want to raise a fatal error, on the assumption that errors should not pass silently.)  A missing PYTHONHASHSEED then has the pleasant interpretation of defaulting to "0" for backwards compatibility. ``` | | | |

The changes to the docs in the latest patch clarifies the meaning of what I've implemented (I hope).  My view is that we should simply enable hash randomization by default in 3.3  At that point, PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION and the -R option become meaningless (and could be either removed, or silently ignored), and you have to set PYTHONHASHSEED=0 to get back the old behavior. ``` | | | |

| ``` The bug report is the easiest thing to search for and follow when checking when something is resolved so it is nice to have a link to the relevant patch(es) for each branch.  I just wanted to note the major commit here so that all planned branches had a note recorded.  I don't care that it wasn't automatic. :)  For observers: There have been several more commits related to fixing this (test dict/set order fixes, bug/typo/merge oops fixes for the linked to patches, etc). Anyone interested in seeing the full list of diffs should look at their specific branch on our around the time of the linked to changelists.  Too many to list here. ``` | | | |

| ``` Question: Should sys.flags.hash_randomization be True (1) when PYTHONHASHSEED=0?  It is now.  Saying yes "working as intended" is fine by me.  sys.flags.hash_randomization seems to simply indicate that doing something with the hash seed was explicitly specified as opposed to defaulting to off, not that the hash seed was actually chosen randomly.  What this implies for 3.3 after we make hash randomization default to on is that sys.flags.hash_randomization will always be 1. ``` | | | |

The flag should probably be removed - simply because the env var is not a flag, it's a configuration parameter.  Exposing the seed value as sys.hashseed would be better and more useful to applications. ``` | | | |

PYTHONHASHSEED=1 will disable randomization as well :-)  Only setting PYTHONHASHSEED=random actually enables randomization. ``` | | | |

Okay, after chatting with __ap__ on irc, here's what I think the behavior should be:  sys.flags.hash_randomization should contain just the value given by the -R flag.  It should only be True if the flag is present, False otherwise.  sys.hash_seed contains the hash seed, set by virtue of the flag or envar.  It should contain the *actual* seed value used.  E.g. it might be zero, the explicitly set integer, or the randomly selected seed value in use during this Python execution if a random seed was requested.  If you really need the envar value, getenv('PYTHONHASHSEED') is good enough for that. ``` | | | |

| ``` I have to amend my suggestion about sys.flags.hash_randomization.  It needs to be non-zero even if $PYTHONHASHSEED is given instead of -R.  Many other flags that also have envars work the same way, e.g. -O and $PYTHONOPTIMIZE.  So hash_randomization has to work the same way.  I'll still work on a patch for exposing the seed in sys. ``` | | | |

# [Python-Dev] Hash collision security issue (now public)

Hello all,

A paper (well, presentation) has been published highlighting security problems with the hashing algorithm (exploiting collisions) in many programming languages Python included:

	 <http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007_28C3_Effective_DoS_on_web_application_platforms.pdf>

Although it's a security issue I'm posting it here because it is now public and seems important.

The issue they report can cause (for example) handling an http post to consume horrible amounts of cpu. For Python the figures they quoted:

	reasonable-sized attack strings only for 32 bits Plone has max. POST size of 1 MB
	7 minutes of CPU usage for a 1 MB request
	~20 kbits/s → keep one Core Duo core busy

This was apparently reported to the security list, but hasn't been responded to beyond an acknowledgement on November 24th (the original report didn't make it onto the security list because it was held in a moderation queue).

The same vulnerability was reported against various languages and web frameworks, and is already fixed in some of them.

Their recommended fix is to randomize the hash function.

All the best,

Michael

# CVE-2012-1150

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2012-1149.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2012-1151.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2012-1150 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1150)

#### Description

Python before 2.6.8, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, 3.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.3 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2011-3389

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2011-3388.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2011-3415.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2011-3389 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3389)

#### Description

The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a "BEAST" attack.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This option is currently not yet fixed in openssl itself by default, as it would break some clients and servers. So far every openssl using library or program needs to enable the workaround by itself, by removing the SSL\_OP\_DONT\_INSERT\_EMPTY\_FRAGMENTS from the options passed to the SSL initialization.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [716002](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=716002) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [719047](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=719047) [VERIFIED / WONTFIX], [725167](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725167) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [726096](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=726096) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [739248](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=739248) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [739256](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=739256) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [742306](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=742306) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [751718](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=751718) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [759666](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=759666) [CLOSED / FIXED], [763598](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=763598) [NEW], [814655](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=814655) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# USN-1615-1: Python 3.2 vulnerabilities

23 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 3.2.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [python3.2](/security/cves?package=python3.2) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 3.2)

## Details

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04

and 11.10. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not

properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could

exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption. This issue

did not affect Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2012-2135](/security/CVE-2012-2135))

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

# Python 2.7.3

**Release Date:** April 9, 2012

Note: A newer bugfix release, 2.7.4, is currently [available](/download/releases/2.7.4/). Its use is recommended over previous versions
of 2.7.

Python 2.7.3 was released on April 9, 2012. 2.7.3 includes fixes for several
reported security issues in 2.7.2: [issue 13703](http://bugs.python.org/issue13703) (oCERT-2011-003, hash
collision denial of service), [issue 14234](http://bugs.python.org/issue14234) (CVE-2012-0876, hash table
collisions CPU usage DoS in the expat library), [issue 14001](http://bugs.python.org/issue14001) (CVE-2012-0845,
SimpleXMLRPCServer denial of service), and [issue 13885](http://bugs.python.org/issue13885) (CVE-2011-3389,

  discovery
* A much faster io module
* Automatic numbering of fields in the str.format() method
* Float repr improvements backported from 3.x
* Tile support for Tkinter

They will not work on Intel Itanium Processors (formerly IA-64). |

| [2] | *([1](#id3), [2](#id4))* There is [important information about IDLE, Tkinter, and Tcl/Tk on Mac OS X here](/download/mac/tcltk). Also, on Mac OS X 10.6, if you need to build C extension modules with the 32-bit-only Python installed, you will need Apple Xcode 3, not 4. The 64-bit/32-bit Python can use either Xcode 3 or Xcode 4. |

# Python 3.2.3

**Release Date:** April 10, 2012

**Note:** A newer security-fix release, 3.2.6, is currently [available](/downloads/release/python-326/). Its use is recommended.

Python 3.2.3 was released on April 10, 2012. It includes fixes for several
reported security issues: [issue 13703](http://bugs.python.org/issue13703) (CVE-2012-1150, hash collision denial
of service), [issue 14234](http://bugs.python.org/issue14234) (CVE-2012-0876, Expat hash collision denial of
service), [issue 14001](http://bugs.python.org/issue14001) (CVE-2012-0845, SimpleXMLRPCServer denial of service),
and [issue 13885](http://bugs.python.org/issue13885) (CVE-2011-3389, disabling of the CBC IV attack countermeasure
in the \_ssl module).

Python 3.2 is a continuation of the efforts to improve and stabilize the Python
3.x line. Since the final release of Python 2.7, the 2.x line will only receive
bugfixes, and new features are developed for 3.x only.

Since [PEP 3003](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3003), the Moratorium on Language Changes, is in effect, there are
no changes in Python's syntax and only few changes to built-in types in Python
3.2. Development efforts concentrated on the standard library and support for
porting code to Python 3. Highlights are:

* numerous improvements to the unittest module
* [PEP 3147](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147), support for .pyc repository directories
* [PEP 3149](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3149), support for version tagged dynamic libraries
* [PEP 3148](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3148), a new futures library for concurrent programming
* [PEP 384](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384), a stable ABI for extension modules
* [PEP 391](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0391), dictionary-based logging configuration
* an overhauled GIL implementation that reduces contention
* an extended email package that handles bytes messages
* a much improved ssl module with support for SSL contexts and certificate
  hostname matching
* a sysconfig module to access configuration information
* additions to the shutil module, among them archive file support
* many enhancements to configparser, among them mapping protocol support
* improvements to pdb, the Python debugger
* countless fixes regarding bytes/string issues; among them full support
  for a bytes environment (filenames, environment variables)
* many consistency and behavior fixes for numeric operations

| [[1]](#id1) | The binaries for AMD64 will also work on processors that implement the Intel 64 architecture (formerly EM64T), i.e. the architecture that Microsoft calls x64, and AMD called x86-64 before calling it AMD64. They will not work on Intel Itanium Processors (formerly IA-64). |

| [2] | *([1](#id2), [2](#id3))* There is [important information about IDLE, Tkinter, and Tcl/Tk on Mac OS X here](/download/mac/tcltk). Also, on Mac OS X 10.6, if you need to build C extension modules with the 32-bit-only Python installed, you will need Apple Xcode 3, not 4. The 64-bit/32-bit Python can use either Xcode 3 or Xcode 4. |
