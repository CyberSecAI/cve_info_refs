{
  "CVE-2012-1150": {
    "Description": "Python before 2.6.8, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, 3.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.3 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the predictability of the hash function used by Python for generating hash values for strings and other objects. This predictability allows an attacker to craft specific input that will cause hash collisions, leading to a degradation in dictionary performance from O(1) to O(n).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Predictable hash function",
      "Lack of collision mitigation in hash table implementation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending crafted inputs to a python application that uses dictionaries, consuming excessive CPU resources.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network (HTTP POST requests with large number of parameters)",
       "Local access with crafted input data"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input data to a Python application or otherwise inject colliding keys into a dictionary.",
    "Additional Notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when the Python interpreter processes inputs, such as from HTTP requests. This problem is similar to the one found and fixed in Perl. An attacker can exploit the flaw to make Python use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending a request with many parameters that hash to the same value. The fixes for this issue involve adding the `-R` command line option and setting the `PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable to `random`. This results in an unpredictable value used to salt str and datetime objects. The fixes address not only the DoS issue but also address the security risk when hash values are used in security contexts. Some systems may have the fix implemented by default in their Python versions, while others may require manual configuration to enable the randomization. Some applications may also exhibit issues with a change in the hashing behavior."
