How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    	       	 CVE-2012-1123 CVE-2012-2692

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Mantis, am issue tracking
system.

CVE-2012-1118
	Mantis installation in which the private_bug_view_threshold
	configuration option has been set to an array value do not
	properly enforce bug viewing restrictions.

CVE-2012-1119
	Copy/clone bug report actions fail to leave an audit trail.

CVE-2012-1120
	The delete_bug_threshold/bugnote_allow_user_edit_delete
	access check can be bypassed by users who have write
	access to the SOAP API.

CVE-2012-1122
	Mantis performed access checks incorrectly when moving bugs
	between projects.

CVE-2012-1123
	A SOAP client sending a null password field can authenticate
	as the Mantis administrator.

CVE-2012-2692
	Mantis does not check the delete_attachments_threshold
	permission when a user attempts to delete an attachment from
	an issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.8+dfsg-10squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mantis packages.

| Summary | 0013656: Reporters have read/write access to existing data of other users | | | | |
| Description | I noticed in history that user "a" was able to delete note 10379 in issue [0003932](/bugs/view.php?id=3932 "[new] Reopen operation have to clear \"Fixed in version\" and redefine  Version and Build fields")  One of our managers or administrators should check a) Is the user "a" a reporter? b) Is configured that reporters are allowed to delete notes?  If a) is true and b) is false the problem might be caused by SOAP API.  Is there any reason why we set $g\_mc\_readwrite\_access\_level\_threshold = REPORTER; in file mc\_config\_defaults\_inc.php and not DEVELOPER ?  At first sight it seems that a reporter is able to clean up our tracker by using SOAP. | | | | |

I think that - for the time being - we should raise the threshold on mantisbt.org to DEVELOPER immediately.  I will then review the usage of this setting in the SOAP API and ensure that we do not have any security leaks. |

I have attached patches for the deletion issues. By monday I should have a proper fix for the 'download unauthorized attachments' issue, as it is still an problem.  I think we should cut a 1.2.9 release to fix this next week. And at the same time advise all users how to appy a hotfix by creating a mc\_config\_inc.php in api/soap/ and adding  $g\_mc\_readwrite\_access\_level\_threshold = DEVELOPER;  to it. |

If possible, I think it would be useful to restore deleted bugnotes from backup. If that is not possible or we don't have a backup, maybe Google cache can help.  Regarding ~10379 (deleted note in [0003932](/bugs/view.php?id=3932 "[new] Reopen operation have to clear \"Fixed in version\" and redefine  Version and Build fields")), I have added the contents of the deleted note into a new one. |

The only fixes to apply are those attached to the bug.  I'd like to wait pushing them until we are ready to make a release. I will supply fixes for both master and master-1.2.x . The question is, when can we make that release? |

Firstly, thanks for pushing out some fixes.  This is what has always concerned me about MantisBT -- inconsistent permission checks throughout the code base.  The first random SOAP API call I checked is incorrect: mc\_issue\_get\_id\_from\_summary. It does not take into account whether the issue is private and as a result will always reveal whether or not a private issue with a specified summary exists -- even if the user does not have permission to know about private issues. This is nitpicking because timing analysis of SOAP calls (which we make no attempt to protect against yet) could reveal this information too, so I'm not overly concerned about this one.  The second randomly selected call I checked was also incorrect: mci\_issue\_get\_tags\_for\_bug\_id. This call also fails to check whether the issue is private and whether the user has permission to read the private issue. The access check should be changed to access\_has\_bug\_level instead which correctly handles private issues, project specific permissions, etc.  I don't want to pick on SOAP API because I could open up almost any other file in the MantisBT source tree and find similar problems of inconsistent permission checks. It's really something we need to spend some time sorting out throughout the code base, restructuring to remove these inconsistencies. |

I fully agree with your analysis of the current state of security checks - it's too hard because they are currently duplicated across pages and APIs - the SOAP API simply copies what the regular pages are doing.  This is why I've earlier created bug [0012328](/bugs/view.php?id=12328 "[acknowledged] Normalise access checks between the web interface and the SOAP API"), which aims to extract a higher-level API usable for all 'clients' which need access to information. |
