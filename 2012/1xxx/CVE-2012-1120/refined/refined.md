Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the MantisBT SOAP API. Specifically, users with write access to the SOAP API could bypass the configured `delete_bug_threshold` and `bugnote_allow_user_edit_delete` settings. This means they could delete issues and bugnotes even if they lacked the necessary privileges according to the standard web interface access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Access Control:** The SOAP API did not properly enforce the same access control policies as the web interface.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The API failed to verify if a user had the right permissions before allowing deletion of issues and bugnotes.
*   **Missing Privilege Checks:**  The SOAP API did not utilize the `access_has_bug_level` and  `access_has_bugnote_level` functions for permission checks, which are essential for proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Deletion:** Attackers could delete arbitrary bug reports and bug notes, potentially causing data loss, disruption and manipulation of issue tracking information.
*   **Abuse of SOAP API:** Users with write access, but insufficient delete permissions via the web interface, could use the SOAP API to bypass access restrictions and escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SOAP API:** The primary attack vector is through the MantisBT SOAP API.
*   **Remote Access:** Exploitation can occur remotely through the SOAP API interface (if accessible).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access to SOAP API:** The attacker needs an account with write access to the MantisBT SOAP API. This typically involves having the 'reporter' access level, but this can be adjusted by admin in the config file.
*   **Knowledge of SOAP API:** The attacker would need to know how to use the MantisBT SOAP API to send malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was found in MantisBT versions prior to 1.2.9.
*   A fix was implemented by adding checks for `access_has_bug_level` and  `access_has_bugnote_level` within the `mc_issue_api.php` file, specifically within the `mc_issue_delete` and `bugnote_delete` functions via SOAP API calls.
*   A patch was created to resolve the issue.
*   A hotfix recommendation was to set `$g_mc_readwrite_access_level_threshold = DEVELOPER;` in `mc_config_inc.php` within the `api/soap/` directory.
*   The issue was considered serious as all MantisBT installations were vulnerable to the deletion problem.
* The bug report associated with this CVE is [0013656](http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13656)

**Summary of Changes:**

The fix involves adding the following checks within the `mc_issue_delete` function in `api/soap/mc_issue_api.php`:

```php
if (!access_has_bug_level(config_get('delete_bug_threshold'), $p_issue_id, $t_user_id)) {
    return mci_soap_fault_access_denied($t_user_id);
}
```

And within `bugnote_delete`:

```php
    if ( ( $t_user_id != $t_reporter_id ) || ( OFF == config_get( 'bugnote_allow_user_edit_delete' ) ) ) {
        if ( !access_has_bugnote_level( config_get( 'delete_bugnote_threshold' ), $p_issue_note_id ) ) {
            return mci_soap_fault_access_denied( $t_user_id );
        }
    }
```

This ensures that the SOAP API respects the configured deletion thresholds, which was missing in previous versions.
