- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of script information included in specially crafted HTML by DotNetNuke, which allows bypassing cross-site scripting filtering in the telerik HTML editor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate handling of HTML containing JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Injecting malicious HTML with JavaScript into an HTML module. This requires the attacker to have edit permissions for the module.
    - Sending a specially crafted message to a user via the messaging component, which executes arbitrary script when the user reads the message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For HTML module injection, the attacker needs to have edit permissions for an HTML module.
    - For message-based attacks, the attacker only needs to be able to send a message to a vulnerable user through the messaging component.
