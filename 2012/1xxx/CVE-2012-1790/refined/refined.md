Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `webgrind` application's `index.php` file, specifically within the `fileviewer` case.
*   The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `file` parameter. It directly uses this input to include files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. The application allows an attacker to include local files by manipulating the `file` parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application lacks sufficient checks on the `file` parameter before including files.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability can be exploited using directory traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) within the `file` parameter to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **NULL Byte Injection:** URL encoded NULL bytes can also be used in the file parameter to bypass security checks and manipulate the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of System Information:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive system files, like `/etc/passwd` on Linux-based systems or `boot.ini` on Windows, leading to information disclosure.
*  **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Arbitrary file inclusion could expose other configuration files or source code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:**  The `file` parameter is passed via an HTTP GET request to `index.php`.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts malicious URLs with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) and URL-encoded null bytes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable `webgrind` application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is in `index.php` within the fileviewer case:
    ```php
    122: case 'fileviewer':
    123:     $file = get('file');
    124:     $line = get('line');
    ```
    The `get('file')` function retrieves the value of the `file` parameter and passes it to a file inclusion mechanism without validation.

**Example Attack URLs:**

*   `http://<host>/webgrind/index.php?file=/etc/passwd&op=fileviewer` (Linux)
*   `http://<host>/webgrind/index.php?file=/boot.ini&op=fileviewer` (Windows)

**Additional Notes**
* The advisory from zeroscience.mk and exploit-db confirm that this is indeed a LFI vulnerability
* The Exploit-DB entry provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the use of directory traversal and URL encoded null bytes.
* The vulnerability was discovered on Feb 22, 2012, and publicly disclosed on Feb 25, 2012
