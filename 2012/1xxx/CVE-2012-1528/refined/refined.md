Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1528:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the Windows Briefcase feature. Specifically, it occurs when Windows improperly handles a specially crafted briefcase file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow, which happens when a calculation produces a value that exceeds the maximum value the storage location can handle. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including memory corruption and potential code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. The code runs with the same privileges as the user who opened the crafted briefcase.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system, enabling them to install software, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
*   **Reduced Impact with Limited User Rights:** Users with fewer user rights are less impacted but can still be compromised to the level of their own access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Briefcase:** An attacker creates a malicious briefcase file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to open the crafted briefcase. This is often done via a network share that the user browses to using Windows Explorer or by sending the file as an attachment.
*   **Network Shares:** Attackers might host the malicious briefcase on a network share to lure victims.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious File:** The attacker needs the technical ability to create a specially crafted briefcase file that triggers the integer overflow.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must manipulate the user to access the malicious briefcase file by opening it through Windows Explorer or other methods.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker may need network access to host the malicious briefcase, although an email attachment can also be an attack vector.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in a wide range of Microsoft Windows operating systems, including Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, 7, Server 2008 R2, 8, and Server 2012. Windows RT and Server Core installations are not affected.
*   Microsoft rated the vulnerability as "Critical" for all affected systems, highlighting the severity of the threat.
*   Microsoft has released security updates to address the vulnerability by modifying how Windows handles specially crafted briefcases.
*   Workarounds involve disabling the Briefcase namespace shell extension, however, it removes the briefcase sync feature.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed, but reported to Microsoft through coordinated vulnerability disclosure before the patch was released.
