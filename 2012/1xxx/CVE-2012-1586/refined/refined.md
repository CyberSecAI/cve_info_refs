Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `mount.cifs` utility in `cifs-utils` performing a `chdir()` (change directory) operation to the target mount point before checking the `/etc/fstab` file. This allows a local user to probe the existence of arbitrary files and directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability. `mount.cifs` is installed as setuid, meaning it runs with elevated privileges.  Because the chdir is done before the fstab check, error messages reveal whether a given path exists.
*   **Incorrect Order of Operations:** The core issue lies in the incorrect order of operations within `mount.cifs`. The change directory operation should occur after the necessary checks and validations.
*   **Use of Setuid:** The setuid nature of the `mount.cifs` executable amplifies the impact of the vulnerability, allowing unprivileged users to leverage it for information gathering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File/Directory Enumeration:** A local attacker can use this vulnerability to determine the existence of files or directories on the system. This could be used to gather information about the system's configuration, identify potential targets for further attacks, or confirm whether certain software or files are present.
*   **Limited Impact:** The Debian security tracker notes this as a "Harmless information leak," specifying that if a user can perform arbitrary CIFS mounts, they likely have greater capabilities anyway. This implies the impact is limited to information disclosure and doesn't directly enable privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is purely local. The attacker must have the ability to execute the `mount.cifs` utility.
*   **Manipulating mount.cifs Arguments:** The attacker manipulates the command-line arguments of `mount.cifs`, specifically the mount path, to probe the existence of specific files or directories on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system where `cifs-utils` is installed.
*   **Ability to Execute `mount.cifs`:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `mount.cifs` command, although they do not need root privileges to exploit the vulnerability due to the setuid bit on `mount.cifs`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report in Debian indicates that the initial severity was deemed "grave" but was later downgraded to "important," because the impact was determined to be an information leak.
*   The fix implemented in `cifs-utils` version `2:5.3-2` involved dropping capabilities instead of having `mount.cifs` setuid, to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The Debian bug report provides a detailed timeline of the reporting, discussion, reassignment, and eventual resolution of the vulnerability.
