| **Description** | mount.cifs in cifs-utils 2.6 allows local users to determine the existence of arbitrary files or directories via the file path in the second argument, which reveals their existence in an error message. |

## Vulnerable and fixed packages

The table below lists information on source packages.

| Source Package | Release | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [cifs-utils](/tracker/source-package/cifs-utils) ([PTS](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/cifs-utils)) | bullseye | 2:6.11-3.1+deb11u2 | fixed |
|  | bullseye (security) | 2:6.11-3.1+deb11u1 | fixed |
|  | bookworm | 2:7.0-2 | fixed |
|  | sid, trixie | 2:7.1-1 | fixed |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [cifs-utils](/tracker/source-package/cifs-utils) | source | (unstable) | 2:5.3-2 | unimportant |  | [665923](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=665923) |

## Notes

```
Harmless information leak, if a user can perform arbitrary CIFS mounts they probably
can do a lot more with this

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=665923;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: samba
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hi,
it was discovered that mount.cifs is doing a chdir to the specified directory
before the fstab file is actually checked. Since mount.cifs is (also on
Debian) installed as setuid, this allows an attacker to use the program to
enumerate the existence of files/directories on the system by checking for the
existence of the error response.

I don't have time to write a patch now or to test that, but a quick look at
mount.cifs.c suggests that this can be fixed just by changing the order of the
execution.

Reference <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8821>

Cheers
Nico

How does an information leak about the names of files qualify as a "grave"
bug?  This doesn't seem consistent with
<<http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities>> to me.

Also, mount.cifs doesn't come from the samba source anymore; reassigning to
cifs-utils.

Thanks,

Well it depends on your definition of access to accounts of users. Anyway, I
don't have any deep feelings about this, so no need to discuss this further.

I noticed that right after filing the bug and reassigned it already myself.

Luk, are you in position to take care of this? Even though the bug is
not RC, fixing it would be nice. Also, aren't we late by one version
or something with cifs-utils?

It's not that easy, as that would mean that another security issue gets
reintroduced.

Upstream is looking at it now and very probaby they will just make sure
that the error responses are all the same.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].
