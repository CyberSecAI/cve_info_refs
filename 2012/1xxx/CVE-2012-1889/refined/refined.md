Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-1889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) handles objects in memory. Specifically, it occurs when MSXML attempts to access an object that hasn't been properly initialized. This uninitialized memory can lead to exploitable conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Uninitialized Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is the use of uninitialized memory within the MSXML library. This can lead to various security issues.
-   **Remote Code Execution:** Due to the memory corruption, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute code of their choice on the victim's system.
-   **Full System Control:** With remote code execution, an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
-   **Malicious Activities:** This control could enable an attacker to:
    -   Install programs
    -   View, change, or delete data
    -   Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Web-based attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer.
-   **Compromised websites:** Malicious actors can inject exploits into compromised websites, including those that host user-provided content or advertisements.
-   **Office documents:** The vulnerability can be exploited via specially crafted content within Office documents

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need any special credentials or prior access to the victim's system.
-   **User interaction:** The attacker has to lure a user into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious Office document. This often involves social engineering tactics, such as tricking users into clicking links in emails or instant messages.
-   **Exploit creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a web page or document with malicious content that will trigger the uninitialized memory vulnerability in MSXML.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects various versions of MSXML (3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0), Windows, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Expression Web, and other Microsoft server software.
- Microsoft has released updates (KB2719985, KB2721691, KB2721693, KB2687627, KB2596856, KB2687497) to address this vulnerability
- Workarounds such as disabling Active Scripting in Internet Explorer or applying "Fix it" solutions can reduce the risk of exploitation.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is mentioned as a tool that can help mitigate the exploitation of this vulnerability by adding additional protection layers.

This content provides significantly more details than a typical CVE description, including mitigating factors, workarounds, and specific software affected. It also notes that limited, targeted attacks exploiting the vulnerability are already occurring and that reliable public exploit code is available, making it a significant security risk.
