- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because DotNetNuke versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.2 do not properly validate script information included within a specially crafted URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into a modal popup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted URL that, when clicked by a victim, injects malicious JavaScript into a modal popup within the DotNetNuke application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and convince a victim to click on it.
