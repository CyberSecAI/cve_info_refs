Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper authentication and access control within the AutoFORM PDM Archive software. Non-administrative users can access and execute administrative functions that should be restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Non-administrative users can directly invoke administrative functions, specifically the password-change function for the default administrator account.
- **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The application fails to properly authenticate and authorize users before allowing access to administrative functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can change the administrator password without knowing the original password.
- This leads to the attacker gaining full administrative privileges on the AutoFORM PDM Archive system.
- The attacker can then potentially access sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via direct calls to administrative functions, which are normally hidden from non-administrative users.
- Specifically, a non-administrative user can call the password-change function directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid, non-administrative user account on the AutoFORM PDM Archive system.
- The attacker must be able to make direct calls to the web service (SOAP requests).
