Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## Introduction

The Cisco Unified Computing System is a next-generation data center platform that unites compute, network, storage access, and virtualization into a cohesive system designed to reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) and increase business agility. The system integrates a low-latency, lossless 10-Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric with enterprise-class, x86-architecture servers. The system is an integrated, scalable, multi-chassis platform in which all resources participate in a unified management domain.

## System Requirements

Cisco UCS Manager must meet or exceed the following minimum system requirements:

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)

---

**Caution**
![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The Cisco UCS Manager GUI is a Java-based application, and is only supported on Sun JRE 1.6.

---

* UCS Manager uses web start and supports the following web browsers:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Mozilla Firefox 3.0 or higher

Adobe Flash Player 10 or higher is required for some features

* UCS Manager is supported on the following operating systems:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Windows XP

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Windows Vista

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 or higher

## Updating Cisco UCS Versions

To update the Cisco UCS software and firmware, see the appropriate  [Upgrading Cisco UCS](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10281/prod_installation_guides_list.html)  document for your installation. All A, B, and C bundles must be at the exact same version and patch level.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/tip.gif)

---

**Tip**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The upgrade process from 1.4(1) to 1.4(2) or 1.4(3) or 1.4(4) is identical to upgrading from 1.3 versions to 1.4 versions.

---

Use the  **scope firmware** and  **show package**  *filename*  **expand** CLI commands to view the contents of a given release package. Filenames are accurate for the initial patch release in each table. Expect small changes for subsequent patch releases.

## Hardware and Software Interoperability

* [“Internal Dependencies” section](/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/release/notes/OL_24086.html#61728)
* [“Capability Catalog” section](/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/release/notes/OL_24086.html#18569)

For detailed information about storage switch, operating system, adapter, adapter utility, and storage array interoperability, see the  *Hardware and Software Interoperability Matrix* for this release*,*  located at:

 <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/unified-computing-system/products-technical-reference-list.html>

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) VMware ESX and ESXi 3.5 Update 4, and ESX and ESXi 4.0 are not compatible with Intel 56xx processors. 55xx processors are not affected by this limitation. See the interoperability matrix for this release for OS and other support questions.

---

### Internal Dependencies

 [Table 6](/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/release/notes/OL_24086.html#50743)  shows interdependencies between UCS hardware and versions of Cisco UCS Manager. Server FRU items like DIMMs are dependent on their server type, and chassis items like fans and power supplies work with all versions of UCS Manager.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)

---

**Caution**
![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You cannot mix component software versions (for example, you cannot have a B200 using the 1.0(1) BIOS with a UCS M81KR adapter running 1.0(2) firmware managed by UCS Manager 1.3(1)). Compare the minimum software version for all your components and use at least the latest of all the versions, or use the most current version of software for all components. Mixing M1 and M2 hardware versions is not an issue if they are running software at a version matching the other system components.

### Capability Catalog

Cisco UCS Manager uses the catalog to update the display and configurability of server components such as newly qualified DIMMs and disk drives. The UCS Manager Capability Catalog is a single image, but it is also embedded in UCS Manager. The latest posted 1. *x* catalog will work with any posted 1.3 or 1.4 release.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco UCS Manager 1.*x* releases will work with any 1.*x* catalog file, but not with any 2.0 or later catalog versions. Release 1.4 is only compatible with a 1.0 catalog file.

---

If a server component is not dependent on a specific BIOS version, using it and having it recognized by UCS Manager is primarily a function of the catalog version. The catalog is released as single image in some cases for convenience purposes in addition to being bundled with UCS infrastructure releases. See  [Table 7](/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/release/notes/OL_24086.html#24124)  for details.

## Known Limitations and Behaviors

### The following known limitations found in Release 1.4(*x*) are not otherwise documented:

* Unable to vMotion after blade firmware upgrade from 1.4(3m) to any later release due to AES-NI bit difference. Reboot the server, and disable OEM AESNI Control in BIOS. After you boot to ESXi, vMotion will proceed between the two hosts without any issues.
* Prior to Release 1.4(1) all backplane ports show up in UCS Manager regardless of blade connectivity status. In Release 1.4(1) and later, backplane ports are only created when UCS Manager detects an adapter in the connected blade server. Connected blade servers without an adapter will not create any backplane ports. This issue only applies to blade servers.
* In Release 1.4(1), fabric interconnects introduced support for FC direct topologies, though local zoning is not configurable in the UCS software and is inherited from upstream Cisco MDS or Nexus 5000 switches. For SAN environments with no FC zoning, expect scaling and security issues not seen in an environment with zoning configured. This issue is not UCS specific behavior but common to any default zoned environment. Default zoned configurations are not recommended for production deployments, which should always use direct connect FC topologies with upstream Cisco MDS or Nexus 5000 switches. If no SAN network presently exists upstream, a pair of redundant Cisco MDS 9124 or 9148 switches that are not in the data path will be able to provide zoning configuration. If redundancy is not critical, a single SAN switch is sufficient to provide zoning, however, you will not be able to make zone configuration changes when the SAN switch incurs a failure. Alternately, FCoE licenses on an existing pair of upstream Cisco Nexus 5000 switches would be sufficient to configure zoning.
* In Release 1.4(1i) and later releases, when the monitored DIMM Correctable ECC error rate exceeds the threshold for a given time interval, memory DIMM operability is marked as “Degraded” and minor faults are seen even though the overall status is marked “Operable.” Once marked as “Degraded,” DIMM operability will not get reevaluated unless the DIMM is replaced, even if a BMC or host CPU reset occurs, and DIMM operability will not change. Affected DIMMs will continue to be operational (when Operability status is marked as “Operable”) so correcting the marking is optional. You can force DIMM operability to be reevaluated with the “reset memory error” action in the GUI DIMM window or with the following CLI command sequence:  **scope server x/y**  ->  **scope memory-array <x>** ->  **scope dimm <y>** ->  **reset-errors** ->  **commit-buffer**.
* The VLAN virtual port limit in Release 1.4(1) is 6000 or 14000 in 1.4(3q) if you do not turn on port security and use private VLANs. When this system-wide limit is reached, if you try to add more VLANs through service profiles, the service profile association will fail. In a Layer 2 topology, logical instances of a VLAN are created on each interface for each active VLAN. These instances are referred to as spanning-tree active logical ports or virtual ports. For example, if you define 900 VLANs and 2 uplinks, this configuration would consume 1800 of these virtual VLAN ports.
* When you configure a SPAN, you create a named monitoring session, specify a destination port, and specify one or more sources to monitor. In the GUI, this configuration is all done in one place. In the CLI, you create the session and enter its configuration mode. There, you can only specify the destination session. Next, you have to navigate to the scope of the desired source interface, and tell that interface that it is a source for the particular monitoring session. This behavior is correct according to the way the system is designed.
* Adding a VSAN or VLAN as a SPAN source could fail if another VLAN or VSAN is already a source for a SPAN. When UCS Manager creates a VSAN, it associates an FCoE VLAN to it. Only one UCS Manager-created VSAN and its FCoE VLAN, can be put into a monitor session (SPAN).If both are set as a SPAN source, one monitor session will fail with a fault message. To avoid this, remove either the VSAN or the VLAN as a SPAN source.
* If you are unable to install ESXi 4. *x* on systems with Generation 2 Intel M61KR-I, Emulex M72KR-E, Broadcom M51KR-B or Qlogic M72KR-Q CNA Adapters, be advised that ESXi 4.0 U1, U2, or ESXi 4.1 does not have the updated drivers needed for the Generation 2 CNA from Intel M61KR-I, Emulex M72KR-E, Broadcom M51KR-B, or Qlogic M72KR-Q so it will fail installation before trying to select an installation disk. The reason is that ESXi needs to load a network driver in order to install properly. The only CNA that is currently supported in ESXi versions prior to ESXi 4.0 U1, U2, and ESXi 4.1 is the Cisco M81KR.
* In a RHEL 5.5 installation (either new or an update to UCS 1.4(1)) using the default 1.4.0.98 fnic driver, a command issued to reset a LUN or rescan the LUNs of a SCSI host causes the OS to freeze. If you are using this driver, upgrade to the 1.4.0.145 release of the fnic driver that is available as an RPM or as a driver update disk (DUD). The former can be used to replace the in-box driver with the 1.4.0.145 fnic driver after RHEL 5.5 installation, and the latter can be used to replace the in-box driver with the 1.4.0.145 fnic driver during installation itself. The 1.4.0.145 fnic driver is also available in UCS Release 1.4(1), in the ucs-b2xx-drivers-1.4.1.iso image file. See the README accompanying the fnic rpm and DUD for specific instructions on how to use either. This bug was tracked with RedHat as bugzilla bug number 578328

( <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=578328>).

* The LSI 1064E RAID controller in the B200 and B250 runs at 1.5-GB link speed instead of 3-GB with all 6-GB disks using UCS 1.4 and earlier releases.
* If a RAID cluster is migrated, if during the reassociation process the service profile is shown as “Any Configuration” instead of a specific RAID level, the RAID LUN will remain in an “Inactive” state, and will not boot. To avoid this issue, reassociate the server using exactly the same Policy setting instead of “Any Configuration”.
* We recommend that you follow the industry standard practice of using drives of the same capacity when creating RAID volumes. If drives of different capacities are used, the usable portion of the smallest drive will be used on all drives that make up the RAID volume.
* When installing ESXi 4.0 U2 or 4.1 to a local SSD on a B230, do not use the standard install package. There are driver compatibility issues that require installing a customized ISO image. The image is available by going to  <http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/datacenter_downloads/vmware_vsphere_hypervisor_esxi/4_0#drivers_tools> and then selecting  **OEM Customized Installer CDs** and the Custom Cisco ISO for the ESXi version you wish to install.
* After upgrading from a 1.3(1) to a 1.4( *x*) or a later release, you might see the service profile configuration disappears from an organization. To confirm that this problem has occurred, use a CLI command that begins with show service-profile. A NULL CLI output confirms the problem. This problem is most likely to occur if you created an organization with a space in its name while running a Cisco UCS Manager 1.0 release and then later upgraded Cisco UCS Manager to a 1.3(1) release. In the 1.3(1) release, spaces are not allowed in organization names and are automatically replaced with an underscore. If the system is subsequently upgraded to a 1.4( *x*) or later release, the old organization name with a space reappears without the space to underscore conversion and all of its children (which includes service profiles, policies, and templates) are deleted. Note: An organization that was created in a Cisco UCS 1.3(1) release or with a name that does not contain a space character will not have this problem.

To avoid this problem, do the following before upgrading from a 1.3(1) release to a 1.4( *x*) or a later release:

 1. Change the description field of the organizations that have underscores in their names, by removing the underscores and any spaces to help keep the orgs in the database.

 2. Create a backup using the All Configuration option before upgrading. If a problem occurs after the upgrade, restore the configuration using the backup file. After importing the configuration file, reacknowledge all blades to restore their VIF status.

* When you are upgrading an Emulex adapter while you have a Cisco UCS Manager Release 1.4(4h) or an earlier release installed, the firmware upgrade fails. The failure is not dependent on the version of the Emulex adapter itself.

When performing an Emulex adapter upgrade while you are on Release 1.4, upgrade the Cisco UCS Manager firmware to at least 1.4(4i) release before upgrading the Emulex adapter. When performing a downgrade from a release higher than Release 1.4(4i) to a release lower than Release 1.4(4i), perform the Emulex downgrade first prior to performing the Cisco UCS Manager downgrade

### The following known limitations found in Release 1.3(1) are not otherwise documented:

* With the B-250 blade server, the displayed ESX and Linux OS HDD Boot Device Order is the reverse of the BIOS HDD Boot Order. To rectify this issue, review both the disks (and drive labels as applicable), during installations of ESX and Linux versions and choose the correct disk for installation.
* Only ports 1/1 through 1/8 on the UCS 6120 Fabric Interconnect and 1/1 to 1/16 on the UCS 6140 Fabric Interconnect can be configured to use 1-GB transceivers (GLC-T, GLC-SX-MM, and GLC-LH-SM). Auto-negotiation is not supported for this change; you will need to set the speed manually in UCS Manager. All member ports of a port channel must use these ports running at the same speed, so if you need to have one member port using a 1-GB port, all other members will have to change as well.
* Even with the Protect Configuration Flag set to Enabled, user data may not be protected during a UCS upgrade from release 1.2(1) or earlier builds to release 1.3(1i) for unassociated servers, the first time the servers get associated under 1.3(1i), the ProtectConfig Property (even if ProtectConfig=YES) will not protect the user data as the association will proceed without the configuration errors. Note that the subsequent associations would be blocked if the ProtectConfig = YES and the Local Disk Configuration Policy mismatches. Associated servers will not reboot and no configuration errors will be reported.
* The Protect Configuration Flag was introduced in 1.3(1c) and so after the upgrade, this flag is Enabled in the Local Disk Policy as the default. If there is no mismatch between the Local Disk Policy of the previous SP to the incoming SP, the association should go through. Make sure that there is no mismatch; otherwise, a configuration error will be reported and association will fail.

To manually disable the Protect Config Flag (only do this if you do not care about the data in the disk) to prevent the configuration errors and allow the service profile association to go through, follow these steps:

 **a.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Select the service profile that you will be using to associate to the Server.

 **b.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Select the Storage Tab on the right hand side pane of the service profile.

 **c.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Select Change Local Disk Configuration Policy under the Storage Tab.

 **d.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable or Enable the Protect Configuration Flag (property) as desired and save the settings.

* The Disk Fault/Error Codes, Disk Status, Alarms, and the failures forwarded by the SAS Controller are not received by Cisco UCS Manager.
* Before you delete a VLAN from a fabric interconnect, ensure that the VLAN has been removed from all vNICs and vNIC templates. If you delete a VLAN that is assigned to a vNIC or vNIC template, the vNIC could allow that VLAN to flap.

## Resolved Caveats

### The following caveats are resolved in 1.4(4l) release:

* A memory leak in the bmcd and thermal processes no longer causes the IOM to reboot due to lack of memory. (CSCtz27298)
* Transient faults related to UCS Manager chassis SEEPROM usage and power capping no longer occur. (CSCue49366)
* IOM process bmcd no longer fails to discover blades after reboot. (CSCuf34701)
* IOMs no longer crash due to a memory leak in the baseboard management controller (BMC). (CSCuf61116)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.4(4k) release:

* The snmpd and ldapd processes no longer crash and restart when new bundle images are activated during the UCS Manager upgrade process. (CSCty33146)
* FIs no longer crash after ports are changed from fabric port to SPAN destination port and the SPAN configuration is removed. (CSCuc11474)
* Polling of SNMP objects no longer causes an eth\_port\_sec process crash. (CSCub36000)
* The following critical fault, '[FSM:FAILED]: communication service configuration (FSM:sam:dme:CommSvcEpUpdateSvcEp)' is no longer seen after disabling SNMP, or after restoring the SAM configuration when SNMP is disabled. (CSCuc53591)
* The IOM upgrade no longer fails and gets into a continuous reboot after the IOM is activated by the fabric interconnect. (CSCuc15009)
* You will no longer see random errors such as thermal-problem, performance-problem, and equipment-degraded false alarm. (CSCua96703)
* When polling ipAdEntIfIndex, you will no longer see the following error:.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.20.1.2 = No Such Instance currently exists at this OID to the MDS boxes. (CSCub84958)
* Cisco UCS Manager is no longer truncating the last digit of the license file id from the license. (CSCuc32555)
* SNMP no longer fails to return the management IP address. (CSCub90031)
* When downgrading to Release 1.4.4, the license count displayed and available is no longer greater than the licenses you have obtained. (CSCuc82895)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.0(63).T catalog:

* The Cisco UCS B230 M2 and B440 M2 servers now recognize the UCS-MR-2X164RX-D DIMMs. (CSCua71178) (CSCuc32844)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.4(4j) release:

* Fan module amber LED blinking and/or fans running at high speeds for no apparent reason will no longer be seen. (CSCtx49686, CSCtx52556)
* IOM with memory parity issue will no longer unexpectedly crash/hang. IOM will automatically reboot and recover without any intervention. (CSCtz15594)
* User with server-profile role and one assigned Locale can reset/shutdown/boot the server from KVM window. (CSCua54788)
* Cisco UCS Manager will show correct PSU slots for C200 Cisco UCS rack-Mount Server. (CSCua38633)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.4(4i) release:

* Upon server reboot, the FCoE interfaces on Cisco UCS N20-AE0002 will always be operationally up. (CSCua37003)
* Cisco UCS 1.4(4i) release contains a fix for the adapter firmware upgrade. When you are upgrading an Emulex adapter while you have a Cisco UCS Manager Release 1.4(4h) or an earlier release installed, the firmware upgrade fails. The failure is not dependent on the version of the Emulex adapter itself.

When performing an Emulex adapter upgrade while you are on Release 1.4, upgrade the Cisco UCS Manager firmware to at least 1.4(4i) release before upgrading the Emulex adapter. When performing a downgrade from a release higher than Release 1.4(4i) to a release lower than Release 1.4(4i), perform the Emulex downgrade first prior to performing the Cisco UCS Manager downgrade. (CSCtq36461)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.4(4g) release:

* The Cisco B200 M2 Blade discovery will no longer get stuck in a throttled state in a scaled setup. (CSCtx49569)
* The read-only users can no longer create any log files at the /var/home/ directory and the operation performed by the read-only users will no longer fill the "/" partition using the CLI show command. As a result, there will no longer be any remote authentication failure on the Cisco UCS Manager. (CSCua07619)
* The Fibre Channel firmware issue will no longer disrupt the SAN connectivity for the server. (CSCtz87024)
* Phase 3.0 Emulex Tigershark firmware is added to the UCS 1.4.4 release. (CSCua26726)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.4(4f) release:

BIOS

* When interrupt remapping is enabled in the BIOS, the virtual Host Bus Adapters (vHBAs) and the other PCI devices respond in ESX/ESXi 4.1. (CSCth36989)
* While upgrading from the 2.0(1q) to 2.0(1s) release and from the 1.4.3 to 1.4.4 release, the host performance will no longer be affected after activating the subordinate Fabric Interconnect. (CSCtw97157)
* The interrupt remapping issue on VMware ESX is now fixed. (CSCty98534)

Cisco UCS Manager

* Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect now reboots properly and no configuration files are missing. (CSCto51594)
* The CIMC activate process no longer gets stuck in the "activating" state. (CSCty56181)
* While attempting to upgrade the B230 M1/M2 CIMC firmware, the blade discovery no longer fails. (CSCtt08673)
* The HTTP version is upgraded to 2.2.21 and the OpenSSL library version is upgraded to 0.9.8q. (CSCtw88264)
* Creating a local user account will no longer fail when the password is set. (CSCtx53713)
* Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect devices no longer restart after receiving a malformed SNMP request. (CSCts32452) (CSCts32463)
* The I2C communication issues are fixed now and the ASIC port failure message will no longer be seen. (CSCtr18730)
* FET detection algorithm version 3 is now supported in the 1.4(4f) release. (CSCty83695)
* The board temperature sensors TEMP\_SENS\_FRONT and TEMP\_SENS\_REAR are now moved to the Minor faults category in the Cisco UCS Manager. (CSCtj26813)
* Any actions on the service profile that involve a change, no longer trigger a reboot on the server. (CSCty10870)
* When a service profile is in the config-failed state and some of the previously allocated VLANs are deleted, the deleted VLANs now get counted in the access port VLAN count. When a service profile comes out of the config-failed state upon reducing the border port VLANs, the access VLAN port count is consistent with the actual number of the access port VLANs. (CSCty37323)
* The DME process on one Fabric Interconnect no longer crashes after a peer Fabric Interconnect is in an inoperable state. (CSCty90643)
* The PNUOS image now gets updated during the Cisco UCS build upgrade process as expected and the HDD/SSD operability is now reported correctly. (CSCtq45199)
* The permissions on the /dev/null directory on a primary Fabric Interconnect are now corrected, and the Fabric Interconnect can now join as a secondary device. (CSCto94998)
* When the Cisco UCS Manager is upgraded from 1.3( *x*) release to either 1.4( *x*) or 2. *x* release before upgrading the Fabric Interconnects, an internal process no longer crashes and both the Fabric Interconnects receive the Cisco NX-OS firmware. (CSCty19988)
* The Cisco UCS Manager cluster election process is now improved in case of the chassis and the Fabric Interconnect failure. Primary election now happens automatically after a power failure. (CSCtx66751)

Fabric Interconnect

* Fabric B connected to the Cisco Nexus 5000 series platforms no longer fails in the NPIV process during a stable state. (CSCts53457)
* An internal process no longer crashes on a Fabric Interconnect running the Cisco UCS Manager 1.4.3l release and the Fabric Interconnect does not reboot unexpectedly. (CSCtx41463)
* The Ethernet Port Channel service on the Cisco UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnect no longer crashes when the system is in a steady state. (CSCtx79272)
* The Fibre Channel span port now works for the Port Analyzer Adapter (PAA) on the 8-GB expansion module with the Cisco UCS Manager 1.4.3 release. (CSCty05262)

Security

* Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect devices no longer write sensitive SSL key material to the system log when a new CSR request is generated. (CSCtq86508)
* An internal service account can no longer authenticate to the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect from an isolated internal network. (CSCtq86534)
* While attempting to access the system using the vKVM, the “Login Failed” message is no longer seen. (CSCtq94963)
* With the ls-config-policy or the ls-server-policy privileges, you can now add or modify the contents of a firmware package. (CSCty43432)
* The Apache Web Server ETag HTTP response header will no longer display the static file attributes. (CSCty45689)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.4(3y) release:

* A denial of service vulnerability was found in the way the multiple overlapping ranges are handled by the Apache HTTPD server as described in  <http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110830-apache>. The vulnerability has been resolved. (CSCts33291)
* When activating a blade controller image, only images appropriate for that blade are presented. (CSCtw73436)
* A board controller firmware upgrade of a B230-M1 or B230-M2 blade no longer gets stuck when updating it after a system upgrade. (CSCtx96515)

### The following caveats are resolved in the 1.4(3u) release:

* When a third party Converged Network Adapter which does not support IO Virtualization (or VNTag) is used but experiences a failure, instead of bringing down the IOM backplane interface the uplink port it is pinned to, the user is allowed to control the behavior and the configuration in the network control policy is honored. This will occur even when the network control policy has the uplink failure action set to bring the link down. Note that the default uplink failure action is to bring the IOM backplane/host facing port down.

## Open Caveats

Caveats opened in earlier builds of a release are still open unless noted otherwise in the bug record.

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(4l):

Symptom ‘Application Blocked by Security Settings’ error when starting the Cisco UCS Manager GUI or KVM Console application. (CSCuo78883)

Because the Java Code Signing Certificate expired, users on Java 7 update 40 or higher might see the following message:

Application Blocked by Security Settings

Your security settings have blocked an application signed with an expired or not-yet-valid certificate from running.

Workaround To fix this issue, you can either temporarily lower your Java security settings to add Cisco UCS Manager as an exception, or if you are using Java 7 update 51 or higher, you can add the Cisco UCS Manager host IP address to the Exception Site list.

To temporarily lower your security settings:

 **1.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Start your Java Control Panel. The location may vary depending on your operating system and browser preferences.

 **2.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Lower the Security level to Medium.

 **3.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Start Cisco UCS Manager.

 **4.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) At the warning message, check the “I accept the risk and want to run this application'” checkbox and click  **Run**.

 **5.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Return to the Java Control Panel and reset your security level.

To add the IP address to the exception site list (for Java 7 version 51 and higher):

 **1.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Start your Java Control Panel. The location may vary depending on your operating system and browser preferences.

 **2.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) In the Security area, click the Edit Site button to add the IP address to the list.

If you use HTTPS to access Cisco UCS Manager, ensure that you have the correct prefix.

 **3.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Click  **OK**.

Symptom When the Fibre Channel Forwarder (FCF) MAC is learned dynamically, it is treated as a MAC move. SAN traffic stops working and the FI loses the data path. This affects devices configured in either NPV or FCoE (FCoE Forwarder). (CSCug14669)

Workaround Do the following:

* Remove the device source that injects the duplicate MAC address into the L2 infrastructure.
* Flap the FC/FCoE link that initially owned this MAC address.

Symptom The FIs reset with the following error message, usually after 780 days of uptime:

%SYSMGR-2-SERVICE\_CRASHED: Service "monitor" (PID XXXX) hasn't

caught signal 6 (core will be saved).

%KERN-0-SYSTEM\_MSG: writing reset reason 16, monitor hap reset -

kernel

Workaround Do the following:

* Configure a SPAN and do not enable it for Ethernet SPAN session.
* Reset the FI during a maintenance window after around 770 days of uptime. (CSCug20103)

Symptom Adding VLAN to VNIC triggers reboot notification. (CSCue52164)

Workaround Upgrade UCS Manager to release 2.1.1a.

Symptom If you have Java 1.6, update 45 installed, when you launch KVM console from Cisco UCS Manager, you will get the following error:

"Cannot run program "C:\\Program": CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified"

Workaround Do one of the following:

* Downgrade Java to 1.6 Update 43 or lower. If you cannot downgrade Java, you can access the KVM from the KVM Manager.
* Uninstall Java, and reinstall in a different location with no spaces in the path. For example, "C:\Java\jre6".
* Launch KVM through http://<UCSM-IP>/ucsm/kvm.jnlp, which prompts for the username/password and the server’s KVM IP. (CSCug40752)

Symptom Cisco UCS Manager displays sporadic  `error accessing shared-storage`  errors. Transient Call Home fan alerts or IOM boot-up errors might also be seen. (CSCui41165)

Workaround There is no known workaround for this issue.

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(4k):

Symptom If you have installed unsupported DIMMs in the blade server, and upgrade to a new catalog version that supports those DIMMs, not all of the DIMM information is displayed when the DIMMs are discovered. (CSCuj63448)

Workaround This is a cosmetic issue. You can reacknowledge the blade server to fix the issue, but that is disruptive.

Symptom On some Cisco UCS B200 M2 blades running bare metal Windows 2008 R2 SP1, the Onboard Failure Logging (OBFL) fills up with OS IPMI information related to the the Windows Power Meter. (CSCud51076)

Workaround There is no known workaround for this issue.

Symptom An SNMP trap with a blank cucsFaultDescription is being sent for FAN fault. (CSCud65983)

Workaround Confirm the FAN status with Cisco UCS Manager.

Symptom The Cisco UCS P81E VIC VMware driver 2.1.2.38 cannot be installed. Upgrading via VUM displays an error stating that the package is invalid. Installing the driver manually using the CLI displays an error stating that the driver is not signed. (CSCud64349)

Workaround There is no known workaround for this issue.

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(4j):

Symptom In some cases, after upgrading and activating Cisco UCS Manager, SNMP crash reboots both FIs. (CSCub34939)

Workaround There is no known workaround for this issue.

### The following bugs were found in the 1.0(57).T catalog:

Symptom The Cisco UCS B230 M2 and B440 M2 servers fail to recognize the UCS-MR-2X164RX-D DIMMs.

Workaround Upgrade to the 1.0(63).T catalog (ucs-catalog.1.0.63.T.bin). (CSCua71178) (CSCuc32844)

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(4f):

Symptom On the Cisco UCS B230 and B440 systems, the temperature sensors for the memory buffer return a false value that is higher than the upper non-recoverable value. The system event logs are generated for the temperature sensors. (CSCty85611)

Workaround This issue is likely to occur when the system runs a memory intensive application, for example, a memory stress test. This is not a hardware issue. The system event logs that are generated for the temperature sensors can be safely ignored.

Symptom The Java download link on the GUI login page currently directs the user to a latest version of Java for download. In Cisco UCS Manager 1.4, only Java version 1.6 is supported. (CSCtz78507)

Workaround Download the correct version of Java 1.6 from Oracle Website.

Symptom When running the Cisco UCS Manager from a Cisco UCS 2.0 release and running the system image from a Cisco UCS pre-2.0 release, there may be an additional delay of approximately 2-4 minutes before the Cisco UCS Manager system starts to process the configuration. This issue happens because of a known issue in one of the Cisco UCS Manager application gateways. (CSCtz56680)

Workaround There is no known workaround for this issue. Apart from the delay, there is no functional impact on the Cisco UCS Manager.

Symptom After upgrading the CIMC/board controller firmware images using the host firmware package and the management firmware package, the blades reboot on performing a configuration change on the service profile. (CSCty83359)

Workaround If the current CIMC firmware version is between 1.4.0 and 1.4.3s or 2.0 and 2.0.1t, first upgrade the CIMC firmware to a version that supports the board controller firmware upgrade. Once the CIMC firmware is upgraded, upgrade the board controller. Note that performing this action will reboot the blade.

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(3m):

Symptom If a hot spare is added in a B200 or B250 server by replacing the bad disk in the RAID array, the Auto Rebuild will fail.

Workaround The rebuild must be started manually. (CSCtr66115)

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(3i):

Symptom A failure has been observed where a MOSFET power transistor failed in a manner that caused it to overheat and emit a flash before failing. There is no indication of a systemic issue with the MOSFET components, and the observed failure in the field is considered to be a random component failure.

Workaround UCS B440 users are strongly encouraged to install UCS Blade Management Controller software version 1.3(1w) or 1.4(3L) in order to mitigate potential for overheating. The software can be downloaded from Cisco.com. See FN-63430 for more information. (CSCtr05373)

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(2b):

UCS Manager

Symptom Failed discovery of blade servers, disassociation of service profiles and I/O module link failure faults which could be caused by a message queue getting filled and not getting drained.

Workaround Upgrade software to release1.4(3i) (CSCtq03411. See the  [software deferral notice](http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/advisory.html?mdfid=283612660&relind=DEFERRED&flowid=22121&fdesc=&reltype=deferred&imageGuId=5A8F274BF7D3A0B5A5094A12B6AAB15C53507505).)

Symptom Associated or discovered rack servers do not come up after downgrading only UCS Manager from 1.4 release to lower releases, then returning to 1.4 from lower releases.

Workaround Always decommission rack servers and fabric extender before downgrading to releases lower than 1.4. Alternately, do not downgrade UCS Manager alone, instead downgrade all the three images (kernel, system and UCS Manager). On upgrade again upgrade all three images. Both downgrade and upgrade will reboot the fabric interconnect. After coming back to 1.4, unconfigure then reconfigure the switch ports connected to rack servers. If you forgot to decommission the rack servers and fabric extender before downgrade and downgraded only the UCS Manager, then after upgrading back to the 1.4 release reboot the switch and unconfigure then reconfigure the switch ports connected to rack unit adapters. (CSCtn84605)

Symptom Nexus 2248 Fabric Extenders show up as a chassis after a downgrade from a 1.4 release. Fabric Extenders are only supported from release 1.4 onwards. If you must downgrade from 1.4 to a previous release, the fabric extender should be decommissioned while in the supported 1.4 release. If the extender (which shows up as a chassis) is decommissioned in the pre 1.4 release, it will not be discovered upon re-upgrading back to 1.4.

Workaround If downgrading to pre-1.4 releases, then decommission the fabric extender prior to downgrade. If the downgrade was done without decommissioning the fabric extender, then do not decommission the fabric extender in the downgraded release. Instead upgrade back to 1.4 and decommission in 1.4. (CSCtl91937)

BIOS

Symptom If the installed DIMMs do not have thermal sensors (the most likely cause as this warning is logged during initial system memory initialization) or the installed DIMMs exceeded the thermal threshold values programmed in either the memory controller or the Memory buffer, then the RankMargintest file in the BMC shows the following warning code:

MRC - Warning Code:0x9 on Socket#1 Br#0 Ch#00, Ddr#00, Dimm#00, Rank#FF (if applicable)

MRC - Warning Code:0x9 on Socket#1 Br#0 Ch#00, Ddr#01, Dimm#00, Rank#FF (if applicable)

Workaround None. The message is informational, and can be ignored. (CSCtn09020)

### The following bug was found in Release 1.4(1j):

Symptom If the UCS system is running UCS Manager firmware prior to release 1.4.1 and a new firmware bundle for Release 1.4.(1i) or (1.4.1j) for B or C series are downloaded then a total of four BIOS files will go missing. This issue is caused by internal BIOS image format change in the 1.4.1 release which was not previously known.

The 4 files will show as deleted under the  **Equipment**  ->  **Firmware Management** ->  **Packages** screen. The files which will show as deleted in B-series are ucs-b230-m1-bios.B230M1.1.4.1c.0.120820101441.bin and ucs-b440-m1-bios.B440M1.1.4.1b.0.120820101442.bin
 The files which will show as deleted in C-series are: ucs-c200-bios.C200.1.2.2f.0.112720102041.bin and ucs-c250-bios.C250.1.2.2f.0.112820100448.bin

Workaround Remove the downloaded C and B-Series firmware bundle and repeat the download when the new 1.4.1 UCS Manager code is activated. (CSCtl48689)

### The following bugs were found in Release 1.4(1i):

Upgrade

Symptom Under certain conditions, the VIC adapter fails after upgrade due to FRU corruption.

Workaround Contact Cisco customer support.

Symptom If the UCS system domain name is invalid, you will not be able to log in to the GUI after the upgrade. A blank name is allowed. Prior to UCS Manager 1.4(1i) invalid characters were allowed in the UCS system domain name. Allowable characters are upper and lower case a through z, numbers 0 through 9, and hyphens except as the first character of the name. A period is allowed for the extension (such as.com) but no other punctuation or spaces are allowed.

Workaround Using the UCS Manager GUI or CLI (use the **set domain** command), set a valid UCS system domain name before upgrading to this release. (CSCtl22245)

Symptom When trying to log into the GUI you experience a java error: “Login Error: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out”. This may happen after upgrade to version 1.4(1i) from version 1.2(1) or earlier. After activating the UCS Manger Software you lose the ability to log into the UCS Manager GUI.

Workaround Upgrade to version 1.4(1j) instead. (CSCtl22248. See the  [software deferral notice](http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/advisory.html?mdfid=283612660&flowid=22121&reltype=deferred&relind=DEFERRED&imageGuId=0DACA47E7DF0DEDE4FF24003EB2856F437D11D36&fdesc=).)

ESX

Symptom ESXi installation fails on RAID clusters with two SSDs on the B230 server. This is an LSI driver packaging issue in a particular ESXi distribution.

Workaround Be sure to use ESXi 4.0u2 or ESX-COS. (CSCtj63157)

Symptom Unable to install ESXi 4. *x* on systems with Intel M61KR-I, Emulex M72KR-E, Broadcom M51KR-B or Qlogic M72KR-Q CNA Adapters.

Workaround ESXi 4.0 U1, U2 or ESXi 4.1 does not have the updated drivers needed for these adapters so it will fail installation before trying to select an installation disk. The reason is that ESXi needs to load a network driver in order to install properly. The only adapter that is currently supported in ESXi versions prior to ESXi 4.0 U1, U2 and ESXi 4.1 is the Cisco M81KR. (CSCtj98207)

High Availability

Symptom High Availability does not become ready until all 3 selected HA devices (chassis/rack-unit) have been discovered. The condition that triggers this problem is the fact that a previously functioning and fully discovered device (either chassis or rack mount server) has failed. This may be due to connectivity problems or faulty behavior. In this case the system remains in HA NOT READY state.

Workaround The root of the problem is a failed device. Fixing the problem in the device is the first step. If the failure is persistent the faulty device can be decommissioned to resolve the problem. (CSCth17136)

Symptom When UCS Manager is operated in High Availability mode, SNMP traps stop arriving as expected if the SNMP trap IP header source address field is set to the cluster virtual IP address.

Workaround SNMP trap recipients must not use the SNMP trap IP header source address, or be prepared for it to contain the management IP address of the currently primary fabric interconnect. (CSCth69032)

BIOS

Symptom On B440 and B230 blades with a certain DIMM population, when a single DIMM is found faulty by the BIOS, other DIMMs will be marked faulty, and there is a potential for a BIOS POST failure. On the EX CPUs, the channels are grouped into “branches”. Each branch covers two adjacent channels. When a faulty DIMM is found on one channel, the other channel on the same branch will also be affected.

Workaround Replace all DIMMs on both channels affected. (CSCti46985)

Symptom The operating memory speed and operating memory voltage show up as “N/A” in discovered state, both in the GUI and CLI. These are new properties added in UCS 1.4(1) release. Also, UCSM will not be able to distinguish a BIOS-detected failed DIMM from a BIOS-detected ignored DIMM, on B440 and B230 servers. This should happen only for B440 and B230 servers, and should not happen for B200, B250, C200 and C250 servers, all of which provide SMBIOS table 203 support.

Workaround None available in the UCS 1.4(1) release. Upgrading to a BIOS version for B440 or B230 with 203 support is the only solution. (CSCth93460)

Symptom Blade and Rack Servers that include unequal sized HDDs or SSDs have encountered various failures intermittently. UCS Manager reports “Error Configuring Local Disk Controller” in most cases during these failures, though other errors are also seen.

Workaround Verify that the servers use equal sized disks from the same vendor. This ensures that all of the disks are of identical disk capacity. (CSCtk55618)

Symptom The blade appears to hang when pressing “Ctrl +C" multiple times during POST with “silent mode” enabled.

Workaround Disable “silent mode” or do not press “Ctrl + C” or keys that are not instructed during POST. (CSCtj61949)

Symptom The BIOS Setup shows less memory size and some DIMMs disabled on a B230. The SMBIOS table does not report memory info in Type 17 structure for the disabled DIMMs. The UCSM reports less memory size and some DIMMS disabled. This happens when the BIOS disables some DIMMs incorrectly when DIMMs on certain slots do not have the corresponding lockstep pairs installed. For example, configurations that can cause this failure include:

 **1.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) DIMM on slot C2 is not installed and slot C3 is installed - Causes DDR training failure that results in DIMM failure on slots C0,C1,C3,D0,D1,D2,D3.

 **2.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) DIMM on slot A1 is not installed - Disables DIMMs on slots A0, A2, A3. The NHM-EX CPU requires the DIMM0 in each DDR channel populated first before populating DIMM1 on that channel. This is an invalid configuration.

 **3.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) DIMM on slot B0 is not installed - Disables DIMMs on slots B1, B2, B3. The NHM-EX CPU requires the DIMM0 in each DDR channel populated first before populating DIMM1 on that channel. This is an invalid configuration.

Workaround Always populate the DIMMs in lockstep pairs, as described in the user documentation. The lockstep-ed DIMM slot pairs are A0 & A1, A2 & A3, B0 & B1, B2 & B3, C0 & C1, C2 & C3, D0 & D, and D2 & D3. Also, it is recommended to populate the DIMMs in the following order. Blue slot pairs, White slot pairs, Yellow slot pairs, Black slot pairs. (CSCtj67835)

CIMC

Symptom Network connection to CIMC is lost. There must be at least 400 host reboots or power-ons for this issue to be seen. And even with that many host reboots or power-ons, the issue may still not happen.

Symptom Reseat the blade. (CSCtk63908)

Symptom When using mirroring mode, if a UCE error happens, there is a Redundancy SEL event and also a UCE SEL event. No other details are available for the Data Parity error.

Workaround None. (CSCti94391)

Symptom For a B200-M2 when a blade is configured in Low Voltage mode, and a LPC reset is asserted it is possible for the 1.5V DDR3 sensors to cause threshold crossing SEL events. The LPC reset causes the DIMM voltage level to return to High Voltage Mode (Hardware Caused). This causes a race condition between IPMI code and the Voltage Mode monitor code. Given this race condition it is possible for IPMI to assert the threshold crossing before the monitor code notifies the IPMI stack of the Voltage Mode change. This can be identified by the fact you have a Upper Critical Voltage crossing right after a LPC reset when in LV mode.

Workaround 1.5V SEL entries at the time of reset can be ignored when the manual reading is not asserting past a threshold. (CSCti68905)

Adapters

Symptom When rack-server have mixed adapter vendor types, behavior is unpredictable.

Workaround None. Do not mix adapter vendors in rack-servers. (CSCti94883)

Symptom If the Windows SAN boot device is an EMC Clarion array and the adapter is a M72KR-E, SAN boot can fail with a blue screen. The frequency of the failure can go up if the storage is directly connected to the Fabric Interconnect.

Workaround None at this time. (CSCtk69120)

Symptom The link from the Rack server adapter to the fabric interconnect port remains down if the SFP type is FET (Fabric extender transceiver). Currently the FET type is supported only between a fabric extender and a fabric interconnect. If the SFP used for the link between the IOM and the rack server adapter is an FET, the link will remain down.

Workaround Replace the SFP with one of the supported SFPs for rack server adapters. (CSCtj89468)

Symptom CRC errors reported on an M81KR network interface on SLES 11 SP1. This is seen under High TX and RX traffic on SLES 11 SP1. The FIFO is not cleared as fast as it should because of some delays in the PCI path. An M81KR firmware devcmd storm from the host is also investigated to be one reason for the PCI stalls. These CRC errors are actually caused by FIFO overruns on the M81KR which are in turn caused by PCI stalls. They are not real CRC errors but truncated packets (due to FIFO overrun) flagged as CRC errors.

Workaround Reduce the traffic load to reduce the reported CRC errors. This assumes that the CRC errors in question are generated on M81KR and that there are no bad packets entering the adapter. (CSCtj82445)

UCS Manager

Symptom System detects a temporary version difference between primary and secondary switch during upgrade process from previous release to 1.4. As a result, DME process may generate a core file. The event does not impact system functionality in any way.

Workaround None. (CSCtl05066)

Symptom UCS Manager takes a long time to push configurations containing large number of port-profiles to the VMware Virtual Center (VC). This happens when large number of hosts and virtual machines (VMs) are configured (tested with 500 VMs on 60 hosts managed by same VC) and a large number of port-profiles assigned to multiple DVSes in the VCenter.

Symptom Wait until the operations complete. Configuration FSM could take more than 30 minutes. Then, configure a smaller number of port-profiles (we've measured up to 92 profiles to successfully configure in around 5 minutes in above large number of hosts and VMs situation). (CSCtk97755)

Symptom If a post on error token is set, and the BIOS later encounters an error during boot, the boot will be halted. Subsequent re-discovery or re-association would also halt during boot.

Workaround Connect to KVM and manually unset the token, and then unset the token from the BIOS policy. Or, unset the token from the BIOS policy and then decommission and recommission the server. (CSCtk96784)

Symptom When an associated blade is removed or re-inserted, BIOS tokens are not automatically re-deployed from UCS Manager. Previous BIOS settings will remain, but the BIOS screen will not be locked.

Workaround Re-acknowledge the blade. (CSCtk82286)

Symptom When 15 or more chassis are configured in Release 1.4(1) and the system is downgraded to release 1.3(1), chassis beyond 14 are still there. This may cause some issues as the max chassis support enabled with the 1.3(1) release is 14.

Workaround Manually decommission chassis in the system to keep the total number of chassis to 14 before downgrading to release 1.3(1) from 1.4(1). (CSCtk69231)

Symptom After a downgrade to version 1.1, a chassis or blade fails discovery. The system may not respond to connection requests on a virtual IP address. This was seen when a system was downgraded from version 1.4 to version 1.1 while some chassis or blade FSM were running. The condition is not handled properly by 1.1 code.

Workaround Clean up the objects (chassis or blades) that have scheduled FSMs by decommissioning them and re acknowledging them. If the virtual IP address has not been programmed, connect directly to the primary switch IP address. After chassis/blades have been recommissioned, reboot the primary switch. The subordinate takes over and the VIP is reprogrammed. After the Fabric extender finishes rebooting, it can be made primary again by forcing failover (to do this, connect to local-mgmt and use the “cluster lead X” command). (CSCtk68545)

Symptom Attempting to delete a VLAN or modify an Appliance Port/Port Channel triggers the error message “Config for Ethernet Port P doesn't exist for switch S.” When two or more VLANs (in global or local scope) that share the same ID are added to an Appliance Port/Port Channel and then when an Appliance Port/Port Channel is deleted or the port type of the Appliance port is changed to be different from an Appliance Port, without the corresponding VLAN association being removed, this condition will occur.

Workaround If the condition occurs, recreate the Appliance Port/Port Channel, delete all VLAN associations and then delete the Appliance Port/Port Channel. If the VLAN associations are deleted prior to deleting the Appliance Port/Port Channel, this condition will not occur. (CSCtl07693)

Symptom In order to speed up route convergence when a server (VNIC) is not reachable through one of the fabric paths (either A or B) the MAC sync feature was introduced in the 1.4.1 release of UCS which keeps the VNIC MAC address in sync between the Fabric Interconnects. This feature is not automatically enabled for service profiles that were associated and active before upgrade to the 1.4 version of UCS Manager and Fabric Interconnect software.

Workaround Disassociating and re-associating the service profile will automatically turn on this feature. For service profiles that are associated after upgrading to 1.4.1 version, this feature will be automatically turned on. (CSCtl05696)

Symptom The primary fabric interconnect fails to complete the reboot sequence, UCS Manager is not available, and Virtual IP does not respond. This can happen in an HA setup with two fabric interconnects, but one is permanently down and the other one is alive and it is primary, and the primary is rebooted. The problem occurs in one of the following configurations:

* The system contains only rack mount servers (no chassis).
* The system contains at least one rack mount server (in addition to chassis) and that rack mount server was selected as a repository for HA information. UCS Manager picks a total of 3 repositories so mixed configurations with less than 3 chassis are always affected.

Workaround Use the “cluster force lead” command on the primary node from the CLI. This will allow UCS Manager to finish initialization and enable the VIP for GUI access. (CSCtl05535)

Symptom When a rack server has a local disk installed, it does not report real-time disk operability status (disk operability is reported as “N/A”).

Workaround None. (CSCtj18969)

Symptom When the UCS Manager shell mode is set to s either management or local-management mode, the CLI command  **terminal monitor** is not available.

Workaround Use the  **terminal** command in NXOS mode. (CSCtj82918)

Symptom The minimum power cap that can currently be set is 3400W. The chassis power cap has a lower limit of 3778 W (AC), which is internally converted to 3400 W (DC).

Workaround Do not enter a cap below this requirement. This requirement was derived from the need to safely allow a chassis to simultaneously boot all blades in a chassis. (CSCtj62296)

Symptom The UCS Manager shell does not support redirection of  **show** command output to a remote file system.

Workaround Redirect the output to a local file in either  *workspace* : or  *volatile* : and then transfer the file to the remote system using the  **cp** command in local-mgmt mode. (CSCti87891)

Symptom A DIMM which is detected by the BMC as present but SMBIOS table 203 shows it as either failed or ignored, the DIMM will show up with location information but with an incorrect and random value for the speed property. As the DIMM is already detected as failed/ignored, the incorrect speed value may be ignored.

Workaround Replace the failed/ignored DIMM. (CSCtj96263)

Symptom In UCS Manager there is no option to change the port speed of the SPAN destination port.

Workaround Un-configure the SPAN destination port and make it an “uplink”. Change the port speed on the uplink port, then reconfigure the port as a SPAN destination port. The port speed will be at the value that user set for the “uplink” port. (CSCti86217)

Symptom UCS Manager reports an unsupported DIMM as missing but does not raise a fault.

Workaround Verify that the DIMM is a Cisco DIMM supported on that server model. (CSCtj51582)

Symptom Dynamic vNIC creation fails with a message saying the port profile is not available in NPPM. This will happen if you are trying to provision more than 180 port profiles, the maximum in Release 1.4(1).

Workaround Delete extra port profiles and retry. (CSCtj17237)

Symptom If you delete existing VMware data center objects & VCenter in the VM configuration tab, then create a new VCenter with the same IP address as previous VC server. UCS Manager sends an error stating “deletion of vCenter object is still in progress” and will not allow creation of new VCenter. The deletion of the previous VCenter had not succeeded and UCS Manager keeps retrying the deletion. Since 2 VCenters with same IP cannot exist in the system, UCS Manager disallows the second VC creation.

Workaround Manually delete the deletion task. I n the CLI, use the  **show pending-deletion** command to see pending deletion tasks then delete the appropriate task using the  **delete pending-deletion** and  **commit-buffer** commands. Using the GUI, the task can deleted by going to VM tab, then clicking VMware on left hand side, then going to the Deletion Tasks tab. (CSCtj03776)

UCS Manager GUI

Symptom Non-disruptive pending changes may not be shown on a service profile. When a service profile has a maintenance policy that defers the application of disrupting changes to the server, user can see what changes are pending and make further changes. Disruptive pending changes are always visible on the service profile, whereas non-disruptive changes may not be shown. Non-disruptive pending changes are only shown for user convenience. This defect has no functional impact.

Workaround None. (CSCtj57838)

UCS Manager CLI

Symptom When VIF creation doesn't follow V-motion, NPPM doesn't move the VIF to a new dynamic and the stale VIF doesn't carry the traffic any more. This would cause the SPAN to stop monitoring the traffic from the original VM.

Workaround Re-discover the AM’s and re-create the SPAN. (CSCtj78998)

Symptom When you use the  **show Cali history** command to view the commands executed in that shell, the time stamp field associated with each command is incorrect and shows up as 00:00:00.

Workaround None. (CSCtg97581)

UCS Manager Capability Catalog

Symptom The following DIMM is missing from the Capability Catalog in UCS Manager, including information about the product name, PID, and VID:

Product Name: 2x4GB Kit DDR3-1333MHz RDIMM/PC3-10600

 PID: A02-M308GB3-2

 VID: V01

 Vendor: 0x80CE

 Vendor Description: Samsung Electronics, Inc.

 Vendor Part Number: M393B5170FH0-YH9

 Vendor Serial (SN): 0x4247988F.

This issue is cosmetic and has no impact on functionality.

Workaround Customers who purchased this DIMM should download the following UCS Manager Capability Catalog update from Cisco.com: ucs-catalog.1.0.16.T.bin. For information on how to activate this Capability Catalog update in UCS Manager, follow the steps in the Cisco UCS Manager CLI Configuration Guide or the Cisco UCS Manager GUI Configuration Guide. (CSCtl07941)

Fabric Interconnect

Symptom Fabric interconnect activation during a downgrade from 1.4(1) to 1.3(1) will fail if the setup has an active Nexus 2248 fabric extender.

Workaround Decommission all fabric extenders and rack-servers and completely decommission the FSM before downgrading the fabric interconnect image. (CSCtk35213)

Symptom The show port-security NXOS CLI command returns a negative value for the Max Addresses. This will occur when a system is configured with more than 8192 Port VLAN instances and. port security is enabled on all interfaces such that more than 8192 MACs are secured.

Workaround Do not configure port-security such that secured Port VLAN instances is more than 8192. (CSCtj10809)

Symptom When an N2XX-ACPCI01 adapter port on a C-series server is connected to an uplink port on a UCS 6100 fabric interconnect, a fault message should appear because this connection is not supported, but there is no such fault message for this situation in this release.

Workaround None. (CSCti85875)

CIMC

Symptom False SEL events are generated for CPU temperature sensors. These SEL events can occur shortly after power on of the host. A deassertion SEL event will be generated shortly after the assertion of the critical threshold crossing (1-10s after). On power on of the host, readings from the PECI bus to the processor sometimes returns zero. This is zero reading causes the thermal SEL event.

Symptom If the thermal assertion is quickly followed by a thermal deassertion, the original assertion should be ignored. (CSCtl04398)

Symptom Rack server does not show up in GUI or CLI within reasonable delay after a recommission. This happens when a rack server is recommissioned within a very short time of its decommissioning. The server has a DHCP lease expiration time from when it was decommissioned, which is a few minutes.

Workaround After decommissioning, wait a few minutes before recommissioning a rack server. (CSCtj55009)

Symptom The Blade CIMstic management IP address assignment is not included in backups.

Workaround Manually record the blade CIMC static management IP address assignments, and re-enter them if necessary. (CSCtj93577)

Symptom The Disk Fault/Error Codes, Disk Status, Alarms and the failures forwarded by the SAS Controller are not received by UCS Manager.

Workaround None. (CSCsy76853)

RAID/Local Disk

Symptom UCS Manager fails to report the Local Disk Failures, Faults, Alarms, Status and Disk Errors/Error Codes from the MegaRAID Controller on the B440 server.

Workaround None. (CSCtf73879)

Symptom For the B200 and B250 blade servers, the Local Disks 'Operability' field is reported as “N/A”. The 'Operability' field of the Local Disks in B200 and B250 is expected to have a correct value and should not be reporting 'N/A'.

Workaround None. (CSCtj03021)

Symptom For the MegaRAID Controller on the B440 blade server, UCS Manager fails to report BBU Status, Properties and Errors.

Workaround None. (CSCtf84982)

Symptom If one or more conditions are met, UCS Manager fails to capture certain Local Disk errors. Conditions include: Mixing the SAS and SATA Local Disks in the same server; Disk spin-up or disks present but not reaching 'Ready' state; Missing Disks.

Workaround None. (CSCtj48519)

Symptom UCS Manager does not include the implementation for the Write Through, Write Back, and Write back with BBU MegaRAID Battery (BBU) Write Policies for the B440 server.

Workaround None. (CSCtf17708)

Symptom C210 and C250 rack servers are missing RAID 50 and RAID 60 support.

Workaround None. (CSCti39470)

Symptom For B200 and B250 blade servers. The Local Disks 'Operability' field is reported as “N/A”.

Workaround None. (CSCti39470)

Symptom UCS Manager fails to create a single disk striped RAID config in the Storage Controller 1064E environment.

Workaround None. (CSCtj89447)

### Caveats from Previous Releases

### Release 1.3(1)

### The following caveats were opened in Release 1.3(1i):

Symptom During Server Association, the following configuration error is reported - “Missing or Incompatible BIOS Image”.

Workaround None. (CSCth84003)

Symptom FSM gets stuck in an Error Configuring the Local Disk Controller state due to various underlying conditions. Those can include but are not limited to the following:

* The Local Disks not getting discovered correctly or are “available/presence-Equipped” but not in a Ready state.
* Failures that can't be correctly communicated to Cisco UCS Manager can get reported as this type of error.

Workaround Remove and insert all of the local disks from the failing server, then re-acknowledge the server. (CSCta45805)

Symptom CIMC or BIOS fails to confirm that a board is running in low voltage mode before setting threshold. When threshold is set for low voltage and the board runs at high voltage, a SEL event occurs and causes amber lights to display.

For example, here is an error message for a B200-M2 with a low voltage DIMM and CPU. Voltage levels (column 2) are similar to the boards with high voltage components. The threshold is set for LV (columns 5 and 6, 9 and 10).

1V5\_DDR3\_P2 | 1.523 | Volts | nr | 1.213 | 1.290 | na | na | 1.407 | 1.494

P1V5\_DDR3\_P1 | 1.513 | Volts | nr | 1.213 | 1.290 | na | na | 1.407 | 1.494

P0V75\_DDR3\_P1 | 0.757 | Volts | nr | 0.601 | 0.640 | na | na | 0.708 | 0.747

P0V75\_DDR3\_P2 | 0.757 | Volts | nr | 0.601 | 0.640 | na | na | 0.708 | 0.747

Workaround None. Resolved in 1.3(1n). (CSCth93217)

### The following caveats were opened in Release 1.3(1c), if they are resolved in later builds it is mentioned:

Symptom The UCS Manager GUI fails to provide the Local Disk Configuration Policy details if you make global policy changes and then select the Local Disk Configuration Policy after selecting the service profile.

Workaround Select a different service profile or a different GUI pane window and then return back to the service profile which was showing this issue. (CSCth95564)

Symptom When using M2 processors and Low Voltage DIMMs, the following error log messages may be seen for P0V75\_DDR3\_P1 and P1V5\_DDR3\_P1:

Line 503: 1f7 | 07/06/2010 10:33:44 | BMC | Voltage

P0V75\_DDR3\_P2 #0x14 | Lower critical - going low | Asserted | Reading 0.64 < Threshold 0.64 Volts

Line 418: 1a2 | 12/31/1969 19:00:36 | BMC | Voltage P1V5\_DDR3\_P2 #0x09 | Lower critical - going low | Asserted | Reading 1.33 < Threshold 1.44 Volts

Workaround None. Resolved in 1.3(1i). (CSCth70776)

UCS Manager

Symptom SNMP authentication fails when using user details configured from a third party authentication server like RADIUS and subsequently all SNMPv3 requests fail. Network management tools like Device Manager (DM), Fabric Manager (FM) will not be able to retrieve information from the UCS through SNP and are unable to display important information. SNMP only recognizes two roles "network-operator" or “vdc-admin”. User accounts created on a RADIUS server who do not have these roles will not be authorized to access SNMP details.

Workaround Add “network-operator” or “vdc-admin” as roles to the user accounts in the RADIUS server. (CSCtg94770)

Symptom A standard attempt to execute Update Firmware ALL fails with a dependency on a deployed FW pack.

Workaround Follow the error message to execute Update All, i.e., Modify the policy to execute the update. (CSCtc69186)

Red Hat Linux

Symptom When installing ESX 4.0 or ESX 4.0 Update 1 on a server with more than 190GB of physical memory, booting the ESX host fails and opens the recovery shell

Workaround For ESX 4.0 and ESX 4.0 Update 1, reduce the low reserved memory by setting the boot option “memLowReservedMaxMB” to 384MB. In the bootloader console, append the following to the command line: vmkopts=memLowReservedMaxMB:384. Depending on the types of devices in your network, you may have to increase the amount of low reserved-memory to achieve a better performance. For more detail, refer to:  <http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1016239> (CSCtf61345)

Symptom Loading multiple driver disks during a RHEL 5. *x* installation fails.

Workaround Refer to the article at http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-17753 (CSCte73015)

Symptom When a vNIC is not in failover mode and a link down event occurs, the network traffic on the blades is disrupted with a system running RHEL 5.3.

Workaround This is a known issue with the ixgbe driver in RHEL 5.3 and because RHEL 5.4 is the latest release, Red Hat recommends upgrading the systems to the RHEL 5.4. If you cannot upgrade to RHEL 5.4, below are a few suggestions that has been found to work.

 **1.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Restart the network.

service network restart

or

ifdown ethx

ifup ethx

 **2.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Run your system with nomsi.

* Edit /etc/grub.conf
* Add pci=nomsi to the kernel line
* Restart the system with this kernel

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Network performance may be affected since the system is running in legacy mode. (CSCte44548)

---

Symptom Pass-through DMA Support selection is not available in the BIOS if it was Disabled prior to the BIOS upgrade. If you had this option Disabled in previous version, the selection is hidden in the updated BIOS.

Workaround When you are in the BIOS Setup utility, press F9 to Load the BIOS defaults (CSCtb96792)

Local Disk/RAID

Symptom After the removal or insertion of one or more local disks, their full discovery fails.

Workaround Re-acknowledge the server to complete the full discovery. (CSCsy80888)

Symptom The disk scrub policy does not meet DoD compliance.

Workaround None. (CSCsy20036)

BIOS

Symptom Hubs that only use USB 1.0 may not properly present an attached USB device to the UCS server.

Workaround Avoid using USB hubs that are exclusively USB 1.0 capable. Virtually all USB hubs sold today are USB 1.0/2.0 capable. (CSCtb20301)

Symptom With the B-250 blade server, the displayed ESX and Linux OS HDD Boot Device Order is the reverse of the BIOS HDD Boot Order.

Workaround Review both the disks (and drive labels as applicable) during installations of ESX and Linux versions and choose the correct disk for installation. (CSCtd90695)

Symptom When memory mirroring configuration is disabled by removing a DIMM, the BIOS will switch to the Performance mode, and will not log a SEL that mirroring was disabled.

Workaround Check the status of the memory mirroring in **BIOS Setup->Advanced -> Memory Configuration -> Memory RAS and Performance Configuration**. (CSCsy54097)

Symptom When a faulty DIMM is detected in early BIOS POST (e.g. the blade was powered on with a faulty DIMM), two SEL entries will be sent to the CIMC. One entry will be logged for each DIMM.

Workaround Enter BIOS Setup and navigate to  **Advanced -> Memory Configuration**. This menu will help to distinguish a faulty DIMM from its neighbor. (CSCsy97698)

Symptom When hot plugging or removing USB devices at a BIOS Setup -> Advanced -> USB screen, the Setup Utility may freeze.

Workaround Reboot the server. (CSCsz41907)

Symptom Installing EFI Native SLES 11 is not supported in this release.

Workaround Currently, there is no workaround. (CSCsz99666)

Symptom Disabling USB 2.0 through  **Advanced->USB** could result in inconsistent information on that particular page. Some devices may not show up as expected. This does not results in functional degradation during POST.

Workaround Either don't disable USB 2.0, or ignore the resulting artifacts in the BIOS setup. (CSCta21849)

Symptom After resetting the CMOS the system date needs to be reset to current.

Workaround None. (CSCtb12390)

Adapters

Symptom Failure to PXE boot a UCS server with an M81KR adapter, and there is an indication that a boot file is not found. This is seen when the DHCP server is using option 67 (RFC 2132) to report the bootfile name to the PXE client.

Workaround Use the DHCP “filename” setting instead of the “option file-name” setting for ISC DHCP servers or the equivalent for other DHCP servers. (CSCtl91488)

Symptom With a server booting from SAN, a server crash may occur when an FC HBA is reset, or when a WWPN is zoned in or out on a core fabric switch, or a link flap event occurs either between the NPV switch and the host, or between the NPV switch and the core switch, or the core switch and storage. The symptoms of this problem include server hangs during normal operation, whether or not I/Os happen. It may either remain hung, or may panic and reboot. Upon a reboot, a vmcore file may or may not be present in /var/crash/ depending on whether sync to disk succeeded or not. Alternatively, the server may not crash or hang but can encounter a journal commit I/O error and the boot partition (located on a SAN LUN) will become a read-only file system. The server stays up, but nothing can be written to the necessary partition.

Workaround There is no workaround other than not booting from SAN. If the OS is RHEL, the fix for this issue will be in RHEL 5.5.z, and upgrading to that kernel is recommended when it releases. (CSCtf81596)

Symptom When a DCBXP peer on a physical interface sends two different unique identifiers in the Protocol data unit in the same session, a DCBXP process error disables the port.

Workaround Issue the following commands to enable the port:

scope chassis *<Chassis Id>*

scope server *<Server Id>*

scope adapter *<Adapter Id>*

scope ext-eth-if *<Id>*

set adminstate reset-connectivity

commit-buffer

Wait for a minute, the port will come up.(CSCsx42435)

KVM

Symptom During the Server Power-State Management, the KVM session may be aborted with a message displaying “Network Connection Dropped”.

Workaround Close the KVM session(s) that have been aborted and open a new KVM session. (CSCtc53253)

Cisco UCS Manager

Symptom Information about the number of CPU cores enabled is unavailable. Along with the other processor information, the UCS manager GUI and CLI don't show this info.

Workaround None. (CSCte12172)

Symptom A SMASH Command with an incorrect option should result in an ”INVALID OPTION” error.

Workaround No work-around required. The message displayed is “COMMAND SYNTAX ERROR”. (CSCsv87256)

Symptom The PCIe Address for the Cisco UCS M81KR Virtual Interface Card is not seen in the GUI (or CLI). It causes no functional impact.

Workaround The only work around is to boot some host OS onto the blade and then determine the PCI address and map it to the MAC address (and subsequently to the VNIC). In a 2.6 kernel based Linux for instance, the /sys/class/net/<device> directory has relevant information. (CSCte58483)

Symptom Modification of trusted CoS policy in Service Profile does not get immediately applied to the server. If you modify the trusted CoS policy of an adapter profile in a service profile that is currently attached to a physical server, a server reboot is needed. Since it is unsafe to automatically reboot an associated server, UCSM currently does not.

Workaround Manually reboot the server or disassociate and reassociate the server to get the CoS policy to be applied. (CSCte44668)

Symptom Environment statistics for IO Module 1 are not shown.

Workaround None. (CSCtd14585)

Symptom For each Cisco UCS 82598KR-CI 10 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, 2 interfaces show up in the OS and ethtool reports Link Detected = yes for both of them. This is only seen on Cisco UCS B250 servers.

Workaround Use the MAC that has the value provisioned in the service profile. (CSCtd14055)

Symptom One vNIC defined in the service profile boot order results in two BIOS vNICs.

Workaround Avoid defining two different pxelinux.cfg/<MAC> files that have different boot/install instructions. When booted, both vNICs should execute the same PXE configuration. (CSCsz41107)

Symptom After a full restore of the primary fabric interconnect, the subordinate fabric interconnect installation may temporarily fail with the following message:

Enter the admin password of the peer switch:

 Connecting to peer switch... unable to connect! Password could be wrong.

 Hit enter to try again or type 'restart' to start setup from beginning...

Workaround Retry the fabric interconnect installation. (CSCsz85876)

Symptom For a given port profile with existing VIFs, if the “Max-Ports” setting is reduced from the currently configured value to a value less than the “Used-Ports” value reported for that port profile by VMware vCenter, this is a mis-configuration. The new value for “Max-Ports” for that port profile will only be updated in Cisco UCS Manager and its update in VMware Center will fail, causing a inconsistency between Cisco UCS Manager and VMware Center Server.

Workaround If the need arises to reduce the value of “Max-Ports” of a given port profile, the new value should be at least the value of “Used-Ports” reported by the VMware Center for all the DVSes for that port profile (not lower than maximum of all the “Used-Ports” values). This constraint has to be ensured manually. (CSCte12163)

Symptom When a service profile containing 2 vNICs and having failover enabled is applied to some adapters, the fail back timeout specified in the adapter policy for the second vNIC has no effect. The fail back timeout specified in the adapter policy and applied to the first vNIC is applied to the whole adapter and effective for both vNICs.

Workaround Specify the desired timeout in the adapter policy and apply to the first vNIC. (CSCsz68887)

Symptom Cisco UCS Manager reports incorrect v NICs or VIFs associated with a given Virtual Machine if and only if the Virtual Machine is deployed from VMware Center in Fault-Tolerance (Active-Standby) mode and the Virtual Machine happens to be the standby or FT Virtual Machine.

Workaround None. (CSCte45010)

Symptom When firmware is updated, UCSM accepts another firmware update before the completion of the current update. The new request will fail silently and lock out the selected firmware package for the next update.

Workaround Create a new host firmware package with a different name from the one that gets locked out which points to the same BIOS package. The new package with a different name, using the same BIOS will not be locked out. (CSCtc26149)

Cisco UCS Manager GUI

Symptom When upgrading from releases prior to 1.1.1, OS-specific default adapter policies will not have the current recommended default values.

Workaround After an upgrade from a release prior to 1.1.1, we recommend manually changing the adapter policy parameters to the following values:

Eth VMWare->RSS: Disabled

Eth VMWarePassThru->RSS: Enabled

Eth default->RSS: Enabled

FC (all)->FCP Error Recovery: Disabled

FC (all)->Flogi Retries: 8

FC (all)->Flogi Timeout: 4000

FC (all)->Plogi Timeout: 20000

FC (all)->IO Throttle Count: 16

FC (all)->Max LUNs Per Target: 256

(CSCte58155)

Symptom The UCSM GUI could show all DIMMs to be in array 1, and maximum memory for a blade of 192GB for a B200.

Workaround This is a display-only issue, and does not affect functionality. DIMMs may be physically located in array 1 or array 2. (CSCta56527)

Symptom Hardware revision numbers for fabric interconnect components are not populated in the Cisco UCS Manager.

Workaround Enter the **connect nxos** command to connect to the native NX-OS CLI, then issue the appropriate  **show sprom**  *component* command and look for  **H/W Version:** field in the command output. (CSCta12005)

Symptom In the Cisco UCS Manager GUI, you can only select port channels and individual uplink ports as pin targets, but the Cisco UCS Manager CLI allows you to also select port channel member ports as pin targets.

Workaround Port channel member ports should not be selected as pin targets, even if the Cisco UCS Manager CLI allows you to. (CSCta60495)

Symptom Even though there are no POST failures in the chassis, Cisco UCS Manager may sometimes display the overall status of the chassis as POST-failure.

Workaround Check the chassis POST messages for errors, and if there are none, ignore the Cisco UCS Manager status message. (CSCsz01878)

Symptom Statistics counters cannot be cleared using Cisco UCS Manager CLI.

Workaround Clear the counters using the Cisco UCS Manager GUI. (CSCsz47512)

Symptom When a cluster configuration is set up such that I/O module 1 is cabled to fabric interconnect B and I/O module 2 is cabled to fabric interconnect A, then the Ethernet devices are given ports 1 and 0. However if the setup is straight, with I/O Module 1 connected to fabric interconnect A and I/O Module 2 to fabric interconnect B, then the devices are assigned ports 0 and 1.

Workaround Connect IOM1 to fabric-interconnect A, and IOM2 to fabric-interconnect B. (CSCtb35660)

Symptom Logon access is denied for user accounts where the password field was left blank during user account creation.

Workaround When creating a user account, ensure that a secure password for the account is specified. (CSCta21326)

Symptom When more than 10 Cisco UCS Manager GUI sessions are open at the same time with remote authentication for a long time (typically for a few hours), one of the Cisco UCS Manager GUI sessions may fail to re-authenticate. This causes the session that fails the re-authentication to close. The problem does not happen when local authentication is in use.

Workaround Re-login to the Cisco UCS Manager GUI session when it closes. (CSCtb05260)

Symptom If you move from subnet A to subnet B then do a cluster failover and move back to subnet A, a Virtual IP is no longer pingable.

Workaround Set the VIP to a different VIP by using the following CLI commands to set it back to the original address:

**scope system**

**set set virtual-ip** *<new address>*

**commit**

(CSCtc55636)

UCS Manager CLI

Symptom The UUID of the VM changes in VMware vCenter. After a VM restarts, the virtual machine node on the VM tab shows multiple instances of the same VM with one online and one offline.

Workaround After the VM retention period configured in the VM life cycle policy has passed, Cisco UCS Manager deletes the offline instance automatically. (CSCtc86297)

Symptom If multiple vHBA initiators are configured in the same zone so that they are visible to each other and can login to each other, and storage multipathing is not configured with active and standby paths through the Cisco UCS fabric interconnects (There is only one path through the primary fabric interconnect), and the primary fabric interconnect is rebooted, the vHBA driver can be exposed to a situation in which two initiators can try to login to each other at the same time, and cause a host crash.

Workaround Do not configure multiple vHBA initiators in the same zone, to ensure that they are not visible to each other. (CSCte36784)

Symptom ESX Read and Write commands sent on a vHBA keep timing out and being aborted even if the target device is logged into the network. This can happen if the link flaps very fast from up to down to up and memory allocation for the link event fails. The vHBA driver misses the link down event and it does not re-login to the fabric interconnect. The fabric interconnect, however, has no login state for the vHBA and so drops all packets from the vHBA.

Workaround Disable and re-enable the port on the UCS fabric interconnect that corresponds to the vHBA. (CSCte08092)

Fabric Interconnect

Symptom Without pin group configuration, server interfaces are pinned to uplink interfaces of the fabric interconnect dynamically and the pinning is redistributed as uplink interfaces go up or down. In some situations, the distribution of server interfaces across uplink interfaces is not balanced. Potential impact is some uplinks are under utilized.

Workaround None. (CSCsv92356)

Symptom At bootup of the fabric interconnect, the following message will be displayed on the console: “The startup-config won't be used until the next reboot.”

Workaround None, just ignore the message. (CSCsx13134)

Symptom Console login is treating the admin and ADMIN account as the same. Console login name on the fabric interconnect is not case sensitive, so there is no differentiation between e.g. 'admin' and 'ADMIN'.

Workaround Implement usernames that are not case sensitive. (CSCsy15489)

Symptom Under high stress on the system with repeated port flapping and a default or native VLAN changing simultaneously, a process may cause the fabric interconnect to reload.

Workaround None. (CSCta09325)

Symptom The **show cdp neighbor**  command does not display information for CDP neighbors seen from the management interface, nor does it display the fabric interconnect CDP information corresponding to the management interface.

Workaround None. (CSCta25287)

Symptom With FM/DM version 5.0(0.295) and UCS 1.1 release, a security user defined in Cisco UCS Manager does not get displayed on FM/DM.

Workaround None. Verify user security from Cisco UCS Manager. (CSCte25876)

### Release 1.2(1)

### The following caveats were opened in Release 1.2(1):

Red Hat Linux

Symptom Loading multiple driver disks during a RHEL 5. *x* installation fails.

Workaround Refer to the article at http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-17753 (CSCte73015)

Symptom When a vNIC is not in failover mode and a link down event occurs, the network traffic on the blades is disrupted with a system running RHEL 5.3.

Workaround This is a known issue with the ixgbe driver in RHEL 5.3 and because RHEL 5.4 is the latest release, Red Hat recommends upgrading the systems to the RHEL 5.4. If you cannot upgrade to RHEL 5.4, below are a few suggestions that has been found to work.

 **1.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Restart the network.

service network restart

or

ifdown ethx

ifup ethx

 **2.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Run your system with nomsi.

* Edit /etc/grub.conf
* Add pci=nomsi to the kernel line
* Restart the system with this kernel

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

Symptom Pass-through DMA Support selection is not available in the BIOS if it was Disabled prior to the BIOS upgrade. If you had this option Disabled in previous version, the selection is hidden in the updated BIOS.

Workaround When you are in the BIOS Setup utility, press F9 to Load the BIOS defaults (CSCtb96792)

Local Disk/RAID

Symptom After the removal or insertion of one or more local disks, their full discovery fails.

Workaround Re-acknowledge the server to complete the full discovery. (CSCsy80888)

Symptom The Disk Fault/Error Codes, Disk Status, Alarms and the failures forwarded by the SAS Controller are not received by Cisco UCS Manager.

Workaround None. (CSCsy76853)

Symptom FSM gets stuck in an Error Configuring the Local Disk Controller state due to various underlying conditions. Those can include but are not limited to the following:

* The Local Disks not getting discovered correctly or are “available/presence-Equipped” but not in a Ready state.
* Failures that can't be correctly communicated to Cisco UCS Manager can get reported as this type of error.

Workaround Remove and insert all of the local disks from the failing server, then re-acknowledge the server. (CSCta45805)

Symptom The disk scrub policy does not meet DoD compliance.

Workaround None. (CSCsy20036)

BIOS

Symptom Hubs that only use USB 1.0 may not properly present an attached USB device to the UCS server.

Workaround Avoid using USB hubs that are exclusively USB 1.0 capable. Virtually all USB hubs sold today are USB 1.0/2.0 capable. (CSCtb20301)

Symptom With the B-250 blade server, the displayed ESX and Linux OS HDD Boot Device Order is the reverse of the BIOS HDD Boot Order.

Workaround Review both the disks (and drive labels as applicable) during installations of ESX and Linux versions and choose the correct disk for installation. (CSCtd90695)

Symptom When memory mirroring configuration is disabled by removing a DIMM, the BIOS will switch to the Performance mode, and will not log a SEL that mirroring was disabled.

Workaround Check the status of the memory mirroring in **BIOS Setup->Advanced -> Memory Configuration -> Memory RAS and Performance Configuration**. (CSCsy54097)

Symptom When a faulty DIMM is detected in early BIOS POST (e.g. the blade was powered on with a faulty DIMM), two SEL entries will be sent to the CIMC. One entry will be logged for each DIMM.

Workaround Enter BIOS Setup and navigate to  **Advanced -> Memory Configuration**. This menu will help to distinguish a faulty DIMM from its neighbor. (CSCsy97698)

Symptom When hot plugging or removing USB devices at a BIOS Setup -> Advanced -> USB screen, the Setup Utility may freeze.

Workaround Reboot the server. (CSCsz41907)

Symptom Installing EFI Native SLES 11 is not supported in this release.

Workaround Currently, there is no workaround. (CSCsz99666)

Symptom Disabling USB 2.0 through  **Advanced->USB** could result in inconsistent information on that particular page. Some devices may not show up as expected. This does not results in functional degradation during POST.

Workaround Either don't disable USB 2.0 (we are not aware of any need to disable it), or ignore the resulting artifacts in the BIOS setup. (CSCta21849)

Symptom After resetting the CMOS the system date needs to be reset to current.

Workaround None. (CSCtb12390)

Red Hat Linux

Adapters

Symptom With a server booting from SAN, a server crash may occur when an FC HBA is reset, or when a WWPN is zoned in or out on a core fabric switch, or a link flap event occurs either between the NPV switch and the host, or between the NPV switch and the core switch, or the core switch and storage.

Workaround Do not configure multiple vHBA initiators in the same zone, to ensure that they are not visible to each other. (CSCte36784)

Symptom ESX Read and Write commands sent on a vHBA keep timing out and being aborted even if the target device is logged into the network. This can happen if the link flaps very fast from up to down to up and memory allocation for the link event fails. The vHBA driver misses the link down event and it does not re-login to the fabric interconnect. The fabric interconnect, however, has no login state for the vHBA and so drops all packets from the vHBA.

Workaround Disable and reenable the port on the UCS fabric interconnect that corresponds to the vHBA. (CSCte08092)

### Release 1.1(1)

### The following caveat is open for Release 1.1(1l), most Release 1.1(1j) caveats also apply unless they are listed as resolved for Release 1.1(1l):

Symptom Pass-through DMA Support selection is not available in the BIOS if it was Disabled prior to the BIOS upgrade. If you had this option Disabled in previous version, the selection is hidden in the updated BIOS.

Workaround When you are in the BIOS Setup utility, press F9 to Load the BIOS defaults (CSCtb96792)

This section lists the open caveats in Release 1.1(1j).

BIOS

Symptom Low Voltage DIMMs marked as Identity Not Established and are not included in the PID catalog.

Workaround None. Disregard the message, the DIMMs are fully functional and the error state is a false positive. Closed in 1.1(1m). (CSCtg86520)

Symptom With the B-250 blade server, the displayed ESX and Linux OS HDD Boot Device Order is the reverse of the BIOS HDD Boot Order.

Workaround Review both the disks (and drive labels as applicable) during installations of ESX and Linux versions and choose the correct disk for installation. (CSCtd90695)

Symptom When memory mirroring configuration is disabled by removing a DIMM, BIOS will switch to the Performance mode, and will not log a SEL that mirroring was disabled.

Workaround Check the status of the memory mirroring in **BIOS Setup->Advanced -> Memory Configuration -> Memory RAS and Performance Configuration**. (CSCsy54097)

Symptom When a faulty DIMM is detected in early BIOS POST (e.g. the blade was powered on with a faulty DIMM), two SEL entries will be sent to the BMC. One entry will be logged for each DIMM.

Workaround Enter BIOS Setup and navigate to  **Advanced -> Memory Configuration**. This menu will help to distinguish a faulty DIMM from its neighbor. (CSCsy97698)

Symptom When hot plugging or removing USB devices at a BIOS Setup -> Advanced -> USB screen, the Setup Utility may freeze.

Workaround Reboot the server. (CSCsz41907)

Symptom Installing EFI Native SLES 11 is not supported in this release.

Workaround Currently, there is no workaround. (CSCsz99666)

Symptom Disabling USB 2.0 through  **Advanced->USB** could result in inconsistent information on that particular page. Some devices may not show up as expected. This does not results in functional degradation during POST.

Workaround Either don't disable USB 2.0 (we are not aware of any need to disable it), or ignore the resulting artifacts in the BIOS setup. (CSCta21849)

Symptom FSM gets stuck in an Error Configuring the Local Disk Controller state due to various underlying conditions. Those can include but are not limited to the following:

* The Local Disks not getting discovered correctly or are “available/presence-Equipped” but not in a Ready state.
* Failures that can't be correctly communicated to Cisco UCS Manager can get reported as this type of error.

Workaround Remove and insert all of the local disks from the failing server, then re-acknowledge the server. (CSCta45805)

Symptom The Disk Fault/Error Codes, Disk Status, Alarms and the failures forwarded by the SAS Controller are not received by Cisco UCS Manager.

Workaround None. (CSCsy76853)

Symptom After resetting the CMOS the system date needs to be reset to current.

Workaround None. (CSCtb12390)

Red Hat Linux

Symptom When a vNIC is not in failover mode and a link down event occurs, the network traffic on the blades is disrupted with a system running RHEL 5.3.

Workaround This is a known issue with the ixgbe driver in RHEL 5.3 and because RHEL 5.4 is the latest release, Redhat recommends upgrading the systems to the RHEL 5.4. If you cannot upgrade to RHEL 5.4, below are a few suggestions that has been found to work.

 **1.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Restart the network.

service network restart

or

ifdown ethx

ifup ethx

 **2.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Run your system with nomsi.

* Edit /etc/grub.conf
* Add pci=nomsi to the kernel line
* Restart the system with this kernel

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Network performance may be affected since the system is running in legacy mode. (CSCte44548)

---

Adapters

Symptom When a DCBXP peer on a physical interface sends two different unique identifiers in the Protocol data unit in the same session, a DCBXP process error disables the port.

Workaround Issue the following commands to enable the port:

scope chassis *<Chassis Id>*

scope server *<Server Id>*

scope adapter *<Adapter Id>*

scope ext-eth-if *<Id>*

set adminstate reset-connectivity

commit-buffer

Wait for a minute, the port will come up.(CSCsx42435)

KVM

Symptom During the Server Power-State Management, the KVM session may be aborted with a message displaying “Network Connection Dropped”.

Workaround Close the KVM session(s) that have been aborted and open a new KVM session. (CSCtc53253)

Cisco UCS Manager

Symptom UCSM 1.1.(1j) firmware activation during UCS firmware upgrade will result in a server. reboot. Customers upgrading their systems from the 1.0.1 or 1.0.2 release to the 1.1(1j) release will experience an unexpected server reboot upon UCSM component activation. This is a result of an incorrect setting of the internal VNIC/VHBA property called lifecycle, that makes the system believe that reconfiguration of these objects is required. This reconfiguration triggers a server reboot.

Workaround No workaround currently exists. Customers can install the 1.1.(1j) release if a server reboot is acceptable for their firmware upgrade scenario and a maintenance window is scheduled. Customers that do not consider a server reboot as an acceptable condition during UCSM FW activation, should install release 1.1(1m). (CSCtf02353)

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) BIOS and interface card firmware upgrade still require a server reboot. Customers are expected to continue their operations after UCS firmware upgrade with a new BIOS and Interface Card firmware. Therefore the server reboot described in CSCtf02353 is an unexpected condition on UCSM activation, but still fits in the current firmware upgrade completion requirements.

---

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) CSCtf02353 will not be a problem on newly purchased systems that ship with Release 1.1.(1j).

---

Symptom The disk scrub policy does not meet DoD compliance.

Workaround None. (CSCsy20036)

Symptom After the removal or insertion of one or more local disks, their full discovery fails.

Workaround Re-acknowledge the server to complete the full discovery. (CSCsy80888)

Symptom One vNIC defined in the service profile boot order results in two BIOS vNICs.

Workaround Avoid defining two different pxelinux.cfg/<MAC> files that have different boot/install instructions. When booted, both vNICs should execute the same PXE configuration. (CSCsz41107)

Symptom After a full restore of the primary fabric interconnect, the subordinate fabric interconnect installation may temporarily fail with the following message:

Enter the admin password of the peer switch:

 Connecting to peer switch... unable to connect! Password could be wrong.

 Hit enter to try again or type 'restart' to start setup from beginning...

Workaround Retry the fabric interconnect installation. (CSCsz85876)

Symptom For a given port profile with existing VIFs, if the “Max-Ports” setting is reduced from the currently configured value to a value less than the “Used-Ports” value reported for that port profile by VMware vCenter, this is a mis-configuration. The new value for “Max-Ports” for that port profile will only be updated in Cisco UCS Manager and its update in VMware Center will fail, causing a inconsistency between Cisco UCS Manager and VMware Center Server.

Workaround If the need arises to reduce the value of “Max-Ports” of a given port profile, the new value should be at least the value of “Used-Ports” reported by the VMware Center for all the DVSes for that port profile (not lower than maximum of all the “Used-Ports” values). This constraint has to be ensured manually. (CSCte12163)

Symptom When a service profile containing 2 vNICs and having failover enabled is applied to some adapters, the fail back timeout specified in the adapter policy for the second vNIC has no effect. The fail back timeout specified in the adapter policy and applied to the first vNIC is applied to the whole adapter and effective for both vNICs.

Workaround Specify the desired timeout in the adapter policy and apply to the first vNIC. (CSCsz68887)

Symptom Cisco UCS Manager reports incorrect v NICs or VIFs associated with a given Virtual Machine if and only if the Virtual Machine is deployed from VMware Center in Fault-Tolerance (Active-Standby) mode and the Virtual Machine happens to be the standby or FT Virtual Machine.

Workaround None. (CSCte45010)

Cisco UCS Manager GUI

Symptom The UCSM GUI could show all DIMMs to be in array 1, and maximum memory for a blade of 192GB for a B200.

Workaround This is a display-only issue, and does not affect functionality. DIMMs may be physically located in array 1 or array 2. (CSCta56527)

Symptom Hardware revision numbers for fabric interconnect components are not populated in the Cisco UCS Manager.

Workaround Enter the **connect nxos** command to connect to the native NX-OS CLI, then issue the appropriate  **show sprom**  *component* command and look for  **H/W Version:** field in the command output. (CSCta12005)

Symptom In the Cisco UCS Manager GUI, you can only select port channels and individual uplink ports as pin targets, but the Cisco UCS Manager CLI allows you to also select port channel member ports as pin targets.

Workaround Port channel member ports should not be selected as pin targets, even if the Cisco UCS Manager CLI allows you to. (CSCta60495)

Symptom Even though there are no POST failures in the chassis, Cisco UCS Manager may sometimes display the overall status of the chassis as POST-failure.

Workaround Check the chassis POST messages for errors, and if there are none, ignore the Cisco UCS Manager status message. (CSCsz01878)

Symptom Statistics counters cannot be cleared using Cisco UCS Manager CLI.

Workaround Clear the counters using the Cisco UCS Manager GUI. (CSCsz47512)

Symptom In Cisco UCS Manager GUI, if the  **Reboot on boot Order Change** checkbox is checked for a boot policy, and if CD-ROM or Floppy is the last device in the boot order, then deleting or adding the device does not directly affect the boot order and the server does not reboot.

Workaround None. (CSCta54895)

Symptom When a cluster configuration is set up such that I/O module 1 goes to fabric interconnect B and I/O module 2 goes to fabric interconnect A, then the Ethernet devices are given ports 1 and 0. However if the setup is straight, with I/O Module 1 connected to fabric interconnect A and I/O Module 2 to fabric interconnect B, then the devices are assigned ports 0 and 1.

Workaround Connect IOM1 to fabric-interconnect A, and IOM2 to fabric-interconnect B. (CSCtb35660)

Symptom Logon access is denied for user accounts where the password field was left blank during user account creation.

Workaround When creating a user account, ensure that a secure password for the account is specified. (CSCta21326)

Symptom When more than 10 Cisco UCS Manager GUI sessions are open at the same time with remote authentication for a long time (typically for a few hours), one of the Cisco UCS Manager GUI sessions may fail to re-authenticate. This causes the session that fails the re-authentication to close. The problem does not happen when local authentication is in use.

Workaround Re-login to the Cisco UCS Manager GUI session when it closes. (CSCtb05260)

Fabric Interconnect

Symptom Without pin group configuration, server interfaces are pinned to uplink interfaces of the fabric interconnect dynamically and the pinning is redistributed as uplink interfaces go up or down. In some situations, the distribution of server interfaces across uplink interfaces is not balanced. Potential impact is some uplinks are under utilized.

Workaround None. (CSCsv92356)

Symptom At bootup of the fabric interconnect, the following message will be displayed on the console: “The startup-config won't be used until the next reboot.”

Workaround None, just ignore the message. (CSCsx13134)

Symptom Console login is treating the admin and ADMIN account as the same. Console login name on the fabric interconnect is not case sensitive, so there is no differentiation between e.g. 'admin' and 'ADMIN'.

Workaround Implement usernames that are not case sensitive. (CSCsy15489)

Symptom Under high stress on the system with repeated port flapping and a default or native VLAN changing simultaneously, a process may cause the fabric interconnect to reload.

Workaround None. (CSCta09325)

Symptom The **show cdp neighbor**  command does not display information for CDP neighbors seen from the management interface, nor does it display the fabric interconnect CDP information corresponding to the management interface.

Workaround None. (CSCta25287)

Symptom With FM/DM version 5.0(0.295) and UCS 1.1 release, a security user defined in Cisco UCS Manager does not get displayed on FM/DM.

Workaround None. Verify user security from Cisco UCS Manager. (CSCte25876)

UCS Manager CLI

Symptom The UUID of the VM changes in VMware vCenter. After a VM restarts, the virtual machine node on the VM tab shows multiple instances of the same VM with one online and one offline.

Workaround After the VM retention period configured in the VM lifecycle policy has passed, Cisco UCS Manager deletes the offline instance automatically. (CSCtc86297)

Symptom If multiple vHBA initiators are configured in the same zone so that they are visible to each other and can login to each other, and storage multipathing is not configured with active and standby paths through the Cisco UCS fabric interconnects (There is only one path through the primary fabric interconnect), and the primary fabric interconnect is rebooted, the vHBA driver can be exposed to a situation in which two initiators can try to login to each other at the same time, and cause a host crash.

Workaround Do not configure multiple vHBA initiators in the same zone, to ensure that they are not visible to each other. (CSCte36784)

Symptom ESX Read and Write commands sent on a vHBA keep timing out and being aborted even if the target device is logged into the network. This can happen if the link flaps very fast from up to down to up and memory allocation for the link event fails. The vHBA driver misses the link down event and it does not re-login to the fabric interconnect. The fabric interconnect, however, has no login state for the vHBA and so drops all packets from the vHBA.

Workaround Disable and reenable the port on the UCS fabric interconnect that corresponds to the vHBA. (CSCte08092)

### Release 1.0(2)

### The following caveats were opened in UCS software release 1.0(2) and are still unresolved.

Adapters

Symptom If default adapter policies are used, windows OS can take a long time to boot due to non-ideal VHBA related settings.

Workaround Create an adapter policy with optimal values and use that in the service profile. (CSCtb99003)

BIOS

Symptom With various Local Disk Configurations, the LSI SAS Configuration Utility fails to launch while in BIOS.

Workaround The LSI SAS Controller Utility should not be used and all of the Local Disk Policy and Service Profile operations must be executed using UCSM.(CSCtc21336)

Symptom Disabling USB 2.0 is disabled through Advanced->USB, results in various artifacts on that particular page. Some devices may not show up as expected. This results in no functional degradation during POST.

Workaround Either do not disable USB 2.0 (we are currently are not aware of any need to disable it), or ignore the resulting artifacts in the BIOS setup. (CSCta21849)

Symptom When the memory mirroring configuration is destroyed by removing a DIMM, the BIOS will switch to the Performance mode, and will not log a message that mirroring was disabled.

Workaround Check the status of the memory mirroring in  **BIOS Setup->Advanced -> Memory Configuration -> Memory RAS and Performance Configuration**. (CSCsy54097)

Symptom When plugging or removing USB devices at **BIOS Setup -> Advanced -> USB**, the Setup Utility may hang.

Workaround Reboot the server. (CSCsz41907)

Fabric Interconnect

HTTP

Symptom HTTPD process crashed, with the following event log:

Process crashed. Core file 1253640662\_SAM\_ucs-6120-1-A\_httpd\_log.3114.tar.gz (SAM/Switch Core Dump) detected on fabric interconnect A.

Workaround None. (CSCtc13234)

Pinning

UCS Manager GUI

Symptom When more than 10 GUI sessions are open at the same time with remote authentication for a long time (typically for few hours), it has been observed that one of the GUI sessions fails to re-authenticate. This causes the session that fails re-authentication to close. Problem does not happen when local authentication is in use.

Workaround Re-login to the GUI session when it closes. (CSCtb05260)

Symptom When waking up from sleep, the UCS Manager GUI will detect an event sequencing error and display the error: “Event Sequencing is skewed” because the JRE doesn't have a sleep detection mechanism.

Workaround Always shut down the UCSM GUI before putting your computer to sleep. (CSCta94641)

Symptom Downloads may be slow if TFTP is used.

Workaround If TFTP performance is slow, use SCP or another protocol. (CSCtb45761)

### Release 1.0(1)

### The following caveats were opened in UCS software release 1.0(1e) and are still present.

AAA

Symptom Local user passwords can not contain “$” character.

Workaround Do not include the “$” character in local user passwords. (CSCsz44814)

Symptom When using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an LDAP provider, the FQDN is not resolved with DNS, and user authentication using the LDAP provider does not work.

Workaround Use an IP address instead of an FQDN when creating LDAP providers. (CSCta09972)

Symptom The IPMI user database in not backed up in the UCS Manager when you export a configuration backup.

Workaround After the configuration import is done, manually configure the IPMI user profile. (CSCta48483)

Adapters

Symptom When a service profile containing two vNICs and having failover enabled is applied to QLogic or Emulex CNAs, the failback timeout specified in the adapter policy for the second vNIC has no effect. The failback timeout specified in the adapter policy and applied to the first vNIC is applied to the whole adapter and is effective for both vNICs.

Workaround Specify the desired failback timeout in the adapter policy and apply to the first vNIC. (CSCsz68887)

Symptom When a DCBXP peer on a physical interface sends two different unique identifiers in the protocol data unit in the same session, a DCBXP process error disables the port.

Workaround Enter the following commands and then wait for a minute for the port to come up:

scope chassis `chassis-id`

scope server *server-id*

scope adapter *adapter-id*

scope ext-eth-if *ext-eth-if-id*

set adminstate reset-connectivity

commit-buffer

(CSCsx42435)

BIOS

Symptom When a blade server is powered on with a faulty DIMM, the BIOS POST detects the faulty DIMM and two SEL entries are sent to the BMC. One entry is logged for each DIMM.

Workaround Enter the BIOS setup and navigate to the Advanced > Memory Configuration menu to distinguish the faulty DIMM from its neighbor. (CSCsy97698)

Symptom  *Symptom*  Installing EFI Native SLES 11 is currently not supported in this release.

Workaround None. (CSCsz99666)

Symptom One vNIC defined in the UCS Manager service profile boot order results in two BIOS vNICs.

Workaround Avoid defining two different pxelinux.cfg/<MAC> files that have different boot/install instructions. When booted, both vNICs should execute the same PXE configuration. (CSCsz41107)

Fabric Interconnect

Symptom Without pin-group configuration, server interfaces are dynamically pinned to fabric interconnect uplink interfaces, and the pinning is redistributed as uplink interfaces go up or down. In some situations, the distribution of server interfaces across uplink interfaces is not even.

Workaround None. (CSCsv92356)

Symptom When a fabric interconnect boots, the “The startup-config won't be used until the next reboot” message appears on the console. Fabric interconnect configuration is controlled by the UCS Manager, so this message has no meaning on the fabric interconnect configuration and has no functional impact.

Workaround None. (CSCsx13134)

Symptom Console logon user names on the fabric interconnect are not case sensitive. For example, there is no differentiation between admin and ADMIN.

Workaround Use case insensitive user names. (CSCsy15489)

Symptom When the system is under high stress, with repeated port flapping (ports rapidly going up and down) and default (native) VLAN change, the FWM process may core and cause the fabric interconnect to reload.

Workaround None. (CSCta09325)

Symptom The  **show cdp neighbor** CLI command does not display information for CDP neighbors seen from the management interface, nor does it display the fabric interconnect CDP information corresponding to the management interface.

Workaround None. (CSCta25287)

Faults and Alerts

Symptom Even though there are no POST failures in the chassis, the UCS Manager sometimes displays the overall status of the chassis as POST-failure.

Workaround Check the chassis POST messages for errors, and if there are none, ignore the UCS Manager status message. (CSCsz01878)

Symptom In rare cases the UCS Manager reports the link absence fault between the fabric interconnect server port and the fabric extender during the internal inventory collection. The following is an example of such a fault:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Original Severity: Major

Previous Severity: Major

Highest Severity: Major

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Workaround Ignore the fault message; it will automatically get cleared after one minute. This will not impact the data path. (CSCta76573)

High Availability

Symptom After a full restore of the primary fabric interconnect, the subordinate fabric interconnect installation may temporarily fail with the following message:

Enter the admin password of the peer switch:

 Connecting to peer switch... unable to connect! Password could be wrong.

 Hit enter to try again or type 'restart' to start setup from beginning...

Workaround Retry the fabric interconnect installation. (CSCsz85876)

Inventory

Symptom Hardware revision numbers for fabric interconnect components are not populated in the UCS Manager.

Workaround Perform the following steps to determine the revision number for a fabric interconnect component:

 **1.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enter the **connect nxos** command to connect to the native NX-OS CLI.

 **2.**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enter the appropriate  **show sprom**  *component* command and look for  **H/W Version:** field in the command output. (CSCta12005)

Symptom All DIMMs are reported to be in array 1, and maximum memory for a blade is reported as 192-GB.

Workaround DIMMs may be physically located in array 1 or array 2, and the maximum memory is 96-GB. This is a display-only issue, and does not affect functionality. (CSCta56527)

Pinning

Symptom In the UCS Manager GUI, you can only select port channels and individual uplink ports as pin targets, but the UCS Manager CLI allows you to also select port channel member ports as pin targets.

Workaround Port channel member ports should not be selected as pin targets, even if the UCS Manager CLI allows you to. (CSCta60495)

Server

Symptom Local disk removal and insertion is not detected.

Workaround Select the  **Re-Acknowledge Server** option in UCS Manager GUI to discover the server. (CSCsy80888)

Symptom The disk scrub policy needs enhancements to meet DOD compliance.

Workaround None. (CSCsy20036)

SNMP

Symptom SNMP shows the fabric interconnect name rather than system name.

Workaround None. (CSCta22029)

Symptom An SNMP user name can not be the same as a local user name.

Workaround Select an SNMP user name that does not match any local user name. (CSCta24034)

SMASH

Symptom Any SMASH command entered with wrong option should give “INVALID OPTION” error message.

Workaround None. (CSCsv87256)

UCS Manager CLI

Symptom Statistics counters cannot be cleared using the UCS Manager CLI.

Workaround Clear the counters using the UCS Manager GUI. (CSCsz47512)

UCS Manager GUI

Symptom When several KVM Consoles are launched, the SUN JRE sometimes reports an error and the KVM Console fails to launch.

Workaround Launch the KVM Console again. (CSCta38463)

Symptom In the UCS Manager GUI, if the  **Reboot on boot Order Change** checkbox is checked for a boot policy, and if CD-ROM or Floppy is the last device in the boot order, then deleting or adding the device does not directly affect the boot order and the server does not reboot.

Workaround None. (CSCta54895)

Symptom Fibre Channel port and server port events do not appear on the Fibre Channel port and server port  **Events** tabs.

Workaround Look on the Admin  **Events** tab for Fibre Channel port and server port events. (CSCta66375)

## New Hardware Features in Release 1.4

### Release1.4(3y) adds support for:

* Version 2 of UCS B440 M1 and M2 Blade Servers. This new hardware version is part of a proactive replacement program. See  [Field Notice 63430](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/ts/fn/634/fn63430.html) for further details.

### Release 1.4(3) adds support for:

* B440 M2 servers using Westmere EX processors
* B230 M2 servers using Westmere EX processors

### Release 1.4(2) adds support for:

* 7-m and 10-m 10G SFP+ Twinax active cable assemblies

### Release 1.4(1) adds support for:

* UCS B230 server blade

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) UCS Manager now supports the newest blade in the UCS B Series, the UCS B230 which is a 2 socket, 32 DIMM slot half width server with two optional SSDs.

* UCS Manager support for UCS C-Series

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The UCS C200, C210 and C250 servers can now be managed directly from UCS Manager. Integration details are available in the  [C-series server installation guides](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10493/prod_installation_guides_list.html). Contact your Cisco representative for additional information on connectivity and compatibility requirements.

* Fabric Extender Transceiver (FET-10G) between the fabric interconnect and fabric extender.
* 16GB DIMMs (A02-M316GB2-L=) are now qualified on the B200M2 server model when using UCS version 1.4(1i) and UCS capability catalog ucs-catalog.1.0.16.T.bin or greater (this catalog is available separately and included in the version 1.4(1i) software bundle).
* 16GB DIMM pairs (A02-M332GB3-2-L=) are now qualified on the B440M1 server model when using UCS version 1.4(1m). To support new power budget information for the B440 server and updated power numbers for 16GB DIMMs, UCS capability catalog ucs-catalog.1.0.25.T.bin (only available as a standalone download or as part of the UCS version 1.4(1m) bundle) or greater will need to be imported into UCS. The UCS hardware catalog has been modified to increase the B440 system board base power, and increase the power budget for 16GB DIMMs. These values are used to calculate the default Chassis Level Power Cap for the B440 blade with 16GB DIMMs.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)

---

**Caution**
![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Without this catalog update, the calculated default Chassis Power budget may be lower than needed. Certain large configurations (including 16GB DIMMs) of the B440 server, under maximum load, may trigger throttling of the processor with the lower default power budget. If unwanted throttling occurs, a re-acknowledgement of the chassis may be required to include the higher system board base power from the updated catalog, and prevent throttling of the processors. If throttling occurs on a server, an informational fault will be raised in the server faults tab. The fault message is “P-state lowered as consumption hit power cap”.

---

## New Software Features in Release 1.4

### Release 1.4(3u) adds support for:

* A user label was added to the KVM window.

### Release 1.4(3q) adds support for:

* The maximum number of VLAN Port instances is now 14,000.

### Release 1.4(2) adds support for:

* Chassis renumbering
* LACP support on an appliance port

### Release 1.4(1) adds support for:

* Chassis and multi-chassis power capping for UCS B-Series

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Power capping has been extended to cover chassis and groups of chassis and includes a policy based workflow using service profiles for setting it up.

* Software packaging with server bundles

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Support for server and adapter hardware can now be delivered independent of support for the infrastructure components. This allows customers to add support for new server types without having to upgrade their Fabric Interconnect or UCS Manager software.

* Scalability

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) UCS instances now scale to up to 20 UCS 5108 chassis.

Ethernet and Fibre Channel

* FabricSync

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The UCS 6100 synchronizes their mac-addresses between them. It works along with FabricFailover feature to provide faster VNIC fail over for Bare metal and brings HA to Hyper-V virtual switch networks. It is always turned on.

* PVLAN support

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Layer 2 traffic segmentation within a subnet can now be achieved using PVLAN Isolated access in the UCSM. This allows customer to achieve vNIC level isolation which translates to VM level isolation using Cisco Virtual interface card in pass though mode.

* SPAN support on UCS 6100

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) SPAN provides granular visibility in to the Ethernet and FibreChannel flows within UCSM for monitoring and troubleshooting.

* Higher VLAN scalability (>1000)

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Increased VLAN scalability from 512 in 1.3(1) to 1024 in 1.4(1)

* Direct connect Appliance

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Specialized IP Appliances such NAS filers and ISCSI storage can be connected directly to the UCS 6100 in End Host mode. This allows reduction in number of hops and latency for communication between server and IP storage.

* FC Trunking and port channel (in NPV mode)

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Allows trunking of multiple VSANs using a single FC link and FibreChannel link consolidation when using VSANs,

* Limited Direct Connect FC Storage

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) FibreChannel storage can now be directly connected to the UCS 6100 with default zone policy (No zone configuration allowed in the 6100 but can be inherited from an upstream MDS switch).

Security

* KVM security enhancements

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Multi-user KVM access has new controls that allow the first user to allow/deny or control the permissions of subsequent sessions.

* AAA - Active Directory group support

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Groups defined in active directory can now be mapped into roles within UCS Manager.

* AAA - Multi-authentication support

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) UCS Manager now supports concurrent authentication using different authentication schemes such as Active Directory, TACACS+ or RADIUS. Concurrent authentication with multiple instances of the same scheme, such as multiple Active Directory domains, is also supported.

Monitoring

* SNMP GET support for all UCS components

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) SNMP support has been extended to provide query (GET) support for all UCS components. The new MIB files can be accessed at  <http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/netmgmt/cmtk/mibs.shtml>. Select UCS Manager under 'Unified Computing'.

* UCS 6100 licensing enforcement/warnings

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A new GUI based workflow for licensing management is available and licenses are enforced with warning messages.

* Syslog message classification enhancements

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) New UCS labels allow easier filtering of syslog messages.

Stateless Computing

* Scheduling of service profile changes

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Through the use of maintenance policies, service profile deployments can be scheduled for a later time. In addition, the number of concurrent profiles that are being applied and the total number of profiles applied during a particular time window can be controlled.

* Impact analysis of configuration changes

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A simple “pre-flight check” compatibility check allows customers to recognize potential compatibility issues before applying a service profile to a particular server.

* CIMC IP address abstraction

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) In addition to the CIMC IP address for the CIMC on the server an optional management IP is available with the service profile that can move with the service profile when it is moved to a new server.

Usability

* User labels for managed objects

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Service profiles, servers and chassis have custom user labels that can be applied. These user labels can be displayed, sorted and filtered through the UCS Manager GUI.

* Direct upload of firmware image files from UCSM client

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The need for setting up SCP/SFTP for image file uploads is now optional since a direct upload from the laptop or other UCS Manager client to UCS Manager is now possible.
