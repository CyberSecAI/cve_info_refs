Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Excel handles memory when opening specially crafted Excel files. Specifically, a heap overflow occurs when parsing the SerAuxErrBar data structure within an Excel file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow vulnerability in Microsoft Excel
- Improper handling of memory when parsing specially crafted Excel files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the same privileges as the current user.
- Full system control: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- Ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email Attachments: An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file to a user, convincing them to open it.
- Web-based Attacks: An attacker hosts a malicious Excel file on a website, convincing users to visit the site and open the file.
- Compromised Websites: Websites that accept user-generated content or advertisements could also host malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Excel file.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to a target system, either through email, a website, or compromised site
- Ability to convince the user to open the malicious excel file.
