- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The RazorCMS application lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions such as deleting web pages, both published and unpublished, without their knowledge or consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted by the victim's browser, sends a request to the vulnerable application. The vulnerable application then interprets this as a legitimate request due to the victim's active session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page controlled by the attacker. The attacker does not need any privileged access to the system, only the knowledge of the vulnerable application and the request parameters.
