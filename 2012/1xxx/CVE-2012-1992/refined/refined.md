- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization of the "email" parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Email Address" field, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a malicious payload in the "email" parameter via an HTTP POST request to the `admin/edituser.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the "Email Address" field within the "Edit User" template, which likely requires administrative or user-level access to the CMS.
