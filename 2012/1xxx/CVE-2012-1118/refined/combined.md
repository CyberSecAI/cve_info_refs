How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Summary | 0010124: Bug in access\_has\_bug\_level | | | | |
| Description | There's a heavy problem in the access\_has\_bug\_level function giving access to everyone.  By setting the private\_bug\_view\_threshold via the project configuration to an array (and not only a number)  eg.  if you have 0 0 X 0 X X in the configuration, this will result in an Array, instead of 0 0 X X X X resulting in a number in the mantis\_config\_table.  This leads to a misfunction in access\_api.php/function access\_has\_bug\_level:  The code there: If the bug is private and the user is not the reporter, then thethe user must also have higher access than private\_bug\_threshold if ( VS\_PRIVATE == bug\_get\_field( $p\_bug\_id, 'view\_state' ) && !bug\_is\_user\_reporter( $p\_bug\_id, $p\_user\_id ) ) { $p\_access\_level = max( $p\_access\_level, config\_get( 'private\_bug\_threshold' ) ); }  So, the parameter of the max-Funktion are an access\_level, e.g. MANAGER and an array with the private\_bug\_threshold from the database.  The result: Because the max-Function can't handle this integer/array-mixture, the returned value is empty, so everyone has access to the bug. | | | | |

#### Activities

| [Zonix](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=19150)   [Zonix](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=19150)  2012-01-23 08:08  reporter    [~0031005](view.php?id=10124#c31005 "Direct link to note") | Just stumbled on this as well in 1.2.8:  We have a strong policy that nobody should be allowed to delete issues, thus I set delete\_bug\_threshold = NOBODY. Private bugs are accessible for certain roles only, so I configured  private\_bug\_threshold = array ( 0 => 40, 1 => 42, 2 => 55, 3 => 60, 4 => 65, 5 => 90, )  with the configuration pages. The result is that anyone can actually delete private bugs (delete button on bug view page).  I consider this a major bug since the security scheme for private bugs can be accidently broken by an administrator who configures the private\_bug\_threshold individually for access roles.  Could anyone take care of this issue?  BTW, category "authentication" should be changed to "security" since this problem is not only related to authentication. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Fix bug in access\_has\_bug\_level() for private issues

```
When private_bug_threshold is defined as an array instead of a single
access level, e.g. array(0=>40, 1=>70, 2=>90) to prevent developers
from seeing private bugs while granting that privilege to updaters,
access_has_bug_level() incorrectly returned true.

The consequence is that unwanted access to Private bugs was granted to
users who are allowed to view them, e.g. allowing them to delete or
perform other restricted actions.

Fixes #10124

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
