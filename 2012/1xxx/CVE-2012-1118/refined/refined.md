{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `access_has_bug_level` function in MantisBT incorrectly handles the `private_bug_threshold` configuration option when it's set to an array instead of an integer value.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is due to a type confusion within the `access_has_bug_level` function. It expects an integer representing an access level but fails to properly handle the case where the `private_bug_threshold` configuration is set to an array of access levels. This allows bypassing access checks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation allows unauthorized users to bypass access checks designed to restrict access to private bugs. This could lead to unauthorized viewing, modification, or deletion of private bug reports and attachments, and in general access to any restricted feature",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by configuring the `private_bug_threshold` option to an array of access levels. A malicious actor does not need to be a logged in user if they know this setting is present.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs no special position or capabilities other than to recognize the existence of the vulnerable software and the array based threshold. An attacker would not need specific access permissions but would need to know or test for this specific configuration option."
