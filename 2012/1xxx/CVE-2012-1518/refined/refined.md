- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect access control list (ACL) settings on the VMware Tools folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect folder permissions leading to privilege escalation on Windows guest operating systems.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation on Windows-based guest operating systems. An attacker with local access to a vulnerable guest OS can gain elevated privileges by exploiting the incorrect folder permissions.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to a vulnerable Windows-based guest operating system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access to a vulnerable Windows guest operating system.
