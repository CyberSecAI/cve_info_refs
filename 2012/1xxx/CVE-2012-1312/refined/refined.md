Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the Cisco IOS Software's Measurement, Aggregation, and Correlation Engine (MACE) feature. Specifically, it is triggered when processing transit traffic through a router configured with MACE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability is present in the MACE feature.
- The vulnerability allows for memory leaks or device reloads due to improper handling of network traffic within the MACE feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a router reloading, resulting in a denial of service.
- Repeated exploits could lead to a sustained denial-of-service condition.
- The vulnerability may cause the router to leak memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated.
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending transit traffic through a router that has the MACE feature enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic that transits through a Cisco router with MACE enabled.
- The attacker does not need any special capabilities other than being able to send network traffic to a vulnerable device.
