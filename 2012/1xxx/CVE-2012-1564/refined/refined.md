Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `administration/create_album.php` file of the YVS Image Gallery software. This file lacks proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input validation in `create_album.php` allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the album creation process. These scripts are then stored in the application's database and executed when users view the albums.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XSS Execution:** When an administrator creates an album with malicious script, the injected script will be executed when a user views the album.
- **User Compromise:** This can lead to various consequences, including session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and potentially further compromise of user accounts or the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `administration/create_album.php` interface.
- An attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to create albums.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the `create_album.php` functionality and create new albums.
-   **Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to craft the malicious input that contains the XSS payload.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specifically a stored XSS vulnerability.
- The impact is not limited to administrators, as normal users viewing the album are also affected.
- The provided context indicates that other vulnerabilities exist in the application, such as a PHP code injection vulnerability in `install.php`, which is assigned a separate CVE.
