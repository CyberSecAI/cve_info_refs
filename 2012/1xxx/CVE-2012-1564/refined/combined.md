Subject: Case YVS Image Gallery

<http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/79477>

The software "YVS Image Gallery" seems to be full of security issues. For example one can have lots of fun with this. Copy from installation.php:

"""
    case(isset($_POST['db_name'])):

        $host = $_POST['host'];
        $db_name = $_POST['db_name'];
        $db_user_name = $_POST['db_user_name'];
        $db_password = $_POST['db_password'];

        $admin_name = $_POST['admin_name'];
        $admin_password = $_POST['admin_password'];

        $o_host = $_POST['o_host'];
        $o_db_name = $_POST['o_db_name'];
        $o_db_user_name = $_POST['o_db_user_name'];
        $o_db_password = $_POST['o_db_password'];

        //read in the file
        $file = "../functions/db_connect.php";
        $fh = fopen($file, 'r+');
        $contents = fread($fh, filesize($file));

        //set up the text to change
        $text_to_change = array();
        $new_text = array();

        $text_to_change[] = '$dbhost="'.$o_host.'"';
        $text_to_change[] = '$dbuser="'.$o_db_user_name.'"';
        $text_to_change[] = '$dbpass="'.$o_db_password.'"';
        $text_to_change[] = '$dbname="'.$o_db_name.'"';

        $new_text[] = '$dbhost="'.$host.'"';
        $new_text[] = '$dbuser="'.$db_user_name.'"';
        $new_text[] = '$dbpass="'.$db_password.'"';
        $new_text[] = '$dbname="'.$db_name.'"';

        $new_contents = str_replace($text_to_change, $new_text, $contents);
        fclose($fh);

        // Open file to write
        $fh = fopen($file, 'r+');
        fwrite($fh, $new_contents);
        fclose($fh);

        //set up new admin user

        include '../functions/db_connect.php';

        db_connect();
"""

I'll bet this software is not used much, but I can list all problems I can find if we want to assign CVE-identifiers to cases like these. No contact information of developer found. Any ideas how to get these fixed or get the code out of internet. The package is also hosted in here: <http://www.hotscripts.com/listing/yvs-image-gallery/> (and probably others).

Never heard back, for now I'm going to go with the "it's documented,
therefore it's not a bug but a config issue"

Please use CVE-2012-1564 for the XSS in administration/create_album.php
issue.

1. ./administration/install.php opens ../functions/db_connect.php and writes to file without input validation leading to PHP code injection with all variables if any contains for example: ";} ?> <?php print("Hello World"); exit("") ?>

Note that install guide in web says: "after instalation is complete, delete the "install.php" file" and install.php does not need permissions.

2. ./administration/create_album.php does not have proper input validation leading to stored XSS, which can only be added by administrators, but I don't think this as a limit after other vulnerabilities. XSS will also be shown to normal users (mainpage).

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
