## Insecure Library Loading Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Published: August 23, 2010 | Updated: May 13, 2014

**Version:** 19.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

Microsoft is aware that research has been published detailing a remote attack vector for a class of vulnerabilities that affects how applications load external libraries.

This issue is caused by specific insecure programming practices that allow so-called "binary planting" or "DLL preloading attacks". These practices could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the vulnerable application when the user opens a file from an untrusted location.

This issue is caused by applications passing an insufficiently qualified path when loading an external library. Microsoft has issued guidance to developers in the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712), on how to correctly use the available application programming interfaces to prevent this class of vulnerability. Microsoft is also actively reaching out to third-party vendors through the Microsoft Vulnerability Research Program to inform them of the mitigations available in the operating system. Microsoft is also actively investigating which of its own applications may be affected.

In addition to this guidance, Microsoft is releasing a tool that allows system administrators to mitigate the risk of this new attack vector by altering the library loading behavior system-wide or for specific applications. This advisory describes the functionality of this tool and other actions that customers can take to help protect their systems.

**Mitigating Factors**:

* This issue only affects applications that do not load external libraries securely. Microsoft has previously published guidelines for developers in the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712), that recommend alternate methods to load libraries that are safe against these attacks.
* For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a document from this location that is then loaded by a vulnerable application.
* The file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the possible attack vectors for this vulnerability.

## Affected Software

Microsoft is investigating whether any of its own applications are affected by insecure library loading vulnerabilities and will take appropriate action to protect its customers.

## Advisory FAQ

**Where can developers find guidance on how to avoid this issue?**

As of June 14, 2011, the update in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2533623) implements Application Programming Interface (API) enhancements in Windows to help developers correctly and securely load external libraries. Developers should follow the guidance provided in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2533623) to take advantage of the API enhancements provided by the update.

Microsoft has also published the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712), which describes the various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) available on Windows that allow developers to correctly and securely load external libraries.

Microsoft is working with developers through the Microsoft Vulnerability Research Program to share information with them on how to prevent this vulnerability in their products. Software vendors and ISVs that have questions on the mitigations available in Windows for this issue are invited to contact for additional mitigation information.

**What is the scope of the issue?**

Microsoft is aware of research published by a number of security researchers that describes a new remote attack vector for this known class of vulnerabilities. Applications are affected when they insufficiently qualify the path of an external library.

**What causes this threat?**

This exploit may occur when applications do not directly specify the fully qualified path to a library it intends to load. Depending on how the application is developed, Windows, instructed by the application, will search specific locations in the file system for the necessary library, and will load the file if found.

Some Application Programming Interfaces (API), such as SearchPath, use a search order that is intended for documents and not application libraries. Applications that use this API may try to load the library from the Current Working Directory (CWD), which may be controlled by an attacker. Other APIs may also lead to similar behavior, when used in specific ways described in the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712).

In the case of network shares, such as WebDAV or SMB, an attacker who can write to this location could upload a specially crafted library. In this scenario, the application attempts to load the specially crafted library, which can then execute arbitrary code on the client system in the security context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In some cases, an attacker who already has access to a local folder on the system could use a DLL preloading vulnerability in a local application running with elevated privileges to elevate his access to the system.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that the attacker convince the user to open a file using a vulnerable program, from a remote network location. When the application loads one of its required or optional libraries, the vulnerable application may attempt to load the library from the remote network location. If the attacker provides a specially crafted library at this location, the attacker may succeed at executing arbitrary code on the user's machine.

**What are the remote attack vectors for this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability can be exploited over network file systems such as (but not limited to) WebDAV and SMB. An attacker can offer a file for download over any such protocol. If the application used to open this file does not load external libraries securely, the user opening that file could be exposed to this vulnerability.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

This vulnerability may require third-party vendors to issue a security update for their respective affected applications. As part of this security advisory, Microsoft is releasing an optional mitigation tool that helps customers address the risk of the remote attack vector through a per-application and global configuration setting.

Microsoft is also investigating whether any of its own applications are affected by DLL preloading vulnerabilities and will take appropriate action to protect its customers.

**What is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL)?**

A DLL is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time. For example, in Windows operating systems, the Comdlg32 DLL performs common dialog box related functions. Therefore, each program can use the functionality that is contained in this DLL to implement an Open dialog box. This helps promote code reuse and efficient memory usage.

By using a DLL, a program can be modularized into separate components. For example, an accounting program may be sold by module. Each module can be loaded into the main program at run time if that module is installed. Because the modules are separate, the load time of the program is faster, and a module is only loaded when that functionality is requested.

**What is Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)?**

Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) extends the HTTP/1.1 protocol to allow clients to publish, lock, and manage resources on the Web. Integrated into IIS, WebDAV allows clients to do the following:

* Manipulate resources in a WebDAV publishing directory on your server. For example, users who have been assigned the correct rights can copy and move files around in a WebDAV directory.
* Modify properties associated with certain resources. For example, a user can write to and retrieve a file's property information.
* Lock and unlock resources so that multiple users can read a file concurrently.
* Search the content and properties of files in a WebDAV directory.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol?**

Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol is a Microsoft network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows. For more information on SMB, see MSDN article, [Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa365233).

## Suggested Actions

* **Apply the update for affected software**

  Refer to the section, **Updates relating to Insecure Library Loading**, for available updates.
* **Apply Workarounds**

  Workarounds refer to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available. See the next section, **Workarounds**, for more information.

### Workarounds

* **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

  Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.

  \*\* \*\*
* **Disable the WebClient service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

### Additional Suggested Actions

* **Install updates from third-party vendors that address insecure library loading**

  Third-party vendors may release updates that address insecure library loading in their products. Microsoft recommends that customers contact their vendor if they have any questions whether or not a specific application is affected by this issue, and monitor for security updates released by these vendors.
* **Protect your PC**

  We continue to encourage customers to follow our Protect Your Computer guidance of enabling a firewall, getting software updates and installing antivirus software. For more information, see [Microsoft Safety & Security Center](https://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx).
* **Keep Microsoft Software Updated**

  Users running Microsoft software should apply the latest Microsoft security updates to help make sure that their computers are as protected as possible. If you are not sure whether your software is up to date, visit [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747), scan your computer for available updates, and install any high-priority updates that are offered to you. If you have automatic updating enabled and configured to provide updates for Microsoft products, the updates are delivered to you when they are released, but you should verify that they are installed.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-046 - Important

## Vulnerability in Visual Basic for Applications Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2707960)

Published: July 10, 2012 | Updated: November 13, 2012

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a legitimate Microsoft Office file (such as a .docx file) that is located in the same directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts that have full user rights. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported versions of Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications SDK and third-party applications that use Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. This security update is also rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2003 SP3, Microsoft Office 2007 SP2, and Microsoft Office 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications loads external libraries. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2707960](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2707960) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to replace the KB2598361 update with the KB2687626 update for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 to address an issue involving specific digital certificates that were generated by Microsoft without proper timestamp attributes. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2749655](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2749655).

Although the rereleased update (KB2687626) replaces the original update (KB2598361) for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3, customers who have successfully installed the KB2598361 update do not need to install the KB2687626 update.

**I have already successfully installed the original KB2598361** **update for Microsoft Office 2003. Do I need to apply the rereleased update package (KB2687626) released on** **November 13, 2012?**

No. The rereleased update (KB2687626) only applies to systems running Microsoft Office 2003 on which the original update (KB2598361) has not been installed. Customers who have already successfully installed the original KB2598361 update for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 do not need to take any action. In addition, customers will not be offered the rereleased update (KB2687626) if the original update (KB2598361) is already installed on their systems.

**Note** In the case where the KB2598361 update is already installed, and then the KB2687626 update is installed on the same system, the installer generates a message that the update is already installed. After the message is generated, the KB2687626 update will replace the KB2598361 update in the list of installed updates. For more information about this installation behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2707960](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2707960).

**Is this update related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**

Yes, the Visual Basic for Applications Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1854) addressed by this update is related to the class of vulnerabilities, described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2269637), that affects how applications load external libraries. This security update addresses a particular instance of this type of vulnerability.

**The update is to a shared component used by Microsoft Office. Will the update be offered to Microsoft Office software that includes the shared component, even if the software does not access the vulnerable code?**

Yes, the update will be offered to systems where the vulnerable shared Office component is detected. This is true even for cases where the Office software includes VBE6.dll but does not access the vulnerable code.

**Why are multiple package updates available for Microsoft Office 2010 and Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 1?**

The updates required to address the vulnerability described in this bulletin are offered across different package updates as indicated in the **Affected Software** table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft Office 2010.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Where** **are the hashes of the security** **updates?**

The SHA1 and SHA2 hashes of the security updates can be used to verify the authenticity of downloaded security update packages. For the hash information pertaining to this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2707960](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2707960).

**I have applied the required Microsoft security updates, but I still have an affected version of the Visual Basic for Applications runtime (VBE6.dll) on my system. How do I update this DLL?**

There are cases where your system might still have an affected version of VBE6.dll even after you have installed the required security updates for Microsoft Office and the update for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications listed in this bulletin.

If VBE6.dll was installed on your system by a supported version of Microsoft Office, then applying the security update for the affected version of Microsoft Office will replace VBE6.dll with the updated version that addresses the vulnerability described in this bulletin. However, if VBE6.dll was installed on your system by a third-party application, you may have to install an update for that program.

To update VBE6.dll for third-party applications there are two possible scenarios depending on the third-party application's implementation of VBA. If you know that the third-party application is compliant to the recommended best practices for using a shared component as a side-by-side assembly, then applying the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (KB2688865) update will replace VBE6.dll in the shared location with the updated version that addresses the vulnerability described in this bulletin.

On the other hand, if the third-party application does not put VBE6.dll in the shared location as per recommended best practices, then you should contact the third-party application developer and ask them to provide you with an updated version of their application that contains a newer version of the VBE6.dll that addresses the vulnerability described in this bulletin.

**This security update only applies to Microsoft software. How can I detect if third-party applications have deployed an affected version of the Visual Basic for Applications runtime (VBE6.dll) on my system?**

Third-party applications that support VBA could deploy VBE6.dll in a location that is not updated by this security update. In the case that you do have a third-party application that has shipped with its own copy of VBE6.dll, to help ensure that your system is fully protected from the vulnerability described in this bulletin, you should contact the developer or vendor responsible for support for the third-party application directly.

For details on how to scan for copies of VBE6.dll on your system, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 978213](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/978213). Scanning for all copies of VBE6.dll on your system can assist in identifying potentially vulnerable copies that may have been installed by third-party applications.

**I am a third-party** **softwaredeveloper and I use Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications runtime in my application. Is my application vulnerable and how do I update it?**

Developers who redistribute the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications runtime VBE6.dll should download an updated version of the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications SDK from the [Summit Software Company](https://www.summsoft.com/). Then, update the application installer with the updated VBA runtime. For more information on best practices on redistributed component use, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 835322](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/835322) and the MSDN article, [Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa375193.aspx).

**I am an ISV. Where is the update for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications SDK?**

The update is available from the [Summit Software Company](https://www.summsoft.com/). Summit Software Company is a global supplier of application customization software products and integration support services to independent software vendors (ISVs) and corporate developers. In June 1996, Summit Software entered into an agreement with Microsoft to sell Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications and related value-added technology and services. Summit continues to sell and support Microsoft VBA.

**How** **areMicrosoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerability?**

A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Excel is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Excel that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

## Visual Basic for Applications Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1854

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1854](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1854).

#### Mitigating Factors for Visual Basic for Applications Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1854

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
* For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate Office-related file (such as a .docx file).
* Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Visual Basic for Applications Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1854

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

  Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block the loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
* **Disable the** **WebClient** **service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround, remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability may cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN). However, users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. The following is a list of some of the applications or services that could be impacted:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for Visual Basic for Applications Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1854

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications incorrectly restricts the path used for loading external libraries.

**What is Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)?**

Microsoft VBA is a development technology for developing client desktop packaged applications and integrating them with existing data and systems. Microsoft VBA is based on the Microsoft Visual Basic development system. Microsoft Office products include VBA and use VBA to perform certain functions. VBA can also be used to build customized applications based around an existing host application.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate Microsoft Office-related file (such as a .docx file) that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Microsoft Office could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a legitimate Microsoft Office-related file (such as a .docx file) to a user, and convincing the user to put the attachment into a directory that contains a specially crafted DLL file and to open the legitimate file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Microsoft Office could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In a network attack scenario, an attacker could put a legitimate Microsoft Office-related file and a specially crafted DLL file in a network share, a UNC, or WebDAV location and then convince the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Office is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications loads external libraries.

**Is this vulnerability related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**

Yes. This vulnerability is related to the class of vulnerabilities described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2269637), which affects how applications load external libraries.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
