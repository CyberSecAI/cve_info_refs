  "CVE-2012-1893": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly validates parameters when creating a hook procedure. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly validates parameters when creating a hook procedure.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of parameters when creating a hook procedure."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local logon to the system is required, followed by running a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Valid logon credentials",
       "Ability to log on locally to the system",
       "Ability to run a specially crafted application"
    ]
