{
  "CVE-2012-1986": {
    "description": "When handling requests for a file from a remote filebucket, puppet can be tricked into overwriting its defined location for filebucket storage. This allows an authorized attacker with access to the puppet master to read arbitrary files.",
    "root_cause": "Puppet incorrectly handles filebucket retrieval requests, allowing overwriting the filebucket storage location.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure file handling",
      "Path traversal/overwrite"
    ],
    "impact": "An authorized attacker with access to the puppet master can read arbitrary files on the system by controlling the filebucket storage location.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating filebucket retrieval requests"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires authorization and access to the puppet master."
