| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-06-03 08:34:52 UTC  ``` Security researcher Adam Barth found that inline event handlers, such as onclick, were no longer blocked by Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected.   Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-36.html> <http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c1)  Murray McAllister    2012-06-05 03:26:47 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-05 20:59:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0710 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0710.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-06 23:51:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0715 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0715.html>   ``` |  |

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0710)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2011-3101, CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939,
CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
Firefox no longer blocked Firefox inline event handlers. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to possibly bypass a web application's intended
restrictions, if that application relied on CSP to protect against flaws
such as cross-site scripting (XSS). (CVE-2012-1944)

If a web server hosted HTML files that are stored on a Microsoft Windows
share, or a Samba share, loading such files with Firefox could result in
Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
HTML files from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.5 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ken Russell of Google as the original reporter of
CVE-2011-3101; Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman
as the original reporters of CVE-2012-1937; Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov,
Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy as the
original reporters of CVE-2012-1938; Christian Holler as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-1939; security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google as
the original reporter of CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, and CVE-2012-1947;
security researcher Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1946; security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1944; and security researcher Paul Stone as the original reporter
of CVE-2012-1945.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

So, here's an analysis of what happens here. The element which gets destroyed before being removed from the doc is the inline table editing UI. We destroy these elements in a very gross way (see [bug 439258](/show_bug.cgi?id=439258 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - \"ASSERTION: anonymous nodes should not be in child lists\"")), explicitly from nsHTMLEditor::~nsHTMLEditor. In order to destroy these elements, we need the root element (mRootElement) which serves as the parent for these elements, but that gets cleared in nsPlaintextEditor::PreDestroy, which results us to fail to destroy these elements properly, so they will remain in the document.
This is pretty bad, but not as bad as what it seems like at first. These are native anonymous elements, so the web content cannot directly access them. But still this may be used in addition to other stuff to come up with an exploit. So, I think sg:crit is the right classification.
This has been broken since the inception of table/abs-pos editing UI, and infects all versions of Gecko. We should also consider this if we decide to ship another 1.9.2 version.blocking1.9.2: --- → ?

[Triage Comment]
We discussed this in today's channel meeting. We're at the point in this release where we're only taking fixes that have some probability of being a major issue over the next 6 weeks. We feel that the probability here is low enough that we'd like to take this first in FF13. Approved for Aurora.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2488-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Thijs Kinkhorst
June 7, 2012                           <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1937 CVE-2012-1940 CVE-2012-1947

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web
browser based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides
rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.

CVE-2012-1937

  Mozilla developers discovered several memory corruption bugs,
  which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1940

  Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem when working
  with column layout with absolute positioning in a container that
  changes size, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1947

  Abhishek Arya discovered a heap buffer overflow in utf16 to latin1
  character set conersion, allowing to execute arbitray code.

Note: We'd like to advise users of Iceweasel's 3.5 branch in Debian
stable to consider to upgrade to the Iceweasel 10.0 ESR (Extended
Support Release) which is now availble in Debian Backports.
Although Debian will continue to support Iceweasel 3.5 in stable with
security updates, this can only be done on a best effort base as
upstream provides no such support anymore. On top of that, the 10.0
branch adds proactive security features to the browser.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.16-16.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.5esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:13.0/ rv:10.0.5)

Announced
June 5, 2012
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 13
* Firefox ESR 10.0.5
* SeaMonkey 2.10
* Thunderbird 13
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.5

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk
in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

It's quite possible for data to be transferred but not rendered (e.g. when stream converters of any sort, including the unknown decoder, are involved).
The security UI code will treat data being transferred as a signal to update security state.
This means it's possible to leave the browser rendering page A while the security UI shows the state for page B. This is obviously bad.
[Bug 714631](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content") had a specific instance of this that I papered over, but this is a general problem that needs fixing. If we need to expose more information from docshell or necko or the DOM to the security UI, we should just do that as needed!

We're releasing a fix (and advisory) for [bug 714631](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content") in Firefox 12, and Chrome fixed a similar problem in Chrome 16 (with blog from the reporter). There could be renewed interest in playing with this kind of attack so we really should let this go unaddressed.Assignee: nobody → honzab.moz

I'll start working on this on Monday.

I wanted to do some changes, but this bug needs a quick fix.
We may start some discussion on what we should change (not in this bug). There are bugs, secure browser UI should be radically rewritten - that was what I wanted to do.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

(In reply to Jeroen van der Gun from [Bug 714631 comment #30](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c30 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content"))

My test:
- I'm at e.g. www.janbambas.cz (non-https)
- I enter <https://mylocalhttpsserver/the-test-attachment.atom> at the address bar(my local server where I host the attachment with '.atom' extension)
=> larry then shows blue UI, janbambas.cz and expanding it shows "you are connected to janbambas.cz, Verified by: my test CA" (that is my own test CA of my local server's cert)
The patch for [bug 714631](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content") doesn't fix that.

Just a tech summary:
- we load the .atom file
- content type is application/vnd.mozilla.maybe.feed
- we find FeedConverter able to convert the data to any type
- this may lead to display of the feed content on the screen, so this load is not considered a download (no LOAD\_RETARGETED\_DOCUMENT\_URI flag set that would prevent security state update)
- the feed has a corrupted content that cannot be displayed
- feed converter then opens a new channel to the same URI at [1]
- content type is application/atom+xml this time
- no converter or handler found -> download the feed as a file
The first load breaks the UI security state since it is considered a top level document load and also has transferred data. We don't update security state only in OnLocationChange since top level document load stop may be valid for changing security state while we don't change the location. (I have to remember why exactly, I think wyciwyg channels are one of the cases.)
I need an advice whether there is some generic way how to determine the number of bytes that has actually been rendered (ns\*ContentSink?).

Simply avoiding call to EvaluateAndUpdateSecurityState when the request didn't render any data is not a solution here. That breaks mixed content indicators. To explain:
- I go to a secured page (<https://server.com/secured.html>)
- I navigate with an anchor on that page to a secured page that has a mixed content, e.g. an http image (<https://server.com/mixed.html>)
- I click the bad-feed link on the midex.html page
- that would trigger this bug (as stated in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=745254#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security UI needs to stop assuming that bytes transferred == bytes rendered"))
- but, when I instrument the code \*not\* to call EvaluateAndUpdateSecurityState from OnStateChange(STOP, DOCUMENT\_LOAD) at [1] this bug disappears (\*) ; state is still "no ssl"
- I go back to the initial secured page, state is back to "secure"
- I go forward to the mixed content page => state is unexpectedly "secure"
Reason:
- when I click the bad-feed link, sec UI in OnStateChange(START, DOCUMENT\_LOAD) resets subrequest counters to all zeros (there are counters for non-secure, secure, etc - basis for mixed content UI)
- with my patch, when I later click back, these zeros are mis-stored to the associated security info of the <https://server.com/mixed.html> channel instead to the associated security info of the bad-feed ; mCurrentToplevelSecurityInfo is not assigned the bad-feed's info object because of the missing call to EvaluateAndUpdateSecurityState :(
- when navigating forward to the mixed.html page, associated content security is restored to all zeros => state is "secured"
I have to think of a solution here... A long time ago I wanted to track the subrequests strictly only in the current secinfo object and therefor don't need to restore/switch tracking members, and ask it for the tracking info when telling UI the state.
I'll try to have a patch for it by tomorrow.
[1] <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/424cb3a6141b/security/manager/boot/src/nsSecureBrowserUIImpl.cpp#l1230>
(\*) The security state doesn't change after OnLocationChange (checked!), so invoking EvaluateAndUpdateSecurityState is redundant in updating the UI and internal top level load security state when called from OnStateChange(STOP, DOCUMENT\_LOAD) ; clicking the bad-feed link doesn't invoke OnLocationChange, since nsDSURIContentListener is not used as the load consumer - this is expected.

Attached patch

[v1](attachment.cgi?id=618367&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=618367&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=745254&attachment=618367)

- prevents redundant security state update and notification from OnStateChange(STOP | DOCUMENT) that is causing this bug
- update and onSecurityChange notification now invoked only from OnLocationChange
- I've checked the state doesn't change between OnLocationChange() and OnStateChange(STOP | DOCUMENT)
- if there is no OnLocationChange between OnStateChange(START | DOCUMENT) and OnStateChange(STOP | DOCUMENT) the content hasn't been targeted to a docshell and therefor it hasn't been rendered (RETARGETED flag isn't not set in case of the FeedConverter)
- if the target sink is changing in OnStateChange(STOP | DOCUMENT) (usually is being set, in a brand new window), we trigger the state update and notification even from OnStateChange(STOP | DOCUMENT)
- also, when there is no OnLocationChange leading to security state update and notification, we revert subrequest counters to the vales saved in OnStateChange(START | DOCUMENT) otherwise on navigating back in the session history would overwrite the potentially non-zero values of the counters with all zeros masking mixed state on going forward
- updates browser\_alltabslistener.js test: redundant security notification is removed, only one onSecurityChange is expected

I guess there isn't any existing test infrastructure to easily write tests for this? browser\_alltabslistener.js is better than nothing, but seems like an area that would benefit from better, more targeted test coverage :/

security/mixedcontent. We have mochitests for this. But not for this one particular case that needs atom involved. I can write a test, but I'm more worried about not regressing the current overall functionality.

Hmm okay. Still a bit puzzled, as on ESR, I'm not seeing this fixed based on what I interpret in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=745254#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security UI needs to stop assuming that bytes transferred == bytes rendered"), but I may not be running the test correctly. Here's what I did:
1. Go to <http://www.google.com>
2. Enter <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=614200> into the address bar
3. Download dialog appears
4. Click cancel

Oh, that would explain why I'm seeing that not working. I'm not running the latest ESR build.

Or maybe not. I don't see a Firefox 10.0.5 ESR build on ftp.mozilla.org (or maybe I'm not looking at the right spot?)

Ah figured it out. My bad. I'll re-run this test with latest-mozilla-esr10.

Verified on Firefox 10 ESR 5 (now I have the right build). I did what I said in [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=745254#c22 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security UI needs to stop assuming that bytes transferred == bytes rendered"), didn't look I hit issues. I also clicked identity button after I completed [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=745254#c22 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security UI needs to stop assuming that bytes transferred == bytes rendered")'s steps, which reverted the location bar to the current webpage location (<http://www.google.com>) along with google's identification information. This seems valid.

js\_CloneScript that was introduced in the [bug 584789](/show_bug.cgi?id=584789 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make functions per compartment, and deep copy instead of clone them if needed") only preserves the principals for the script itself and keeps the principals for all nested functions and their scripts set to null.

Its a crasher in a bunch of places. I think this is a [dos] only, but Blake is more familiar with this code.

I just realized that we could fix this bug and reduce the size of our serialized scripts by only serializing the principals once. This assumes that all the JSScripts can share a principal and all the sub JSScripts are effectively the same. I have no idea if that's true since I have no idea what principals are, but my browser does start with this patch. I see a 8% drop in the serialized XPIProvider.jsm with this patch. (168612 -> 155092)

patch v1
This bug got a little bit more complicated to fix after the introduction of originPrincipals. Before originPrincipals, we could have simply re-serialized the principal as the principal of the current compartment. Now, however, we have to preserve one principal but not the other. So this patch makes us preserve the principal through the clone operation and the does a fixup pass to make the principal correct.

What about adding optional 'newPrincipals' / 'newOriginPrincipals' arguments to js\_XDRScript/js\_XDRNewFunctionObject? If these were non-null, we could completely skip the principals XDR block and, if decoding, use these as the script's principals/originPrincipals. IIUC, this would be only a few lines change and easy to follow.

All the nested functions have the same principals as their master script. So this suggest the following approach. We completely remove encoding-decoding of principals from script serialization. Then we add a separated API that assign the given principal and origin to the script and all its bested functions. This API will be used during parsing, cloning and by mozilla component loader in uniform fashion.

Note that for a spot fix for this bug we can add fields to XDR with necessary principals. Then during encoding the code would assert that encountered principals match the principals in xdr and during decoding they will be used for initialization.

Sounds good. It may even speedup overall XDR decoding, depending on the overall speed of principal encoding/decoding.

[separate principals from scripts](attachment.cgi?id=595576&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=595576&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=643967&attachment=595576)

The patch adds a new method, JSSScript::initPrincipals, that recursively assigns the principals to all the nested scripts. This allows to separate xdr of principals from script encoding/decoding. As a bonus, the principals are now serialized once per top-level script.
Changing the parser to use the same method to avoid passing around all the principals is for another bug.

There is another bug in our xdr serializer. Our scanner allows one to write
//@line <line> "<filename>"
to specifythe explicit filename that should be used in error reporting and stored in the script. That can present in the file multiple times. When we create script, we set JSScript::filename to the current value of filename. That implies that different functions in a script can have different filename. However, our xdr serializer does not know about that and stores only the name of the main script.
AFAICS this leads only to a harmless assert. Also, this does not affect js\_CloneScript since it is used only to clone functions and for function we always parse its whole source before emitting any scripts for nested functions.
I also assume that we do not use JSScript::filename in any security checks. On the other hand, as script-embedded filename can be almost arbitrary sequence of bytes up to 1024 bytes in length, do we deal properly with that when using filename, for example, to display the source location in the error reports?

I think that in Firefox, we currently never enable JSOPTION\_ATLINE, so we should be safe from this for now. We might want to fix this bug for embedders, though.
That being said, Luke had a plan for js\_CloneScript that involved splitting out the core of the script from the objects in order to avoid this crazy serialization/deserialization. Luke, is there a bug filed on that?

I was wrong here - the issue is that JS\_XDRFunctionObject was not updated to deal with nested closures while js\_CloneFunctionObject properly creates and initializes the clone. As JS\_XDRFunctionObject is not exposed to web scripts, this is just an issue for XBL serialization.

I noticed that nsJSContext::CompileEventHandler, <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/f88a05e00f47/dom/base/nsJSEnvironment.cpp#l1802> , compiles its handlers without principals with comments:
// Event handlers are always shared, and must be bound before use.
// Therefore we never bother compiling with principals.
However, this means that nested functions in the event handlers also have null principals. Why is this safe?
Blake, could you comment on that?

There is yet another issue with CloneScript. The [bug 661903](/show_bug.cgi?id=661903 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move script filename table to the compartment") has moved the script table to the compartment, yet I missed during the review that the js\_CloneScript code skip encoding/decoding of JSScript::filename and just set the filename for the decoded script to the original one. That results in JSScript with a pointer to the filename from a different compartment so that filename can be GC-ed.

This is safe because event handlers are always cloned function objects. Because of this, in order to compute their principals, caps ignores their script (and therefore their script->principals) and instead uses their actual scope chains (parent link) to find their principals.

But what about a nested function defined in the event handler? In the clone it will still have null principals. If this nested function is optimized, at run time we skip creating closure for it and will use it as is during execution AFAIK.

I inspected that code with Luke and it looks OK to me. IIUC, the script argument to CloneScript and its nested scripts will be in the same compartment, so it's OK for them to share filenames. I built a browser that asserts the filename matches the compartment when they are assigned, and it starts up and does stuff fine. I'm running it on try now.

I fixed this issue in the [bug 725576](/show_bug.cgi?id=725576 "VERIFIED FIXED - serialize principals only once per top-level script"). So the only remaining issue is the [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=643967#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - js_CloneScript does not preserve principals for nested functions").

All that's left is to check with mrbkap on [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=643967#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - js_CloneScript does not preserve principals for nested functions"). But he's on vacation right now, so we'll have to ask when he gets back.

So, I keep meaning to read a bunch of code but I haven't had time to do so. Basically, the answer to [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=643967#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - js_CloneScript does not preserve principals for nested functions") is that it used to be safe to assume that we wouldn't optimize nested functions in event handlers since there was no way that their global would be the "correct" global and we would be guaranteed to clone the function object, which would be safe.
However, reading through the code now, it appears that null closures that are METHODs can appear on the JS stack for a security check without having been cloned, meaning that caps would get confused... So unless I'm confused (which is very possible here!) there is a little work left to do. At the very least, it'd be good to have a testcase showing that this is either safe or not.

What luck, [bug 739808](/show_bug.cgi?id=739808 "VERIFIED FIXED - rm null closure no-clone optimization") removed methods. So that shouldn't be a problem. However, there is also this CloneFunctionObjectIfNotSingleton (<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/jsfuninlines.h#246>). This function, it seems, mutates the parent/environment of the compiler-created function in-place. Is that good enough?

Yes. From IRC:
19:12 < bhackett> mrbkap: for functions, native functions will have singleton types, and scripted functions declared in global scope
so lambdas will never have singleton types and we'll always create cloned function objects. I think we can resolve this bug, finally.

I don't really know that much about the bug itself, so I don't have any brilliant ideas. [Bug 739808](/show_bug.cgi?id=739808 "VERIFIED FIXED - rm null closure no-clone optimization") should not be that hard to rebase, or alternatively, a relatively small patch (similar to my first one in that bug) could disable the optimization. Not sure about [bug 725576](/show_bug.cgi?id=725576 "VERIFIED FIXED - serialize principals only once per top-level script").

Just spoke to Luke and Blake - they do not believe [bug 725576](/show_bug.cgi?id=725576 "VERIFIED FIXED - serialize principals only once per top-level script") is necessary on the ESR as long as [bug 739808](/show_bug.cgi?id=739808 "VERIFIED FIXED - rm null closure no-clone optimization") was properly fixed. Additionally, the backport would be very painful. Marking the ESR as fixed here and [bug 725576](/show_bug.cgi?id=725576 "VERIFIED FIXED - serialize principals only once per top-level script") as wontfix for ESR.

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes three new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to 10.0.5ESR fixing various
bugs and security issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-34 Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey,
Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox 12.(CVE-2012-1938)
Christian Holler reported a memory safety problem
that affects Firefox ESR. (CVE-2012-1939)
Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse
Ruderman reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR and Firefox 13. (CVE-2012-1937)
Ken Russell of Google reported a bug in NVIDIA
graphics drivers that they needed to work around in the
Chromium WebGL implementation. Mozilla has done the same in
Firefox 13 and ESR 10.0.5. (CVE-2011-3101)
\*
MFSA 2012-35 Security researcher James Forshaw of
Context Information Security found two issues with the
Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater service introduced
in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows Mozilla's
updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context.
The updater can be called by the Updater Service or
independently on systems that do not use the service. The
second of these issues allows for the updater service to
load an arbitrary local DLL file, which can then be run
with the same system privileges used by the service. Both
of these issues require local file system access to be
exploitable.
Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service
(CVE-2012-1942) Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from
application directory (CVE-2012-1943)
\*
MFSA 2012-36 Security researcher Adam Barth found
that inline event handlers, such as onclick, were no longer
blocked by Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script
blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature
of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were
not fully protected. (CVE-2012-1944)
\*
MFSA 2012-37 Security researcher Paul Stone reported
an attack where an HTML page hosted on a Windows share and
then loaded could then load Windows shortcut files (.lnk)
in the same share. These shortcut files could then link to
arbitrary locations on the local file system of the
individual loading the HTML page. That page could show the
contents of these linked files or directories from the
local file system in an iframe, causing information
disclosure.
This issue could potentially affect Linux machines
with samba shares enabled. (CVE-2012-1945)
\*
MFSA 2012-38 Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find a use-after-free while
replacing/inserting a node in a document. This
use-after-free could possibly allow for remote code
execution. (CVE-2012-1946)
\*
MFSA 2012-39 Security researcher Kaspar Brand found a
flaw in how the Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1
decoder handles zero length items. Effects of this issue
depend on the field. One known symptom is an unexploitable
crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles
zero-length basic constraints, assuming default values for
some types that should be rejected as malformed. These
issues have been addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now
being used by Mozilla. (CVE-2012-0441)
\*
MFSA 2012-40 Security researcher Abhishek Arya of
Google used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover several
issues: two heap buffer overflow bugs and a use-after-free
problem. The first heap buffer overflow was found in
conversion from unicode to native character sets when the
function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList
when working with column layout with absolute positioning
in a container that changes size. The second buffer
overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState when a window is
resized on a page with nested columns and a combination of
absolute and relative positioning. All three of these
issues are potentially exploitable.
Heap-buffer-overflow in utf16\_to\_isolatin1
(CVE-2012-1947) Heap-use-after-free in
nsFrameList::FirstChild (CVE-2012-1940)
Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLReflowState::CalculateHypotheticalBox, with nested
multi-column, relative position, and absolute position
(CVE-2012-1941)

## Synopsis

Critical: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0715)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3101,
CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939, CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941,
CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
Thunderbird no longer blocked Thunderbird inline event handlers. Malicious
content could possibly bypass intended restrictions if that content relied
on CSP to protect against flaws such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
(CVE-2012-1944)

If a web server hosted content that is stored on a Microsoft Windows share,
or a Samba share, loading such content with Thunderbird could result in
Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
content from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ken Russell of Google as the original reporter of
CVE-2011-3101; Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman
as the original reporters of CVE-2012-1937; Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov,
Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy as the
original reporters of CVE-2012-1938; Christian Holler as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-1939; security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google as
the original reporter of CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, and CVE-2012-1947;
security researcher Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1946; security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1944; and security researcher Paul Stone as the original reporter
of CVE-2012-1945.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

I was trying to understand how new nodelist bindings work and noticed that
release may happen in ::finalize. Is it possible that it may cause similar problems
as what [bug 712448](/show_bug.cgi?id=712448 "RESOLVED FIXED - Slim wrappers do not use deferred release mechanism, causing GC crashes") caused?

| [Comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=723465#c1)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

Would it be possible to assert in NS\_RELEASE that we're not inside a GC? Ben says that he is using NS\_RELEASE from a finalizer in a safe way, so maybe we could have some sort of whitelisted version that doesn't do the assert.

Will we need this for branches?
What are the security implications here?

|  | |

Yes, we'll need this for branches, the code exists all the way back to esr, but I don't know for sure if it's enabled there or not.
AFAICT, the implications here is that we could potentially run arbitrary code while we're in GC, and that's sg:critical kinda bad.
Peter, please correct me if I'm wrong here...

[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): [bug 648801](/show_bug.cgi?id=648801 "RESOLVED FIXED - Prototype a proxy-based NodeList implementation")
User impact if declined: security bug (could cause scripts running during the GC)
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): landed on inbound, has a crashtest
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): low risk, we're just delaying destruction of object till after the GC is done
String changes made by this patch: None

Verified in debug trunk build for 4/30. When I run the testcase from [Bug 736825](/show_bug.cgi?id=736825 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - \"Assertion failure: !rt->gcRunning\" with querySelectorAll") on the 4/28 debug build, I get the assert and then this crash:

On 4/30 debug trunk, I get no assert and no crash.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED
