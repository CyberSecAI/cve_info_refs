Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the usage of unsafe methods for determining how to load DLLs in multiple JustSystems products. This likely refers to a DLL hijacking vulnerability where the applications search for DLLs in predictable locations, enabling an attacker to place a malicious DLL that gets loaded instead.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure DLL loading: The applications do not properly validate or control the location from which they load dynamic libraries.
- DLL Search Path issue: The vulnerability is specifically related to the DLL search path used by the vulnerable applications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the running application. This means the attacker's code can perform any action that the legitimate application can perform on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- DLL hijacking: The attacker places a malicious DLL with the same name as one of the DLLs the application is attempting to load, in a location where the application will find it before the legitimate DLL. The application loads the malicious DLL and executes the attacker's code.
- The attack can be conducted over the Internet using packets, requiring a user interaction such as clicking a link or viewing a file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location that is part of the application's DLL search path.
- Some expertise and luck are required to exploit this vulnerability, such as expertise in Windows function calls.
- The user must be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful.
- No authentication is required.
