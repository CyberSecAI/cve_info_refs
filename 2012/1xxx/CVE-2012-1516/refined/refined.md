- The vulnerability is triggered due to a flaw in the handler function for RPC commands, leading to the manipulation of data pointers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A guest user can potentially crash the VMX process.
- There is a possibility of arbitrary code execution on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through a guest operating system running within a virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a guest account within a virtual machine.
- Root or Administrator level permissions are *not* required to exploit this specific issue.

**Additional Notes**
- Virtual machines using less than 4 GB of memory are not affected by this specific vulnerability
