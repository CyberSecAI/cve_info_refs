Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1663

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in a double-free condition within the GnuTLS library's certificate parsing logic. Specifically, it occurs when importing a crafted X.509 certificate, where an error during the public key import leads to a premature deinitialization of the public key and subsequent double free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Double-Free: The core issue is a double-free vulnerability, triggered in `gnutls_pubkey_import_x509` function.
- Improper Error Handling: An error during public key import is not handled correctly, causing the double free. Specifically, the code deinitializes `pcert->pubkey`, then proceeds to free this memory again at a later point.
- Crafted Certificate: The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted certificate that causes an import error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The double-free vulnerability can cause a crash or unpredictable behavior, leading to a denial of service. The exploit-db entry specifically mentions that it could consume excessive memory and slow down the machine.
- Memory Corruption: A double free can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities, though this is not explicitly described in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Certificate: The primary attack vector is the use of a specially crafted certificate.
- Client and Server Side Vulnerability: The vulnerability could be exploited on both client and server side, during certificate imports.
- High frequency use: The exploit-db author mentions high-frequency manipulation of certificates in order to increase the chances of triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Supply Crafted Certificate: The attacker must be able to provide a crafted certificate that triggers the error in `gnutls_pubkey_import_x509`.
- Network Position (potentially):  The attacker could be in a position to supply certificates to either the server or the client of a TLS connection.
- Software/Version: The attacker needs to target a system using GnuTLS versions prior to 3.0.14.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The exploit-db content references the vulnerable code section within the function gnutls_pubkey_import_x509 where the double free occurs.
```c
ret = gnutls_pubkey_import_x509(pcert->pubkey, crt, 0);
  if (ret < 0)
    {
      gnutls_pubkey_deinit(pcert->pubkey);
      /* pcert->pubkey should be NULL now */
      ret = gnutls_assert_val(ret);
      goto cleanup;
    }
```
- The exploit-db article provided a PoC (Proof of Concept) which was available at a gitlab URL, as well as github.
- The issue was fixed in GnuTLS version 3.0.14.

In summary, CVE-2012-1663 is a double-free vulnerability in GnuTLS that can be exploited by providing a crafted certificate, leading to a denial of service. The provided content from exploit-db gives some more technical detail of the vulnerability than the standard CVE description.
