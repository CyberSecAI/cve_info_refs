### What is a Digital Experience Platform (DXP) and how does it differ from a Content Management System (CMS)?

"Designed to provide better customer experiences, Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) are the natural evolution of your good old (or not so old) CMS, simply with much more functionality and seamless integrations giving you a new perspective in a world that has now fully pivoted to be customer-centric on all fronts."

[How a DXP is different from a CMS](https://www.ibexa.co/blog/what-is-a-digital-experience-platform-dxp-compared-to-a-content-management-system-cms)

### Where's eZ Platform?

Many of our visitors may be wondering [what is Ibexa DXP](/what-is-ibexa-dxp) and where is [eZ Platform](/ez-platform)?

The first iteration of [Ibexa DXP was released on October 26th 2020](https://www.ibexa.co/blog/product-launch-introducing-ibexa-dxp-3.2). The Ibexa DXP name essentially replaces the eZ Platform name. Going forward our products will be known by a different name, but this does not mean or change any commitments we have regarding product support.

For previous generation (eZ Platform) and legacy (eZ Publish) product documentation, please refer to: [eZ Platform 2.5](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/master/releases/ez_platform_v2.5/), [eZ Publish 5.x](https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP/eZ%2BPublish%2B5.x%2BDeveloper%2BDocumentation), [eZ Publish 4.](https://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish)
