Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the XML::Atom Perl module's default handling of external XML entities and network access. Prior to version 0.39, the module was susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to its processing of external entities and network connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core issue is the module's parsing of XML documents while having external entity processing enabled. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious XML code that could force the parser to fetch external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting XXE, an attacker could potentially read local files on the server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause the application to consume excessive resources by including large external files in an XML document.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could make the server make arbitrary requests to other servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By supplying a specially crafted XML document to the XML::Atom module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an XML document to the application using the vulnerable XML::Atom module.
- No special capabilities or privileges are explicitly mentioned, but the attacker would need to have some form of interaction with the vulnerable service that utilizes XML::Atom.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix in version 0.39 disables external entities and network access during XML parsing. The patch includes a `libxml_parser` subroutine that disables `expand_xinclude`, sets `expand_entities` to 1 (which is required for some parsing but has the potential to be unsafe, and thus is disabled in later XML parsers by default), and sets `load_ext_dtd` to 0. It also disables external entity handling through a custom handler. Additionally a `expat_parser` was added to provide the same security measures for those not using libxml.
- The provided patch diff further confirms that the fix involved disabling the loading of external DTDs and disabling external entity processing.
