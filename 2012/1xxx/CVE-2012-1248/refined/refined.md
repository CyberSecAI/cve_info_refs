Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a flaw in how baserCMS manages user sessions. Specifically, it uses a shared session storage mechanism ('session') instead of a dedicated one ('cake'), causing session data to potentially overlap between different baserCMS installations on the same server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Management Flaw:** The primary vulnerability lies in the improper session management implementation. The system was configured to save sessions using a shared 'session' handler instead of 'cake'.
- **Shared Session Storage:** The vulnerability stems from using a shared session storage that doesn't isolate sessions between different baserCMS instances.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** If multiple baserCMS installations exist on the same server, logging into one site could grant the user access to other baserCMS sites on the same server.
- **Admin Privilege Escalation:** This unauthorized access could lead to an attacker gaining administrator privileges on different baserCMS sites, enabling them to modify content, configurations, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based, which means an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely if they have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Same Server, Multiple Instances:** The vulnerability is triggered when a server hosts multiple baserCMS instances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the server hosting the vulnerable baserCMS instances.
- **User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on at least one of the baserCMS installations on the server. This account does not need administrative privileges.
- **No Authentication Required to Access Other Instances:** After logging into one instance, no further authentication is required to access other instances.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in baserCMS versions 1.6.15 and earlier.
- The fix involves modifying the `app/config/core.php` file.
-  The line `Configure::write('Session.save', 'session');`  needs to be changed to `Configure::write('Session.save', 'cake');`. This modification changes the session storage mechanism to isolate sessions between different baserCMS installations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS v2 score of 4.0.
- JPCERT/CC classifies the severity as High for access required, authentication, and user interaction, but only Mid-High for exploit complexity.
-  The fix is either to upgrade to the latest version of baserCMS or apply the workaround by modifying the session configuration.
