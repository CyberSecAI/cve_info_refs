Software Version 5.0.1 New and Changed Features

WAAS software Version 5.0.1 includes the following new features and changes:

(cid:129) Cisco AppNav—The Cisco AppNav solution is a combination hardware and software solution that
uses the new Cisco AppNav Controller Interface Modules to simplify network integration of WAN
optimization and can overcome challenges with provisioning, scalability, asymmetry, and high
availability. When equipped with a Cisco AppNav Controller Interface Module, a WAVE appliance
can operate in the new AppNav Controller device mode where it intercepts network traffic and
distributes that traffic to one or more WAAS nodes for optimization. AppNav greatly reduces
dependency on the intercepting switch or router by distributing traffic among WAAS nodes for
optimization using a powerful class and policy mechanism that can be configured to optimize traffic
based on branch or application affinity.

(cid:129) Support for three new Cisco AppNav Controller Interface Modules—12xGE copper and 12xGE SFP
fiber interface modules are available for WAVE-694/7541/7571/8541 platforms and a 4x10GE SFP+
fiber interface module is available for the WAVE-594 appliance. These interface modules allow
WAVE appliance operation in the new AppNav Controller device mode and support both inline and
WCCP traffic interception.

(cid:129) Central Manager—The WAAS Central Manager user interface has been streamlined, supports more
browsers, has reorganized and easier to use menu navigation, and makes it easier to switch between
devices and groups. The monitoring and reporting facility has improved graphical reports and charts
and can monitor individual class maps. A new Reports Central user interface simplifies report
management. A new alarm reporting panel makes alarms always accessible with one click.

(cid:129) SMB Application Accelerator—A new SMB application accelerator optimizes CIFS traffic. This
application accelerator supports SMBv1, has added support for native SMBv2 protocols, and
optimizes signed SMBv2 traffic. (It does not provide appreciable optimization benefits for signed
SMBv1 traffic.) To optimize CIFS traffic, you can choose between the CIFS and SMB application
accelerators, which cannot be enabled simultaneously. The SMB accelerator does not yet support
prepositioning or the Windows Print accelerator.

(cid:129) Encrypted MAPI Application Acceleration—The MAPI application accelerator is enhanced to optimize
encrypted MAPI traffic over secure connections using DCERPC privacy (encryption and signing).

Note

The encrypted MAPI feature is in extended beta trials. You must contact
waas-emapi-cs@external.cisco.com with your Cisco account team on the CC for approvals,
before enabling this feature. Only approved customers will be supported for beta evaluations.
The encrypted MAPI feature will be made generally available in a following release.

New and Changed Features

(cid:129) SSL Application Acceleration Enhancement—The SSL application accelerator is enhanced to

support Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).

(cid:129) Data Redundancy Elimination (DRE) Enhancements—DRE is enhanced for better performance and
a new feature allows the system to bypass DRE optimization for traffic flows that do not benefit from
such optimization.

(cid:129) WAAS Express Support—Support for interoperability with WAAS Express in Cisco IOS Release
15.2(3)T or later. WAAS Express is enhanced with added support for HTTPS traffic as well as
improved performance for file operations.

(cid:129) Windows Domain Configuration Enhancements—Automatic detection of Kerberos domain settings

and a simpler user interface eases Windows domain join configuration.

(cid:129) Policy Enhancements—Optimization policy is simplified with a new user interface and CLI, and

AppNav policy is introduced to control traffic distribution in an AppNav deployment.

(cid:129) Application Accelerator Monitoring—A new application accelerator monitoring features allows you
to set a load threshold that triggers an alarm if an application accelerator becomes overloaded.

(cid:129) Troubleshooting Enhancements—New WAAS TCP Traceroute and AppNav connection tracing

tools, and a new packet capture CLI command, provide better network and configuration
troubleshooting.

(cid:129) WCCP Enhancements—Enhancements include a Layer 2 egress method, a new mode to support

AppNav deployments, and faster failure detection options (3 and 6 seconds) on AppNav Controllers.
Additionally, WCCP flow protection is disabled by default on new installations (previously, flow
protection was enabled by default, with no timeout). The Central Manager now manages WCCP
configuration at the device level only; device group settings for WCCP are no longer supported but
settings can be copied between devices. Static bypass lists are no longer supported on WAAS
devices running WAAS version 5.0.1 or later; interception ACLs provide this functionality. WCCP
configuration is simplified and the return method is set the same as the redirect method. The
available egress methods also depend on the redirect method.

(cid:129)

Interface Configuration Enhancements—You can now designate a specific interface to handle all
management traffic. Standby groups can include port-channel interfaces, and a new src-dst-ip
port-channel load balancing method is available. Jumbo maximum transmission unit (MTU) frames
are supported. A new bridge group type is introduced to support bridging inline interfaces on an
AppNav Controller.

(cid:129) AAA Enhancements—The AAA accounting facility is enhanced with the ability to enable and

disable the accounting of CLI commands that result from Central Manager actions.

(cid:129) SNMP Enhancements—The CISCO-APPNAV-MIB is provided to allow monitoring of AppNav

deployments and the CISCO-WAN-OPTIMIZATION-MIB is enhanced to allow better monitoring
of the system and individual application accelerators. Additionally, the obsolete
ACTONA-ACTASTOR-MIB is removed.

(cid:129) WAE-512 and WAE-612 appliances and NME-WAE-302 and NME-WAE-522 modules—These

appliances and modules are no longer supported and WAAS version 5.0 and later does not operate
on these appliances and modules. Upgrading to WAAS version 5.0 on these devices (or on a device
group that contains any of these devices) is not allowed.

(cid:129) Baseline Groups—Support for baseline groups is removed in WAAS version 5.0.

(cid:129) CLI commands—For CLI command changes, see the “Software Version 5.0.1 Command Changes”

section on page 22.

(cid:129) Monitoring API—For API changes, see the “Software Version 5.0.1 Monitoring API Changes”

section on page 27.

WAAS Appliance System Firmware Update

BIOS Update

On WAE and WAVE appliances, we recommend that you update the following three types of system
firmware to the latest version, to best support new WAAS features:

(cid:129) BIOS on the WAVE-594/694/7541/7571/8541 models—For details, see the “BIOS Update” section

on page 5. The latest BIOS is required for AppNav operation.

(cid:129) BMC firmware on the WAVE-294/594/694/7541/7571/8541 models—For details, see the “BMC

Firmware Update” section on page 6. The latest BMC firmware is required for the IPMI over LAN
feature.

(cid:129) RAID controller firmware on the WAE-674/7341/7371 and WAVE-7541/7571/8541—For details,
see the “RAID Controller Firmware Update” section on page 7. The latest RAID controller firmware
is recommended to avoid some rarely encountered RAID controller issues.

The latest BIOS is required for AppNav operation with a Cisco AppNav Controller Interface Module in
WAVE-594/694/7541/7571/8541 models. WAVE-294 models do not need a BIOS update.

WAAS appliances shipped from the factory with WAAS version 5.0.1 or later have the correct BIOS
installed. If you are updating a device that was shipped with an earlier version of WAAS software, you
should update the BIOS, unless it was updated previously. WAVE-594/694 models require BIOS version
17A and WAVE-7541/7571/8541 models require BIOS version 11A.

If you install a Cisco AppNav Controller Interface Module in a device that requires a BIOS update, the
bios_support_seiom major alarm is raised, “I/O module may not get the best I/O performance with the
installed version of the system BIOS firmware.”

<<<<< version 17A

If a BMC firmware update is needed, you can download it from cisco.com at the Wide Area Application
Service (WAAS) Firmware download page (registered customers only). The firmware binary image is
named waas-bios-installer-16a-17a-11a-k9.bin.

You can use the following command to update the BIOS from the image file that is available through
FTP on your network:

copy ftp install ip-address remotefiledir waas-bios-installer-16a-17a-11a-k9.bin

The complete update process can take several minutes and the device may appear unresponsive but do
not interrupt the process or power cycle the device. After the update is complete, you must reload the
device.

After the device reboots, you can verify the firmware version by using the show hardware command.

BMC Firmware Update

IPMI over LAN requires that you install a specific BMC firmware version on the device. The minimum
supported BMC firmware versions are as follows:

(cid:129) WAVE-294/594/694—48a

(cid:129) WAVE-7541/7571/8541—26a

WAAS appliances shipped from the factory with WAAS version 4.4.5 or later have the correct firmware
installed. If you are updating a device that was shipped with an earlier version of WAAS software, you
must update the BMC firmware, unless it was updated previously.

To determine if you are running the correct firmware version, use the show bmc info command. The
following example displays the latest BMC firmware version installed on the device (48a here):

<<<<< version 48

If a BMC firmware update is needed, you can download it from cisco.com at the Wide Area Application
Service (WAAS) Firmware download page (registered customers only). The firmware binary image is
named waas-bmc-installer-48a-48a-26a-k9.bin.

You can use the following command to update the firmware from the image file that is available through
FTP on your network:

copy ftp install ip-address remotefiledir waas-bmc-installer-48a-48a-26a-k9.bin

The update process automatically checks the health status of the BMC firmware. If the system detects
that the BMC firmware is corrupted, BMC is recovered during the BMC firmware update procedure. The
complete update process can take several minutes. If the device appears unresponsive, do not interrupt
the process or power cycle the device. After the update is complete, you must reload the device.

After the device reboots, you can verify the firmware version by using the show bmc info command.

BMC recovery and BMC firmware update restores the factory defaults on the BMC and all the current
IPMI over LAN configurations are erased.

If the BMC firmware gets corrupted, a critical alarm is raised.

RAID Controller Firmware Update

We recommend that you upgrade to the latest RAID controller firmware for your hardware platform,
which can be found on cisco.com at the Wide Area Application Service (WAAS) Firmware download
page (registered customers only). The firmware differs depending on your hardware platform:

(cid:129) WAVE-7541/7571/8541—Update to the 12.12.0 (0060) RAID Controller Firmware (or later

version).

The firmware binary image is named waas-raid-fw-installer-12.12.0-0060-k9.bin. Instructions on
how to apply the firmware update are posted on cisco.com together with the firmware in the file
named M2_0060_FIRMWARE.pdf, which you can see when you mouse over the firmware file.

(cid:129) WAE-674/7341/7371—Update to the 5.2-0 (17002) RAID Controller Firmware (or later version).
You can check your current RAID controller firmware version with the show disk tech-support
EXEC command. The Firmware field displays the firmware version.

The firmware binary image is named L4_xxxxx_FIRMWARE.bin. Instructions on how to apply the
firmware update are posted on cisco.com together with the firmware in the file named
L4_xxxxx_FIRMWARE.pdf, which you can see when you mouse over the firmware file.

Under rare circumstances, the RAID controller firmware used in the WAE-674, WAE-7341, and
WAE-7371 appliances can cause the disk storage subsystem to go offline and the affected devices to stop
optimizing connections. The symptoms are as follows:

(cid:129) Syslog output contains several instances of the following message:
“WAAS-SYS-3-900000: sd 0:0:0:0: rejecting I/O to offline device.”

(cid:129) A sysreport and running-config file cannot be generated and copied to /local/local1.

Both these symptoms are an indication of the file system becoming read-only during traffic flow.

(cid:129) An increasing number of pending connections appear in the output of the show statistics tfo

command, which indicates that new connections cannot be optimized. You can use this command to
proactively check the functionality of the system.

The solution is to upgrade to the 5.2-0 (17002) RAID Controller Firmware (or later version).

The WAAS software operates on these hardware platforms: WAE-674,
WAE-7341, WAE-7371, WAVE-274, WAVE-474, WAVE-574, WAVE-294,
WAVE-594, WAVE-694, WAVE-7541, WAVE-7571, or WAVE-8541
appliance, or an NME-WAE-502, SM-SRE-700, SM-SRE-710,
SM-SRE-900, or SM-SRE-910 network module that is installed in specific
Cisco routers. Additionally, Cisco 880 Series, 890 Series, and ISR G2
routers running WAAS Express are supported on the branch side (WAAS
version 4.2.1 or later is required on the data center side). You must deploy
the WAAS Central Manager on a dedicated device.

The WAAS software running on a branch WAE interoperates with these
CIFS clients: Windows 98/NT 4.0/2000/XP/Vista/7 and
Windows Server 2003/2008 R2.

The WAAS Central Manager GUI requires Internet Explorer version 8 or 9
(only 8 on Windows XP), Firefox version 4 or later, Chrome version 10 or
later, or Safari version 5.x (only on Apple OS X) and the Adobe Flash Player
browser plug-in. The WAE Device Manager GUI requires Internet Explorer
version 5.5 or later.

If you are using Internet Explorer to access the Central Manager GUI, we strongly recommend that you
install the Google Chrome Frame plug-in to provide better performance. When you log into the Central
Manager the first time, you are prompted to install Google Chrome Frame. Choose a language, click Get
Google Chrome Frame, and follow the prompts to download and install the plug-in. If you do not want
to install the plug-in, click the link to continue without installing Google Chrome Frame.

Note When using Internet Explorer, ensure that the Tools > Internet Options > Advanced tab > Do not save
encrypted pages to disk check box (under Security) is checked. If this box is unchecked, some charts do
not display (CIFS device level charts and version 4.x scheduled reports that have completed).

Upgrading and Interoperability

WAAS Version Interoperability

Consider the following guidelines when operating a WAAS network that mixes Version 5.0.x devices
with devices running earlier software versions:

(cid:129) WAAS Version 5.0.x is not supported running in a mixed version WAAS network where any WAAS
device is running a software version earlier than 4.2.1. If you have any WAAS devices running a
version earlier than 4.2.1, you must first upgrade them to Version 4.2.1 (or a later version) before
you install Version 5.0. Do not upgrade any device to a version later than the existing Central
Manager version. After all devices and the Central Manager are running version 4.2.1 or later, you
can begin the upgrade to version 5.0.1 on the WAAS Central Manager. Directly upgrading a device
from version 4.0 or 4.1 to 5.0 is not supported.

(cid:129)

In a mixed version WAAS network, the WAAS Central Manager must be running the highest version
of the WAAS software.

AppNav Interoperability

Consider the following guidelines when deploying the Cisco AppNav solution:

(cid:129)

If you are connecting an AppNav Controller (ANC) to a Catalyst 6500 series switch and you have
configured the ANC to use WCCP with the L2 redirect method, do not deploy the ANC on the same
subnet as the client computers. This configuration can cause packet loss due to a limitation of the
Catalyst 6500 series switch.

(cid:129) All WAAS nodes in an AppNav deployment must be running WAAS version 5.0 or later.

(cid:129) WAAS Express devices cannot operate as WAAS nodes in an AppNav deployment.

WAAS Express Interoperability

Consider the following guideline when using WAAS Express devices in your WAAS network:

(cid:129) When using a WAAS device running version 5.0 and a WAAS Express peer device running Cisco
IOS Release 15.2(2)T or earlier, connections originating from the WAAS device and sent to the
WAAS Express peer are passed through instead of being optimized. We recommend upgrading to
WAAS Express in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(3)T or later to take advantage of the latest enhancements.

WCCP Interoperability and Upgrade

Central Managers running Version 5.0.1x can manage WAEs running software Versions 4.2.1 and later.
However, we recommend that all WAEs in a given WCCP service group be running the same version.

Note

All WAEs in a WCCP service group must have the same mask, redirect, and return methods. If an
upgrade causes these values to change, upgraded WAEs are not able to rejoin the service group until all
WAEs in the group are upgraded.

To upgrade the WAEs in your WCCP service group, follow these steps:

Step 1

You must disable WCCP redirection on the Cisco IOS router first. To remove the global WCCP
configuration, use the following no ip wccp global configuration commands:

Release Note for Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software Version 5.0.1x

9

Upgrading from a Prerelease Version to Version 5.0.1x

Router(config)# no ip wccp 61
Router(config)# no ip wccp 62

Step 2

Step 3

Step 4

Step 5

Perform the WAAS software upgrade on all WAEs using the WAAS Central Manager GUI.

Verify that all WAEs have been upgraded in the Devices pane of the WAAS Central Manager GUI.
Choose Devices to view the software version of each WAE.

If mask assignment is used for WCCP, ensure that all WAEs in the service group are using the same
WCCP mask value.

Ensure that all WAEs in the service group are using the same redirect and return methods. If you are
upgrading from version 4.x to 5.x, the return method is no longer configurable and is set the same as the
redirect method. If you had been using a redirect method of L2 and a return method of GRE, this is no
longer supported and the return method is changed to L2 after the upgrade. Ensure that your router
software supports L2 return. If it does not, you can change your redirect method to GRE, which causes
the return method to change to GRE.

Step 6

Reenable WCCP redirection on the Cisco IOS routers. To enable WCCP redirection, use the ip wccp
global configuration commands:

Router(config)# ip wccp 61
Router(config)# ip wccp 62

Upgrading from a Prerelease Version to Version 5.0.1x

To upgrade from WAAS prerelease software to Version 5.0.1x, you must perform the following tasks to
ensure a successful upgrade:

(cid:129) Restore the factory default settings by using the restore factory-default command.

(cid:129) Perform a fresh install from the rescue CD or USB flash drive.

Upgrading from a Release Version to Version 5.0.1x

This section contains the following topics:

(cid:129) Requirements and Guidelines, page 10

(cid:129) Migrating a Central Manager from an Unsupported Platform, page 14

(cid:129) Ensuring a Successful RAID Pair Rebuild, page 16

For additional upgrade information and detailed procedures, refer to the Cisco Wide Area Application
Services Upgrade Guide.

Requirements and Guidelines

When you upgrade to Version 5.0.1x, observe the following guidelines and requirements:

(cid:129) Upgrading to Version 5.0.1 is supported only from Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.2.3b, 4.2.3c, 4.3.1, 4.3.3,
4.3.5a, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, 4.4.3a, 4.4.3b, 4.4.3c, 4.4.5, 4.4.7, and 4.5.1. If you want to upgrade a WAAS
device running a different version, first upgrade to the next supported version in the list, and then
upgrade to the current 5.0.1 version.

Release Note for Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software Version 5.0.1x

Upgrading from a Release Version to Version 5.0.1x

(cid:129) Upgrading to Version 5.x is not supported on the following platforms: WAE-511, WAE-512,

WAE-611, WAE-612, WAE-7326, NME-WAE-302, and NME-WAE-522. WAAS Version 5.x does
not operate on these appliances. Upgrading a device group is not allowed if the group contains any
of the unsupported devices. If you have a Central Manager running on one of these unsupported
platforms, you can migrate it to a supported platform by following the procedure in the “Migrating
a Central Manager from an Unsupported Platform” section on page 14.

(cid:129) To take advantage of new features and bug fixes, we recommend that you upgrade your entire

deployment to the latest version.

(cid:129)

If you operate a network with devices that have different software versions, the WAAS Central
Manager must be the highest version and no WAAS device should be running a version earlier than
version 4.2.1.

(cid:129) Upgrade the WAAS Central Manager devices first, and then upgrade the WAE devices. If you have
a standby WAAS Central Manager, upgrade it first, before upgrading the primary WAAS Central
Manager. After upgrading, restart any active browser connections to the WAAS Central Manager.

(cid:129) After upgrading a WAAS Central Manager, you must clear your browser cache, close the browser,

and restart the browser before reconnecting to the Central Manager.

(cid:129) Before upgrading a WAAS Central Manager to Version 5.0.1, make a database backup by using the
cms database backup EXEC command. Use the copy disk ftp EXEC command to move the backup
file to an external system. In case of any problem during the upgrade, you can restore the database
backup that you made before upgrading by using the cms database restore backup-file EXEC
command, where backup-file is the one created by the backup command.

(cid:129) After upgrading application accelerator WAEs, verify that the proper licenses are installed by using

the show license EXEC command. The Transport license is enabled by default. If any of the
application accelerators were enabled on the device before the upgrade, you should enable the
Enterprise license. Configure any additional licenses (Video and Virtual-Blade) as needed by using
the license add EXEC command. For more information on licenses, see the “Managing Software
Licenses” section in the Cisco Wide Area Application Services Configuration Guide.

(cid:129) After upgrading application accelerator WAEs, verify that the proper application accelerators,

policies, and class maps are configured. For more information on configuring accelerators, policies,
and class maps, see the “Configuring Application Acceleration” chapter in the Cisco Wide Area
Application Services Configuration Guide.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

If you are upgrading a WAAS Central Manager from a version earlier than 4.4.1 and have the secure
store enabled, you must reopen the secure store after the device reloads (and after any reload). From
the WAAS Central Manager GUI, choose Admin > Security > Secure Store or use the
cms secure-store open EXEC command. After upgrading, you can change to auto-generated
passphrase mode and you will no longer need to manually open the secure store after each reload.
For more information on using the secure store, see the “Configuring Secure Store Settings” section
in the Cisco Wide Area Application Services Configuration Guide.

If you have two Central Managers that have secure store enabled and you have switched primary and
standby roles between the two Central Managers, before upgrading the Central Managers to Version
5.0.1, you must reenter all passwords in the primary Central Manager GUI. The passwords that need
to be reentered include user passwords and CIFS file server passwords. If you do not reenter the
passwords, after upgrading to Version 5.0.1, the Central Manager fails to send configuration updates
to WAEs and the standby Central Manager until after the passwords are reentered.

If you are upgrading a Central Manager from Version 4.2.3x or earlier, and you have any scheduled
reports that are configured for more than 100 recurrences, only 100 recurrences are retained after
the upgrade.

Upgrading from a Release Version to Version 5.0.1x

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

If you use the setup utility for basic configuration after upgrading to 5.0.1, wccp router list 7 is used.
Because the setup utility is designed for use on new installations, any existing configuration for
wccp router list 7 is replaced with the new configuration.

If you have disk encryption enabled and are upgrading to Version 5.0.1 NPE from Version 4.2.1 or
earlier, disk encryption configuration as well as disk cached data are lost. There is no impact when
upgrading to standard Version 5.0.1 (non-NPE).

(cid:129) After upgrading a Central Manager from Version 4.2.3x or earlier, the AllDevicesGroup device

group is renamed to the AllWAASGroup. Additionally, an AllWAASExpressGroup is created for all
WAAS Express devices.

(cid:129) Beginning with Version 4.4.1, application-aware DRE changed the way the DRE cache is populated
and managed. When upgrading from Version 4.3.x or earlier, the existing DRE cache is preserved,
but all new cache entries are written in a new cache format. The two formats coexist until the old
cache is evicted through the normal eviction processes. DRE on a Version 5.x device is compatible
with all Version 4.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, 4.4.x, and 4.5.x peers but is not compatible with 4.0.x peers.

Application policies do not change, but the new “bidirectional” term is introduced, which is the
mode used prior to Version 4.4.1.

(cid:129) After upgrading WAAS accelerator devices from a version earlier than 4.4.1, you may be able to
improve DRE disk performance by deleting and recreating disk data partitions by using the disk
delete-data-partitions EXEC command. This command deletes the DRE and CIFS caches and all
installed virtual blade images. If you want to keep virtual blade images, back them up before using
this command by using the copy virtual-blade EXEC command.

After using the disk delete-data-partitions command, you must reload the device and the data
partitions are automatically recreated and the caches are initialized, which can take several minutes.
DRE optimization is not done until the DRE cache has finished initializing. The show statistics dre
EXEC command reports “TFO: Initializing disk cache” until then.

(cid:129) When upgrading a WAAS accelerator device from a version earlier than 4.4.1, the WCCP

load-balancing assignment method is always strictly enforced and must match the farm assignment
method or the WAAS device is not allowed to join the farm. Nonstrict assignment method is no
longer an option.

When upgrading a Central Manager from a version earlier than 4.4.1, the Only Use Selected
Assignment Method check box is no longer available in the device group WCCP Settings window.
Any WAEs in a device group that are running a version earlier than 4.4.1 and getting their WCCP
settings from the device group will not use strict assignment method enforcement. This does not
affect the WCCP farm.

(cid:129) The method for associating virtual blade interfaces to physical interfaces changed in Version 4.4.1
to use bridge groups and Bridge Virtual Interfaces (BVIs). When upgrading a device with a virtual
blade from a version earlier than 4.4.1, any virtual interface configurations are converted to use the
new bridging method.

(cid:129) Legacy mode WAFS is no longer supported in Version 4.4.1 or later and upgrading is prevented if
legacy mode WAFS is enabled (edge or core services). Legacy WAFS users must migrate to the
transparent CIFS accelerator before upgrading. For details on CIFS migration, see the Cisco Wide
Area Application Services Upgrade Guide.

(cid:129) Legacy mode print services is no longer supported in Version 4.4.1 or later. On upgrading from a
version earlier than 4.4.1, legacy print services functionality is removed and users must use the
Windows Print accelerator. The print role and print admin privileges are removed from all user
accounts, and the functionality of the Central Manager acting as a print repository is removed. Any
legacy print services jobs that are spooled are lost if an upgrade is done before the data is printed.

Release Note for Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software Version 5.0.1x

12

Upgrading from a Release Version to Version 5.0.1x

A Version 4.4.1 or later Central Manager can continue to manage earlier version WAEs that have
legacy print services enabled, but print services can be configured on these WAEs only through the
device CLI. The Central Manager also can display print services alarms from earlier version WAEs
that are running legacy print services.

(cid:129)

In WAAS versions before 4.4.5, you were able to configure more memory for virtual blades on a
294-4G platform than was supported for virtual blades. To maintain stability, after upgrading from
a version earlier than 4.4.5, all memory allocated to virtual blades on the 294-4G platform is limited
to 1 GB. This change affects any existing 294-4G virtual blade configurations.

(cid:129) Version 5.0 no longer supports device group configuration of the following features: static bypass
lists, vPath interception, and WCCP. When you are upgrading to version 5.0 from a previous version,
any device group configurations of these features are copied to the individual devices and the device
group settings are removed. WCCP settings can be copied between devices.

(cid:129) The default WCCP return method changed in WAAS version 5.0. If you are upgrading from version
4.x to 5.x, the return method is no longer configurable and is set the same as the redirect method. If
you had been using a redirect method of L2 and a return method of GRE, this is no longer supported
and the return method is changed to L2 after the upgrade. Ensure that your router software supports
L2 return. If it does not, you can change your redirect method to GRE, which sets the return method
to GRE.

(cid:129) The default WCCP egress method changed in WAAS version 5.0 and the redirect method determines
the default and available egress methods. For L2 redirect, the default egress method is set to Layer
2 and an alternate option is IP forwarding. For GRE redirect, the default egress method is IP
forwarding, and alternate options are WCCP GRE and generic GRE.

(cid:129) When upgrading from a WAAS version earlier than 5.0, you must rename classifier names that

contain a period (.) to remove the period. Classifiers with a period in their name are deleted on an
upgrade. Replace periods in classifiers with a hyphen (-) or underscore (_) to prevent deletion.

(cid:129) When upgrading from a WAAS version earlier than 5.0, pending reports are carried forward. Charts
in reports are retained if they are still available; if they are no longer available, they are migrated to
new charts. Any duplicated charts (as a result of migration) in a report are removed and all ICA
application accelerator reports are removed because they are all new in version 5.0. Custom reports
are migrated to new custom reports in a similar way. Completed reports from before the upgrade are
shown in the Completed Reports list and maintain their original format.

(cid:129) When upgrading from a WAAS version earlier than 5.0, classifiers and policies are migrated to new
version 5.0 class maps and policy rules. The same functionality is maintained, though the class map
and policy framework is different.

(cid:129) When upgrading a Central Manager from a WAAS version earlier than 5.0, the WAFS application
definition is migrated to a new CIFS application, except if a CIFS application already exists, the
application name change is not done. If you upgrade a WAE device that is not registered to a Central
Manager, the WAFS application is not renamed. Any WAAS device that is still using the WAFS
application in a policy rule after an upgrade to version 5.0 raises the following alarm: “WAFS
application is configured for optimization. Consider changing the application name to CIFS.” To
clear the alarm, you can manually change the policy rule to use the CIFS application or restore
default policies.

Release Note for Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software Version 5.0.1x

13

Upgrading from a Release Version to Version 5.0.1x

(cid:129) When upgrading from WAAS version 4.5 to version 5.0, the ICA classifiers are automatically

changed from ica and citriximaclient to class maps named Citrix-ICA and Citrix-CGP, respectively.
They are also moved to a new application named Citrix. There is no difference in functionality.

The ICA charts in WAAS version 5.0 and later are also different from those used in version 4.5. If
you are viewing the data from a version 4.5 WAAS device, the charts appear empty due to the
different data that the device is collecting. The ICA data for version 4.5 WAAS devices is available
in the system level TCP Summary Report by selecting the Remote-Desktop application.

(cid:129) When you upgrade from WAAS, version 4.x, you must reconfigure the custom EPM policy for a
device or device group.  You must first restore the default policy setting by selecting the Restore
default Optimization Policies link for the device group in the Modifying Device Group window
and then reconfigure your custom policy rules for the device.

Migrating a Central Manager from an Unsupported Platform

If you have a WAAS Central Manager that is running on a hardware platform that is unsupported in
version 5.0 (such as a WAE-511/512/611/612/7326), you are not allowed to upgrade the device to
version 5.0. You must migrate the Central Manager to a supported platform by following the procedure
in this section, which preserves all of the Central Manager configuration and database information.

Follow these steps to migrate a primary Central Manager to a new WAAS device:

Step 1

From the primary Central Manager CLI, create a database backup by using the cms database backup
EXEC command. Move the backup file to a separate device by using the copy disk ftp command.

CM# cms database backup
Creating database backup file cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15.dump
Backup file cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15 is ready.
Please use `copy' commands to move the backup file to a remote host.
CM# copy disk ftp 10.11.5.5 / cm-backup.dump cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15.dump

Step 2

Display and write down the IP address and netmask of the Central Manager.

CM# show running-config interface
primary-interface GigabitEthernet 1/0
!
interface GigabitEthernet 1/0
 ip address 10.10.10.25 255.255.255.0
 exit
interface GigabitEthernet 2/0
 shutdown
 exit
!

Step 3

Shut down all the interfaces on the primary Central Manager.

CM# configure
CM(config) interface GigabitEthernet 1/0 shutdown

Step 4

Replace the existing Central Manager device with a new hardware platform that can support WAAS
version 5.0. Ensure that the new Central Manager device is running the same software version as the old
Central Manager.

Step 5

Configure the new Central Manager with the same IP address and netmask as the old Central Manager.
You can do this in the setup utility or by using the interface global configuration command.

newCM# configure
newCM(config) interface GigabitEthernet 1/0 ip address 10.10.10.25 255.255.255.0

Upgrading from a Release Version to Version 5.0.1x

Step 6

Copy the backup file created in Step 1 from the FTP server to the new Central Manager.

newCM# copy ftp disk 10.11.5.5 / cm-backup.dump cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15.dump

Step 7

Restore the database backup on the new Central Manager by using the cms database restore command.
Use option 1 to restore all CLI configurations.

newCM# cms database restore cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15.dump
Backup database version is from an earlier version than the current software version.
Restored data will be automatically upgraded when cms services are enabled.

restore procedure.
Database files and node identity information successfully restored from file
`cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15.dump'

Step 8

Enable the CMS service.

newCM# configure
newCM(config) cms enable

Step 9

Step 10

Verify that the Central Manager GUI is accessible and all WAAS devices are shown in an online state in
the Devices window.

(Optional) If you have a standby Central Manager that is running on unsupported hardware and is
registered to the primary Central Manager, deregister the standby Central Manager.

standbyCM# cms deregister

Step 11 Upgrade the primary Central Manager to WAAS version 5.0.x. You can use the Central Manager

Software Update window or the copy ftp install command.

Step 12 Verify that the Central Manager GUI is accessible and all WAAS devices are shown in an online state in

the Devices window.

Step 13

(Optional) Register a new standby Central Manager that is running WAAS version 5.0.x.

newstandbyCM# configure
newstandbyCM(config)# device mode central-manager
newstandbyCM(config)# exit
newstandbyCM# reload

Downgrading from Version 5.0.1x to a Previous Version

Ensuring a Successful RAID Pair Rebuild

RAID pairs rebuild on the next reboot after you use the restore factory-default command, replace or
add a hard disk drive, delete disk partitions, or reinstall WAAS from the booted recovery CD-ROM.

Caution

You must ensure that all RAID pairs are done rebuilding before you reboot your WAE device. If you
reboot while the device is rebuilding, you risk corrupting the file system.

To view the status of the drives and check if the RAID pairs are in “NORMAL OPERATION” or in
“REBUILDING” status, use the show disk details command in EXEC mode. When you see that RAID
is rebuilding, you must let it complete that rebuild process. This rebuild process may take several hours.

If you do not wait for the RAID pairs to complete the rebuild process before you reboot the device, you
may see the following symptoms that could indicate a problem:

(cid:129) The device is offline in the Central Manager GUI.

(cid:129) CMS cannot be loaded.

(cid:129) Error messages say that the file system is read-only.

(cid:129) The syslog contains errors such as “Aborting journal on device md2,” “Journal commit I/O error,”

“Journal has aborted,” or “ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory.”

(cid:129) Other unusual behaviors occur that are related to disk operations or the inability to perform them.

If you encounter any of these symptoms, reboot the WAE device and wait until the RAID rebuild finishes
normally.

Downgrading from Version 5.0.1x to a Previous Version

Note the following guidelines and considerations for downgrading:

(cid:129) Downgrade is supported only to versions 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.2.3b, 4.2.3c, 4.3.1, 4.3.3, 4.3.5a, 4.4.1, 4.4.3,
4.4.3a, 4.4.3b, 4.4.3c, 4.4.5, 4.4.7, and 4.5.1. Downgrade is not supported to versions 4.1.x and
4.0.x.

(cid:129) On a vWAAS device you cannot downgrade to a version earlier than 4.3.1.

(cid:129) On WAVE-294/594/694/7541/7571/8541 models you cannot downgrade to a version earlier than

4.4.1.

(cid:129) When downgrading WAAS devices, first downgrade application accelerator WAEs, then the standby

Central Manager (if you have one), and lastly the primary Central Manager.

(cid:129)

If you have a standby Central Manager, it must be registered to the primary Central Manager before
the downgrade.

(cid:129) When downgrading an AppNav Controller device to a version earlier than 5.0.1 you must deregister
the device from the Central Manager, change the device mode to application-accelerator, downgrade
the device, and then reregister the device after the downgrade (or you can reregister the device before
downgrading). If you do not deregister the device before downgrading, the device goes offline and
the device mode is not set correctly. In that case, use the cms deregister force EXEC command to
deregister the device and then reregister it by using the cms enable global configuration command.

If the AppNav Controller device contains an AppNav Controller Interface Module, the module is not
recognized by WAAS versions earlier than 5.0.1 and is nonfunctional after a downgrade.

Release Note for Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software Version 5.0.1x

16

Downgrading from Version 5.0.1x to a Previous Version

(cid:129) When downgrading from a WAAS NPE version to a version earlier than 4.2.3, the show version last

command does not display NPE in the version output.

(cid:129)

If downgrading to Version 4.2.1, you must first change the password for WCCP, SNMP user,
RADIUS, TACACS, or transaction log modules before the downgrade if any of the special
characters !@#$%\ were used in the password for the module. Otherwise, the related CLI commands
for those modules fail.

(cid:129) Locked-out user accounts are reset upon a downgrade.

(cid:129) Any reports and charts that are not supported in the downgrade version are removed from managed
and scheduled reports when you downgrade to an earlier version. Any pending reports that were
carried forward from an upgrade from a version earlier than 5.0 are maintained.

(cid:129) After downgrading a Central Manager to a version earlier than 4.3.1, the AllWAASGroup device
group is renamed to the AllDevicesGroup. Additionally, the AllWAASExpressGroup is removed.

(cid:129) After downgrading a Central Manager to a version earlier than 4.3.1, all registered WAAS Express
devices are deleted from the Central Manager. If the Central Manager is later upgraded to 4.3.1,
WAAS Express devices must be registered again.

(cid:129) When downgrading to a version earlier than 4.4.1, the DRE cache is cleared and the DRE caching
mode for all application policies is changed to bidirectional (the only available mode prior to 4.4.1).
Before downgrading a WAE, we recommend that you use the Central Manager GUI to change all
policies that are using the new Unidirectional or Adaptive caching modes to the Bidirectional
caching mode.

(cid:129) When downgrading a Central Manager to a version earlier than 4.4.1, if the secure store is in

auto-passphrase mode, downgrade is not allowed. You must switch to user-passphrase mode before
you can downgrade to a software version that does not support auto-passphrase mode.

(cid:129) Prior to downgrading to a version earlier than 4.4.1, we recommend that you change the WCCP

service IDs back to their default values of 61 and 62, and change the failure detection timeout back
to the default value of 30 seconds, if you have changed these values. Only these default values are
supported in versions prior to 4.4.1 and any other values are lost after the downgrade. If a WAE is
registered to a Central Manager, it is configured with the default service IDs of 61 and 62 after it is
downgraded and comes back online.

(cid:129) Current BMC settings are erased and restored to factory-default when you downgrade WAAS to a

version earlier than 4.4.5.

To downgrade the WAAS Central Manager (not required for WAE devices), follow these steps:

Step 1

(Optional) From the Central Manager CLI, create a database backup by using the cms database backup
EXEC command. Move the backup file to a separate device by using the copy disk ftp command.

CM# cms database backup
Creating database backup file cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15.dump
Backup file cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15 is ready.
Please use `copy' commands to move the backup file to a remote host.
CM# copy disk ftp 10.11.5.5 / 06-28-backup.dump cms-db-06-28-2012-15-08_5.0.1.0.15.dump

Step 2

Install the downgrade WAAS software image by using the copy ftp install EXEC command.

CM# copy ftp install 10.11.5.5 waas/4.4 waas-universal-4.4.5c.4-k9.bin

Step 3

Reload the device.

Cisco WAE and WAVE Appliance Boot Process

Downgrading the database may trigger full updates for registered devices. In the Central Manager GUI,
ensure that all previously operational devices come online.

Cisco WAE and WAVE Appliance Boot Process

To monitor the boot process on Cisco WAE and WAVE appliances, connect to the serial console port on
the appliance as directed in the Hardware Installation Guide.

Cisco WAE and WAVE appliances may have video connectors that should not be used in a normal
operation. The video output is for troubleshooting purposes only during BIOS boot and stops displaying
output as soon as the serial port becomes active.

Central Manager Report Scheduling

In the WAAS Central Manager, we recommend running system wide reports in device groups of 250
devices or less, or scheduling these reports at different time intervals, so multiple system wide reports
are not running simultaneously.

WAAS Express Policy Changes

Making policy changes to large numbers of WAAS Express devices from the Central Manager may take
longer than making policy changes to WAAS devices.

Virtual Blade Configuration From File

If you copy the device configuration to the running-config from a file (for example, with the copy
startup-config running-config command), configuration changes from the file are applied to the device
without confirmation. If a virtual blade disk configuration exists in the configuration file and it is
different from the actual device configuration, the device virtual blade disk configuration is removed and
replaced with the disk configuration from the file. You lose all data on the virtual blade disks.

Release Note for Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software Version 5.0.1x

Software Version 5.0.1 Resolved and Open Caveats, and Command Changes

Using Autoregistration with Port-Channel and Standby Interfaces

Autoregistration is designed to operate on the first network interface and will not work if this interface
is part of a port-channel or standby. Do not enable the auto-register global configuration command when
the interface is configured as part of a port-channel or standby group.

Disabling WCCP from the Central Manager

If you use the Central Manager to disable WCCP on a WAAS device, the Central Manager immediately
shuts down WCCP and closes any existing connections, ignoring the setting configured by the
wccp shutdown max-wait global configuration command (however, it warns you). If you want to
gracefully shut down WCCP connections, use the no enable WCCP configuration command on the
WAAS device.

Changing Device Mode To or From Central Manager Mode

If you change the device mode to or from Central Manager mode, the DRE cache is erased.

TACACS+ Authentication and Default User Roles

If you are using TACACS+ authentication we recommend that you do not assign any roles to the default
user ID, which has no roles assigned by default. If you assign any roles to the default user, external users
that are authenticated by TACACS+ and who do not have the waas_rbac_groups attribute defined in
TACACS+ (meaning they are not assigned to any group) can gain access to all the roles that are assigned
to the default user.

Internet Explorer Certificate Request

If you use Internet Explorer to access the Central Manager GUI version 4.3.1 or later and Internet
Explorer has personal certificates installed, the browser prompts you to choose a certificate from the list
of those installed in the personal certificate store. The certificate request occurs to support WAAS
Express registration and is ignored by Internet Explorer if no personal certificates are installed. Click
OK or Cancel in the certificate dialog to continue to the Central Manager log in page. To avoid this
prompt, remove the installed personal certificates or use a different browser.

Software Version 5.0.1 Resolved and Open Caveats, and

Using Previous Client Code

If you have upgraded to WAAS version 5.0.1 and are using the WSDL2Java tool to generate client stubs
that enforce strict binding, earlier version client code (prior to 4.3.1) may return unexpected exceptions
due to new elements added in the response structures in 4.3.1 and later releases. The observed symptom
is an exception related to an unexpected subelement because of the new element (for example, a
deviceName element) in the XML response.

To work around this problem, we recommend that you patch the WSDL2Java tool library to silently
consume exceptions if new elements are found in XML responses and then regenerate the client stubs.
This approach avoids future problems if the API is enhanced with new elements over time.

You must modify the ADBBeanTemplate.xsl file in the axis2-adb-codegen-version.jar file.

To apply the patch, follow these steps:

Step 1

List the files in the axis2-adb-codegen-version.jar file:

# jar tf axis2-adb-codegen-1.3.jar

Step 2

Change the ADBBeanTemplate.xsl file by commenting out the following exceptions so that the
generated code consumes the exceptions:

<xsl:if test="$ordered and $min!=0">

else{

// A start element we are not expecting indicates an invalid parameter was passed
// throw new org.apache.axis2.databinding.ADBException("Unexpected subelement " +

reader.getLocalName());

}

</xsl:if>

. . .

while (!reader.isStartElement() &amp;&amp; !reader.isEndElement())

reader.next();

//if (reader.isStartElement())

// A start element we are not expecting indicates a trailing invalid property
// throw new org.apache.axis2.databinding.ADBException("Unexpected subelement " +
