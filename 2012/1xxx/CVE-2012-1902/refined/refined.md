Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `show_config_errors.php` script in phpMyAdmin did not validate the existence of the configuration file (`CONFIG_FILE`) before attempting to include it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** If the configuration file was not present or readable, the script would generate an error message that included the full path to the configuration file. This was due to the use of `require CONFIG_FILE;` outside the `is_readable()` check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially learn the full server path to the phpMyAdmin configuration file. This information could be used in further attacks if the attacker knew the default location of the configuration file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker could access the vulnerable `show_config_errors.php` script directly through a web browser or other HTTP client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
*   **Basic knowledge of default paths:** Knowing the standard path of phpMyAdmin configuration files could be helpful to use the revealed path information.
*   **PHP configuration:** The `php.ini` must have `error_reporting` set to `E_ALL` and `display_errors` set to `On` for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "non-critical" due to the requirement that `display_errors` is enabled in `php.ini`, which is not recommended for production environments.
*   The fix involved adding a check using `is_readable(CONFIG_FILE)` before the `require` statement.
*   The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 3.4.x.
*   The commit `c51817d3b8cb05ff54dca9373c0667e29b8498d4` contains the fix.
*   The issue was reported by Mateusz Goik from AliantSoft.
