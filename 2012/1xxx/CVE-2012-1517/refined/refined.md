- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw exists in the handler function for RPC commands, allowing manipulation of function pointers within the VMX process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a memory overwrite, specifically related to function pointers, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A guest user can potentially crash the VMX process or execute code on the host.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious guest user through RPC commands to the VMX process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious user requires the ability to execute code within a guest VM and send RPC commands to the host. Root or administrator privileges are not required to exploit the vulnerability.
