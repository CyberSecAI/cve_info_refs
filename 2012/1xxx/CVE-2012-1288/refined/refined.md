Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock has hardcoded default administrator login credentials.
*   These credentials cannot be changed by an administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of static, unchangeable default credentials for administrative access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain access to the device's web interface.
*   **Configuration Changes:** The attacker can view and change system configuration files.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify other sensitive data.
*  **Complete Compromise:** The CVSS base score indicates high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to attempt exploitation.
*  **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface (typically port 80/tcp).
*  **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must know the default, hardcoded username and password to login.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected device is a master clock that can synchronize up to 60,000 slave clocks.
*   The document provides a temporary workaround (blocking web interface) which would prevent remote exploitation at the cost of administrator usability.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2012-1288.
