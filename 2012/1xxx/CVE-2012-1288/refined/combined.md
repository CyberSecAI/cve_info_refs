### Overview

UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock have default administrator login credentials that can not be modified by an administrator.

### Description

| UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock via Zigbee can sync up to 60,000 slave clocks located throughout a campus-area network. An administrator will typically log into the device by supplying credentials to a web-interface. These devices contain a consistent, hardcoded administrative username and password that cannot be changed by the administrator. |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Do not allow access to the web interface of the UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock from untrusted networks.**Block Access to the Web Interface**Blocking access to port 80/tcp will prevent any user, even authorized administrators, from logging into the web-interface, but will not interfere with the UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock slave clock syncing. |
