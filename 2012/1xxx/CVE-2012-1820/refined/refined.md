          "root_cause": "A flaw exists in `bgp_capability_orf()` which parses ORF capability TLV. This function uses a do-while loop and calls the helper function `bgp_capability_orf_entry()`. The check in `bgp_capability_orf_entry()` verifies if the 'Number of ORFs' field fits the input buffer based on the total length of the ORF TLV, but not on data already consumed by previous helper calls. This makes the check condition only valid for the first AFI/SAFI block, leading to a potential buffer overrun for subsequent calls.",
