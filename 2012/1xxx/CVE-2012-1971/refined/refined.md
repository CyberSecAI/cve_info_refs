Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities and related information:

**CVE-2012-1971**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The provided data does not specify the exact root cause for CVE-2012-1971. Instead, it mentions that it is related to "memory safety issues affecting Firefox" along with CVE-2012-1970. This is a very broad description, and no specific information is given about what function or code area the vulnerability is located in
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Memory safety issues. From the Ubuntu notice, "If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox." 
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service via application crash
    *   Potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Opening a specially crafted web page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to host/deliver a specially crafted web page and convince a user to open it using Firefox.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-1548-1, USN-1548-2):** This notice bundles multiple CVEs, including CVE-2012-1971, into a single update. It broadly describes the vulnerability as memory safety issues that could lead to denial of service or code execution. A regression was introduced during a previous update (USN-1548-1) that leaked browsing history, which was then fixed by the update (USN-1548-2).
*   **Mozilla Security Advisory 2012-57:** This advisory also groups multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2012-1971. It states these are "several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products" which under "certain circumstances" may be used to "run arbitrary code" and lead to browser crashes. It also specifies that these issues "cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
*   **Bugzilla entries:**
   * There is a list of 14 bugs which are all related to CVE-2012-1971 (719750, 748119, 749039, 754150, 754242, 732870, 752038, 753162, 755916, 780712, 730208, 779849, 752087, 765936). The bugs highlight many underlying issues relating to the incorrect management of JS objects within different compartments that lead to a crash, an assertion failure, or some form of memory corruption.
   * **Bug 753162** is an assertion failure due to "compartment mismatch" triggered during DOMAttrModified and document.write, which was caused by the code assuming that the AutoCompartment scope was always restored to the same compartment it had when called, which was not always true. The patch fixes this by not assuming that the scope will be the same after entering.
   * **Bug 749039** is due to the program having a pointer from the interpreter to a function being executed by the methodjit, and if the methodjit throws or exits and a GC happens it might not have marked the objects before the return, which results in the pointers becoming garbage and a crash. The fix is to ensure that all FrameRegs are correct on all paths that exit the methodjit.
    *   **Bug 773097** is a crash related to the graphics library, where the crash was happening in the destructor of gfxContext or related code. This crash was related to how canvases interacted with accelerated layer managers. The fix was to avoid using GetCanvasLayer for creating surfaces and to also create a test suite for preventing the issue from reoccurring. 
    *   **Bug 730208** was a hunt for "black -> gray edges" that appeared in the JS heap. They identified multiple places where C++ code was passing gray JS objects back into JSAPI without unmarking them and thus causing corruption, and the fix consisted of ensuring objects are properly blacked when needed.
    *  **Bug 754150** is an assertion due to the need for read barriers on TypeObjects and JSObjects stored in Types, since they can be destroyed during a GC slice, along with the fix for the assertion which is to add these read barriers
    *  **Bug 754242** is a memory corruption issue involving a missing reset of the incremental GC when a new compartment is added in the middle of a GC. The fix is to add a conditional check to reset the incremental GC when needed.
    * **Bug 719750** is an assertion failure when a specific type was not pushed when a destructuring assignment was happening. The fix was a change in how destructuring assigment was handled, but no patch is provided.
   *  **Bug 779849** is a flash plugin related crash that highlights a problem with how some code that is called when unloading a flash plugin creates a cross-compartment wrapper. The fix was to ensure all pointers are handled the same way and that there is no compartment mismatch.
    * **Bug 752087** is a crash happening when using JSObject or calling GetNativeOfWrapper with a bad argument (i.e. null). The fix is to add additional checks on JS object parameters so that it does not try to operate on a null value.

**Summary of Findings:**

The information provided suggests that CVE-2012-1971 is related to a set of complex memory safety issues within Firefox's JavaScript engine and other core components. It's clear that multiple developers were involved in identifying, debugging, and fixing these bugs.  These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to cause denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on a user's machine by luring them into opening specially crafted web pages. It is also highlighted that many of the issues are not exploitable through the email client functionality of Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, but are still present in browser and browser-like contexts within these programs.

**Note:** The provided Bugzilla entries offer a lot of technical context, but they do not point to a singular, easily described root cause for CVE-2012-1971. Rather it highlights a series of related issues which are all categorized by Mozilla under that CVE.
