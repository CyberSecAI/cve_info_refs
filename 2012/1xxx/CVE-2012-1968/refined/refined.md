Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1968:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper permission check within Bugzilla's HTML bugmail functionality. When generating HTML emails, the system was validating user permissions based on the user who made the bug change, rather than the recipient of the email. This flawed logic meant that sensitive information about restricted bugs or attachments could be exposed to recipients who lacked the necessary permissions to view them normally.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to correctly verify if the email recipient had the right permissions to access the linked bug or attachment. The system was using the wrong user context for the permission check.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability led to an information leak where users could gain access to bug summaries and attachment descriptions that they shouldn't have been able to see. This information was exposed via tooltips displayed when hovering over links in HTML emails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Data Exposure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information about bugs, including details of security vulnerabilities, which might not be publicly accessible.
*   **Breach of Confidentiality:** The primary impact is the exposure of private bug details to unauthorized individuals, potentially revealing details about vulnerabilities or internal projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Bugmails:** The vulnerability is triggered when HTML emails are sent through the bug tracking system. These emails contain links to bugs and attachments which, due to the vulnerability, reveal information to unauthorized recipients when hovered over.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Bugzilla:** The attacker must be a user of the Bugzilla system and must be a recipient of a HTML bugmail from the system. They could be a user with restricted permissions.
*   **Knowledge of the System:**  While no specific knowledge of system vulnerabilities is needed to exploit, the user would need to be in a position to receive emails from the Bugzilla instance to be able to view the disclosed information.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Bugzilla versions 4.1.1 to 4.3.1
*   The fix involves checking the permissions of the *recipient* of the email, rather than the *sender* of the email, when generating the links for the HTML bugmails.
*   Plain text bugmails are not affected.
*   The bug report also mentions a related issue (CVE-2012-1969) where private attachment descriptions are visible when mentioned in a public comment, highlighting that private attachment information was generally not well protected within the system before the fix.
