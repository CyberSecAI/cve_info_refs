- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Microsoft SharePoint does not properly validate specially crafted URLs, allowing redirection to external sites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** URL redirection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect a user from a legitimate SharePoint site to a malicious external website, which could be designed to impersonate the targeted SharePoint site, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to click on a specially crafted URL that directs the user to the targeted SharePoint site, which will then redirect the user to an external URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and social engineer the victim into clicking the link.
