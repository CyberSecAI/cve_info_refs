Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1184:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow occurs within the `ast_parse_digest` function of the Asterisk Manager Interface when processing HTTP Digest Authentication headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `ast_parse_digest` function doesn't properly validate the length of values within the HTTP Digest Authentication header. Specifically, when parsing the header, an arbitrarily long string value can be sent, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the Asterisk application.
- There is also a possibility of arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can send a specially crafted HTTP Digest Authentication header with excessively long string values to the Asterisk Manager Interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the HTTP session of the Asterisk Manager Interface.
- No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Asterisk versions 1.8.x before 1.8.10.1 and 10.x before 10.2.1.
- The fix involves properly handling and validating the input strings to prevent the buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability is identified as AST-2012-003 in Asterisk's security advisories.
- Patches are available for both the 1.8 and 10 branches of Asterisk.
- The issue is also tracked in Gentoo Bugzilla under bug ID 408431 and Red Hat Bugzilla under bug ID 804042.
- The vulnerability was reported by Russell Bryant.
