{
  "CVE-2012-1137": {
    "Description": "An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine performed loading and parsing of file header information for glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF) font files. A remote attacker could provide a BDF font file with specially-crafted BDF header, which once processed in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that application crash.",
    "Root cause": "An off-by-one heap-based buffer over-read in the `_bdf_list_ensure()` function of the FreeType library when parsing a malformed BDF font file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read",
      "Improper Input Validation"
     ],
    "Impact": "Application crash, potentially arbitrary code execution with user privileges.",
    "Attack vector": "By enticing a user to open a specially crafted BDF font file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a user with a maliciously crafted BDF font file."
