{
  "CVE-2012-1187": {
    "Description": "Bitlbee does not drop extra group privileges correctly in unix.c",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Bitlbee was using setgid() followed by setuid() to drop privileges, which is insufficient. It needs to also drop the extra groups that the process was started with.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Incomplete privilege dropping"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A process might retain extra group privileges even after it attempts to drop them, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unintended access.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system where bitlbee is running.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with or influence the bitlbee process.",
    "Additional Information": "The fix for this issue involves using initgroups() to drop the extra groups. This was corrected in upstream changeset r856."
