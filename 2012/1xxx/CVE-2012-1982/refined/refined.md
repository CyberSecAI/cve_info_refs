- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization of the `TR_title` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious code injected into the `TR_title` parameter is stored and executed when other users/administrators view the affected page.
    - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The injected malicious code is executed immediately for the user inputting the malicious data.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites or theft of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - HTTP POST request to `my_admin/admin1_list_pages.php` for persistent XSS.
    - User inputs malicious data directly into the `TR_title` field for reflected XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to publish articles to exploit the persistent XSS.
    - For reflected XSS, an attacker simply needs to insert the malicious code into the title field.
