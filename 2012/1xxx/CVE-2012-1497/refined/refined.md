Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed in Movable Type versions 5.13, 5.07, and 4.38:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerabilities stem from multiple issues within the Movable Type application, including:
* Insecure handling of file uploads and management.
* Improper session management in commenting and community scripts.
* Insufficient output escaping in templates and mt-wizard.cgi.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **OS Command Injection:**  The file management system allows for the injection of OS commands.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Vulnerabilities exist in commenting and community scripts that allow session hijacking.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  Vulnerabilities exist in commenting and community scripts, allowing for CSRF attacks.
*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
    *   Improper escaping of variables in templates leads to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   `mt-wizard.cgi` contains XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Local File Inclusion**: A user with specific privileges can read files on the local filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server by exploiting the OS command injection vulnerability.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can take over user sessions, potentially gaining access to sensitive information and administrative functions.
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Through XSS, attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, which can lead to data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*  **Reading Arbitrary files:** An attacker with specific privileges can read sensitive files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Uploads:** Attackers could exploit the file management system by uploading malicious files.
*   **Commenting and Community Scripts:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in these scripts to perform session hijacking and CSRF attacks.
*   **Templates:** Attackers can inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages through unescaped variables in templates.
*   **mt-wizard.cgi:** Attackers can inject malicious client-side scripts into the page served by `mt-wizard.cgi`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For OS command injection, the attacker requires the ability to sign in to the admin script and upload files.
*   For session hijacking and CSRF, the attacker needs to target a user who is logged in and using the vulnerable commenting or community scripts.
*   For XSS, attackers need to inject malicious code into templates or mt-wizard.cgi which will then be executed by other users' browsers.
*   For local file inclusion, the attacker needs "Create Entries" or "Manage Blog" permissions.

**Additional Information**
* The update disables the `mt:Include file="XXX"` attribute by default to prevent arbitrary file access.
* The update adds `.pm .so .rb .htc` to the `DeniedAssetFileExtensions` list.
* The vulnerabilities were discovered through an internal security audit and a report by Trustwave (TWSL2012-003).
* The advisory includes the specific versions that address the issues for Debian (4.3.8+dfsg-0+squeeze2 for stable, and 5.1.3+dfsg-1 for testing and unstable).

This information provides a clear picture of the security issues, their potential impact, and how they can be exploited.
