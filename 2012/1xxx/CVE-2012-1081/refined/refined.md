This content is related to CVE-2012-1081. It is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities found in third-party TYPO3 extensions, published on February 2, 2012. This advisory provides a detailed breakdown of each vulnerability, affected extensions, and recommended solutions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

The advisory lists multiple vulnerabilities across various third-party TYPO3 extensions. These include:

*   **SQL Injection:** This vulnerability exists in the `mv_cooking`, `toi_category`, `mm_whtppr`, `rtg_files` and `bc_post2facebook` extensions. It can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability appears in extensions like `toi_category`, `rtg_files`, `bc_post2facebook`, `css_filelinks`, `irfaq`, `skt_eurocalc`, `ya_googlesearch`, `terminal`, `beuserswitch`, `jftcaforms`, and `aeurltool`. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The `sysutils` and `beuserswitch` extensions have information disclosure vulnerabilities.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `typo3_webservice` extension has this critical vulnerability that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Open Redirection:** This vulnerability is present in the `irfaq` extension, and allows attackers to redirect users to arbitrary websites.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The `terminal` extension is vulnerable to CSRF, which can allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user.

**Affected Extensions and Versions:**

The following extensions and their vulnerable versions are specified:

*   `mv_cooking`: 0.4.0 and below
*   `toi_category`: 0.6.0 and below
*   `mm_whtppr`: 0.0.4 and below
*   `rtg_files`: 1.5.1 and below
*  `bc_post2facebook`: 0.2.1 and below
*   `sysutils`: 1.0.3 and below
*   `typo3_webservice`: 0.3.7 and below
*   `css_filelinks`: 0.2.18 and below
*   `irfaq`: 1.1.2 and below
*   `skt_eurocalc`: 0.0.1
*   `ya_googlesearch`: 0.3.9 and below
*   `terminal`: 0.3.2 and below
*   `beuserswitch`: 0.0.1
*   `jftcaforms`: 0.2.0 and below
*   `aeurltool`: 0.1.0

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact varies depending on the vulnerability type:

*   **SQL Injection:** Full database compromise, data theft, data modification, or complete loss of data.
*   **XSS:** Session hijacking, information theft, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Leakage of sensitive data.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Full system compromise.
*   **Open Redirection:** Redirecting users to phishing sites or other malicious resources.
*   **CSRF:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a victim user.

**Attack Vectors and Required Capabilities:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** All vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely (AV:N), often without requiring authentication (Au:N).
*   **Moderate Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity (AC:M) is rated moderate for most vulnerabilities, suggesting they may require specific conditions or user interaction to exploit.
*   For the `typo3_webservice` extension, the CVSS vector suggests a successful attack requires a user with some level of authentication (Au:S), indicating that administrative or other privileged access to the system might be required to fully execute the attack.

**Solutions:**

The advisory provides specific solutions for each affected extension:

*   **Updates Available:** Some extensions have updated versions available via the TYPO3 extension manager. These include `mv_cooking`, `rtg_files`, `bc_post2facebook`, `sysutils`, `typo3_webservice`, `css_filelinks`, `irfaq`, `ya_googlesearch` and `jftcaforms`
*   **Extension Removal:** For extensions where no update is provided, or the author failed to respond, the advisory recommends uninstalling and deleting the extension folder. This applies to `toi_category`, `mm_whtppr`, `skt_eurocalc`, `terminal`, `beuserswitch`, and `aeurltool`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the `mv_cooking` vulnerability is known to be exploited in the wild.
*   It also notes that some vulnerable extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the lack of timely security fixes by their authors.
*   The advisory advises users to subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security bulletins and recommends following the TYPO3 Security Guide.
