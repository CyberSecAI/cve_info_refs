util: never follow symlinks in rm\_rf\_children()The function checks if the entry is a directory before recursing, but
there is a window between the check and the open, during which the
directory could be replaced with a symlink.

Subject: [Notification] CVE-2012-1174 systemd: TOCTOU race condition by removing
 user session

Hello vendors,

   this is to inform you about the following flaw in systemd:

A TOCTOU race condition was found in the way the systemd-logind login manager
of the systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, performed removal of
particular records related with user session upon user logout. A local attacker
could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, potentially leading to
removal of arbitrary system file.

Upstream patch:
[1] <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=5ebff5337594d690b322078c512eb222d34aaa82>

Red Hat Bugzilla entry:
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-1174>

Credit: Issue reported by Michal Schmidt of Red Hat.

Flaw turnaround time: 16 days

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-14 14:27:45 UTC  ``` A TOCTOU race condition was found in the way the systemd-logind login manager of the systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, performed removal of particular records related with user session upon user logout. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, potentially leading to removal of arbitrary system file.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-14 14:33:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 570001](attachment.cgi?id=570001&action=diff "Proposed patch from Michal Schmidt, original issue reporter") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=570001&action=edit "Proposed patch from Michal Schmidt, original issue reporter") Proposed patch from Michal Schmidt, original issue reporter   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-14 14:33:54 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the systemd package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-14 14:34:24 UTC  ``` The preliminary embargo date for this issue has been set up to this Friday, 2012-03-16.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-14 14:37:52 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-1174](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1174) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c7)  Michal Schmidt    2012-03-14 15:08:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c3)) > This issue affects the versions of the systemd package, as shipped with Fedora > release of 15 and 16.  Just a note: The above sentence is correct, even though F15 does not contain the systemd-logind daemon. In F15 the vulnerable code is called from the PAM module instead. I haven't tried exploiting it on F15, but I see nothing that would make it impossible.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-16 15:11:33 UTC  ``` Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 804118](show_bug.cgi?id=804118 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1174 systemd (systemd-logind): TOCTOU race condition by removing user session [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c11)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-16 17:43:46 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: [1] <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=5ebff5337594d690b322078c512eb222d34aaa82>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=803358#c12)  Fedora Update System    2012-03-26 03:54:45 UTC  ``` systemd-26-18.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.
