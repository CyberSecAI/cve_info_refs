Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-1948:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is identified as memory safety issues in the browser engine used by Firefox and other Mozilla products like Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. The reports suggest that these issues could lead to memory corruption. Specifically, it was found that a Javascript: URL could be used to execute code with elevated privilege. Additionally there was a problem with WebGL uniform array setters leading to possible buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory safety bugs in the browser engine.
- Arbitrary code execution through javascript: URLs.
- Potential for buffer overflows via WebGL uniform array setters
- Issues where the driver can cause a crash due to an unhandled case.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service via application crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the browser, sometimes with elevated privileges.
- Potential for unauthorized access to user data or resources.
- Memory corruption issues.
- Security bypass through improper handling of URL types.

**Attack vectors:**
- Tricking a user into opening a specially crafted web page.
- Exploiting specific APIs like the WebGL uniform array setters.
- Triggering Javascript URL code.
- The use of drag and drop with the address bar

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft malicious web pages containing javascript payloads, or specially crafted data for WebGL calls.
- Ability to lure the victim to visit the malicious web page.
- Sometimes this is exploitable through Javascript: URLs
- In some cases, code can escape the sandbox.
