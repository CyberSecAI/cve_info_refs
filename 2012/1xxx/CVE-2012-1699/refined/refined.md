```
{
  "Root cause": "The X11R6 font server code in xfs, when handling the SetEventMask request, passes an invalid event mask to the SendErrToClient() function.  SendErrToClient() expects a pointer, but was being passed the raw mask value.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Incorrect pointer usage",
     "Insufficient input validation"
  ],
  "Impact": "Denial of service (segfault) or information leak by reading arbitrary memory locations.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted SetEventMask request to the xfs font server with an invalid event mask.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the X Font Server (xfs)."
