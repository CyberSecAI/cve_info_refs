Hash: SHA1

X.Org security advisory, July 24, 2012
Denial of Service & Information leak in xfs prior to X11R6.7/XFree86 3.3.3
CVE IDs: CVE-2012-1699

Description
- -----------

A vulnerability has been found in the X11R6 font server code in the
handling of the SetEventMask request in xfs - if an invalid mask is
specified, it passes that bad mask to the SendErrToClient() function
for returning to the client in the error message.  Unfortunately,
SendErrToClient() expects a pointer, but was being passed the raw
mask value, causing it to use the mask as a pointer, either segfaulting
(if that happened to be an invalid pointer), or returning whatever data
happened to be accessible in the 4 bytes at the address specified by
the mask value.

Affected Versions
- -----------------

X11R6 through X11R6.6 appear to be vulnerable.   The fix shown below was
introduced by XFree86 in their 3.3.3 release as part of the commit for:
   Prototype/ansification cleanup for Xserver/XIE, xfs, fontlib, mkfontdir,
   and fix some bugs found along the way (#2103, Thomas Dickey).

X11R6.7 incorporated the XFree86 changes, and thus X11R6.7 and later releases
from X.Org are not vulnerable.

Workaround
- ----------

Disable the xfs font server on machines where it is not required and only
older versions of the software are available.

Fix
- ---

Vendors still supporting xfs from a release prior to either X11R6.7
or XFree86 3.3.3 should upgrade to a non-vulnerable release if possible.
If upgrade is not possible, the fix is trivial, pass an address where one
is expected in difs/events.c:

 int
 ProcSetEventMask(ClientPtr client)
 {
     REQUEST(fsSetEventMaskReq);
     REQUEST_AT_LEAST_SIZE(fsSetEventMaskReq);

     if (stuff->event_mask & ~AllEventMasks) {
- -       SendErrToClient(client, FSBadEventMask, (pointer) stuff->event_mask);
+       SendErrToClient(client, FSBadEventMask, (pointer) &stuff->event_mask);
        return FSBadEventMask;
     }
     client->eventmask = stuff->event_mask;
     return client->noClientException;
 }

Credits
- -------

The X.Org Foundation thanks Rodrigo Rubira Branco (<http://twitter.com/bsdaemon>)
from the Qualys Vulnerability & Malware Research Labs (VMRL) for bringing
this issue to Oracle's attention, and Oracle for notifying X.Org once the
issue was found to be in the common (though older) code base.

The X.Org Foundation also thanks Thomas Dickey & the XFree86 Project for
providing a fix that has protected our users since the integration of the
XFree86 code base into X11R6.7.

## Background

I overlooked this on the Xorg mailing list, but noticed it in
a web search shortly after:

> [X.Org security advisory: DoS/info leak in xfs prior to
> X11R6.7/XFree86 3.3.3](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.xorg.announce/1770) — Alan Coopersmith (24 Jul
> 17:31 2012).

It quotes my changelog comment:

> Prototype/ansification cleanup for Xserver/XIE, xfs,
> fontlib, mkfontdir, and fix some bugs found along the way
> (#2103, Thomas Dickey).

but does not give a date. Some discussion is in order, to put
this in its proper context.

## XFree86 work

I started working with XFree86 in January 1996, on [xterm](/xterm/xterm.html). While my main interest was xterm,
I felt inclined to help on the larger project scope.

I started by getting a copy of the source, and learning how to
build it. That took about 6 hours on a 56Kb modem. This was a
given in the 1990s, for anyone who was not using resources owned
by a university or company.

I sent patch files to the mailing list. These were integrated
by the XFree86 core developers. This was the basis for the
versioning which I use for xterm, referring to
"patch #".

Periodically the XFree86 developers provided patches to the
next incremental version. I applied those, and thereby kept in
sync with their versions for a few years, until early 2001 when
high-speed Internet connections to the home became a reality.
Around that point, I (and several other proficient developers)
were given CVS commit privileges in XFree86.

The change cited for the CVE is noted in the XFree86 changelog
in this section:

> XFree86 3.9Nk (25 October 1998)

and my corresponding patch was dated 23 October 1998.

It is nice to get credit, but it is nicer to credit people
correctly.

### XFree86 versus Xorg (early)

Reviewing my patches (outside xterm), I see that I changed
about 15,000 lines of code between 1996-2000 (15491 inserts,
14417 deletes). My changes to xterm were more extensive over the
same period (66710 inserts, 29132 deletes).

My intent was to reduce compiler warnings, to make it possible
to see real problems. Initially I made a few fixes in Xlib.h, and
later in the Xserver tree. More than half the roughly 600 files
which I touched are under Xserver. However, I also modified
libraries (X11, Xau, Xaw, Xdmcp, Xi, Xmu, dps, dpstk, font,
xkbfile) and programs (mkfontdir, patch, pswrap, setxkbmap,
xclipboard, xconsole, xdm, xfs, xkbcomp, xmag, xman,
xvidtune).

The reduction was real. When I started, there were 60-70
thousand warning messages from my build logs (which were stricter
than the default). After the initial changes (chiefly the changes
to Xlib.h), I got it down to about half that amount. With more
work, it came down to a little over 20 thousand warning messages.
(There are 3.3 million lines of code in my last CVS pull from
XFree86 in 2006).

By "more work", I mean that I worked on all files in a library
or program, converting them to ANSI C and checking the compiler
warnings.

Referring to email for relevant dates:

* XFree86 CVS was made publicly viewable (readonly) June 23,
  2000. In his email to the "members" mailing list, David Dawes
  also remarked on the public mailing lists and their
  archives.
* From this point, mail archives exist, and there should be
  no serious dispute about who did or said what.
* Likewise, changes to/from XFree86 versus X.org were done on
  the basis of patches:
  + Kurt Lidl reported 24 August 2000 on "devel" that he
    had made a set of diff's for X11R6.4 versus X11R6.5.1, and
    that a large part of the diff was the change of $TOG to
    $Xorg for CVS id's.
  + There were several follow-on comments which (in my
    reply to mail from Juliusz Chroboczek) we agreed that there
    were no substantial changes which would affect XFree86
    development:
    > I read through the portions I'm familiar with;
    > they're a regurgitation of the X11R6.4 public patches
    > from last year (and most of the bulk of the patch seems
    > to be under the XFree86/XFree98 trees).
  + David Dawes would import the X11R6.5.1 changes as a
    branch, announced in mid-January 2001.
* mail to "patchers" on 27 November 2000 announced four new
  CVS committers:
  + Paulo Cesar Pereira de Andrade
  + David Bateman
  + Thomas Dickey
  + Matthieu Herrb
* My first CVS commit appears to be 6 December 2001, as part
  of [xterm patch
  #149](/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_149). Thereafter, while I have a detailed history of xterm,
  I have only changelog comments relating to other parts of
  XFree86, and would rely on their CVS for details.

### XFree86 versus Xorg (later)

With that background in mind, consider this posting in 2004 by
Daniel Barkalow (iabervon) on Linux Weekly News:

> [Posted Apr 8, 2004
> 0:42 UTC (Thu) by subscriber iabervon](http://lwn.net/Articles/79447/)
>
> X.org has been releasing X versions all along, which XFree86
> has been taking and incorporating into their distributions. If
> you look at an XFree86 distribution, it will have a set of
> release notes for the X.org portion as well as the main release
> notes. *It has been X.org's versions of things like xrdb,
> xterm, xfontsel, etc. which you get if you get XFree86.*
> With this release, X.org has started releasing complete
> distributions, including the stuff that XFree86 would formerly
> have added. The last like this was done, the organization doing
> it was still the X Consortium, so this is the first complete X
> distribution by X.org, despite the fact that they've made a
> number of previous incomplete distributions. The odd part is
> mainly that they've kept the same version numbering when going
> from the incomplete distribution intended for repackaging to
> the complete one intended for end users.

There are several parts to the posting. The principal one is
the assertion that "It has been X.org's versions of things",
etc., stating in so many words that XFree86's contribution to the
whole was a minor, subservient role. The remainder of the
paragraph builds up to that point, reiterates it and ends with a
quibble about version numbering.

At that point, I had been developing xterm for 8 years, and
knew well that it was not "X.org's versions of things like xrdb,
xterm, xfontsel, etc."

Besides xterm, my changes touched the other programs. The
resulting changes were used in released versions of XFree86.
Barkalow's posting misattributed the work done. In the case of
*my* work which he pointedly mentioned, this is more than
three-quarters of the work which I did.

The point of the CVE description is that X.org began at this
point to distribute the XFree86 code, which included my fixes. So
the problem "went away". Until that point, X.org had not
incorporated any of my work.

It was not "odd" that they kept the same version numbering,
because after all it *was* X.org plus a few new people
such as Daniel Stone (daniels) commenting in the LWN thread.

At this writing (late July 2012), X.org's webpage is available
via the [Internet archive](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110611072806%2A/http%3A//www.x.org/XOrg_background.html):

[April 2, 2003](http://web.archive.org/web/20030402160332/http%3A//www.x.org/XOrg_background.html)
describes "X.Org, a global consortium". The current members
page lists Hewlett Packard, Sun, IBM, Hummingbird, SGI, WRQ,
Shiman Associates, Metro Link. XFree86 is listed as an honorary
member.
[June 2, 2004](http://web.archive.org/web/20040602233431/http%3A//www.x.org/XOrg_background.html)
notes that it was reorganized on 22 January 2004; the
members page still listed XFree86. It was removed sometime
between October 9 and December 4.

At no point in X.Org's webpages is found a discontinuity: it
was the essentially same people throughout.

## Corrected attribution

Reviewing *my* patches, I do not see the cited
change.

There is another source of information. Looking at the XFree86
CVS for [events.c](http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/programs/xfs/difs/events.c),
My changes are revision 3.3. I see that the CVE fix was
introduced in the next revision (3.4). The changelog comment by
David Dawes says only

> initial 3.9Nr patches

The XFree86 changelog is not much help. However, the same
commit as above touches on compiler warning fixes. Looking at
[revision 3.653](http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/CHANGELOG?r1=3.652&r2=3.653) offers this possibility:

> 2086. LP64 compiler warning fixes from the NetBSD xsrc tree
> (#2019, Ross Harvey).

But that is only an educated guess (unless Ross Harvey happens
to have his original patches, etc).

On the other hand, my changes helped *find* the bug.
They added function prototypes for `SendErrToClient`
in client.h, and in a new header file dispatch.h. Compiling on my
32-bit machine did not yield a warning message, but it was not
unusual for someone to report warnings in "quiet" code when
building on a 64-bit machine.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=842841#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-07-24 17:32:54 UTC  ``` From the upstream announcement [1]:  A vulnerability has been found in the X11R6 font server code in the handling of the SetEventMask request in xfs - if an invalid mask is specified, it passes that bad mask to the SendErrToClient() function for returning to the client in the error message.  Unfortunately, SendErrToClient() expects a pointer, but was being passed the raw mask value, causing it to use the mask as a pointer, either segfaulting (if that happened to be an invalid pointer), or returning whatever data happened to be accessible in the 4 bytes at the address specified by the mask value.  X11R6 through X11R6.6 appear to be vulnerable.   The fix shown below was introduced by XFree86 in their 3.3.3 release as part of the commit for:    Prototype/ansification cleanup for Xserver/XIE, xfs, fontlib, mkfontdir,    and fix some bugs found along the way (#2103, Thomas Dickey).  X11R6.7 incorporated the XFree86 changes, and thus X11R6.7 and later releases from X.Org are not vulnerable.  [1] <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2012-July/002040.html>  Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of xorg-x11-xfs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it no longer uses or provides the XFS font server.   ``` |  |
