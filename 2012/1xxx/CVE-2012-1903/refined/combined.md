Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/webwidecrawl)

The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.
At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.
View the web archive through the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php).

Collection: [Wide Crawl Number 14 - Started Mar 4th, 2016 - Ended Sep 15th, 2016](https://archive.org/details/wide00014)

The seed for Wide00014 was:

- Slash pages from every domain on the web:

-- a list of domains using Survey crawl seeds
-- a list of domains using Wide00012 web graph
-- a list of domains using Wide00013 web graph

- Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph

-- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links)
-- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain
The seed list contains a total of 431,055,452 URLs
The seed list was further filtered to exclude known porn, and link farm, domains
The modified seed list contains a total of 428M URLs
