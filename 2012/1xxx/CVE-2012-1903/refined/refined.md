Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   The vulnerability exists in Telligent Community version 5.6.583.20496.
*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected content.
*   **Javascript Injection:** This indicates that the attacker is injecting javascript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Hijacking:** The attacker may potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker may be able to access data on the vulnerable website or redirect the user to malicious websites to steal data.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could use the injected script to redirect users to sites hosting malware.
*   **Website Defacement:** The injected script can potentially alter the appearance or behavior of the targeted website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable input field or parameter.
*   **Storage:** The injected script is stored in the Telligent Community database.
*  **Retrieval/Execution:** When other users access the page containing the malicious code the script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable application, likely via a web form or other user-facing interface.
*   The attacker does not require a privileged position on the system (i.e. they do not need to be an administrator or privileged user.)
*   The attacker needs to find a way to inject javascript code that will be stored on the server.
*   No specific information about required user interaction with the malicious payload is specified.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically identified in Telligent Community 5.6.583.20496.
*   The injected code can be stored, indicating that it will be executed later for other users.
