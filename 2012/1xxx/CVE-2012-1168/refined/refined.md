    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of user password updates.",
      "Password reset vulnerability via web service function"

      "By sending a crafted web service request to update user profiles without providing the user's current password."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to make web service calls to the target Moodle platform. This could be from an authenticated user with permission to call the vulnerable web service function or an unauthenticated attacker exploiting the API if authentication is not required.",
