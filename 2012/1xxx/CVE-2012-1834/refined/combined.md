## Description

Adds a CMS-like tree overview of all your pages and custom posts to WordPress ‚Äì much like the view often found in a page-focused CMS.

Also check out [OrganizeWP](https://organizewp.com/?utm_campaign=migrate&utm_source=cmstpv&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=desclink) if your goal is to incorporate multiple content types into a single view!

Within this tree you can edit pages, view pages, add pages, search pages, and drag and drop pages to rearrange the order.

CMS Tree Page View is a good alternative to plugins such as pageMash, WordPress Page Tree and My Page Order. For **multiple content types** and other new features check out [OrganizeWP](https://organizewp.com/?utm_campaign=migrate&utm_source=cmstpv&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=desclink) as well.

Page management in WordPress won‚Äôt get any easier than this!

#### Features and highlights:

* View your pages & posts in a tree-view, like you view files in Windows Explorer or the Finder in OS X
* Drag and drop to rearrange/order your pages
* Add pages after or inside a page
* Add multiple pages at once ‚Äì perfect for setting up a new site structure
* Edit pages
* View pages
* Search pages
* Available for both regular pages and custom posts
* Works with both hierarchical and non-hierarchical post types
* View your site hierarchy directly from the WordPress dashboard
* Drag and drop between trees with different post types to change to post type of the draged item, i.e. change a regular page to became any custom post type
* Support for translation plugin [WPML](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sitepress-multilingual-cms/), so you can manage all the languages of your site

#### Show your pages on your site in the same order as they are in CMS Tree Page View

To show your pages on your website in the same order as they appear in this plugin, you must

sort them by ‚Äúmenu order‚Äù.

```
// Example using query_posts
$args = array(
  'post_type' => 'page',
  'orderby'=> 'menu_order',
  'order'=>'ASC',
);
$posts = query_posts($args);

// Example using wp_query
$args = array(
    'post_type' => 'page',
    'orderby' => 'menu_order',
    'order' => 'ASC',
);
$query = new WP_Query( $args );

```

### [Well-maintained, extremely useful open source tool](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/well-maintained-extremely-useful-open-source-tool/)

CMS Tree Page View is straightforward, very useful and well-maintained. Everything that open source should be. WordPress owes its success to developers like Jon Christopher and P√§r Thernstr√∂m who create powerful, truly open source solutions like CMS Tree Page View and Simple History and share them for free, without huge advertising banners or interruption marketing with unnecessary admin notifications.
We are proud to modestly sponsor Simple History and P√§r. We sponsored Jon Christopher enough with his SearchWP plugin which practices discriminatory pricing against existing users (much higher renewal prices than purchase prices) which is the antithesis of the open source spirit.

* Added option to show the tree in the regular post overview screen. Makes the tree view fit into the regular workflow and GUI much better.

Then go to for example the pages overview screen and in the upper right corner there will be an icon to switch between the regular list view and the tree view of this plugin.
* Fixed so search button now looks more like the rest of the WordPress GUI
* Fixed a undefined index warning
* Fixed wrong language count for WPML-enabled post types
* Perhaps fixed a problem with some other plugins, for example Formidable Pro
* Added icon to settings page
* Added updated Russian translation
* Updated POT-file for translators

#### 1.1

* Added ‚ÄúAdd new‚Äù-link next to headline, to better match the regular post overview page + it makes it possible to add new pages/posts when there are no pages/posts added (previously there needed to be at least one post added to be able to add new posts)
* Added post count in parenthesis after each post status. Also makes the page match the regular post overview page a it more. Works for both built in post types and custom post types + if WPML is installed it will show post count for each language too.
* Fixed a bug with sortables (well, I kinda forgot to load that script at all!) that made the plugin only work on the dashboard.
* Fixed some IE-bugs

#### 1.0

* New: create multiple pages at once! Add multiple pages faster than ever before! You can even select if the new pages should be drafts or published. And ever drag and drop the pages to get the correct order even before adding them. I know ‚Äì it‚Äôs awesome!
* Fixed: adds new pages with the correct and selected WPML-language
* Added: you can now change the type of a post by draging the post between different trees on the dashboard. So if you have one custom post type called ‚ÄúCars‚Äù and another called ‚ÄúBicycles‚Äù you can now drag a page from the cars tree to the bicicyles tree and the post will converted to that post type. Pretty powerful feature that you used to need a separately plugin to be able to do.
* Misc fixes
* Added new POT-file for translators
* I decided to call this version 1. I‚Äôve been using this plugin for so long time now and I use it in almost every WordPress project I participate in (all projects with lots of pages), so with this new add-mulitple-page-feature it feels like it‚Äôs time to go to version 1. Hope you‚Äôll agree! üôÇ

#### 0.10.1

* Fixed popup closing to fast on Firefox.
* Enable menu item setting by default for hierarchical post types during first install. It was confusing when it was enabled for pages but not for other post types. Consistency!
* Added link to settings page to plugin listing.
* Fixed: WPML-stuff now also works on custom post types

#### 0.10

* Fixed position of action div. Now it‚Äôs always to the right of the page name.
* Fixed so action div never is below the fold of the browser. Instead it‚Äôs moved up until it‚Äôs visible.
* Fixed problem related to hoverIntent and mouseover and drag and drop. There was just to many wierd things going on so I switched to my own solution instead. Let me know if it works ok for you too now again!

#### 0.9

* Only output scripts and styles on pages that the plugin uses. This should speed up other parts of the WordPress admin a little tiny itsy bitsy bit.
* Added a hopefully not to spammy box about donation and stuff. Hopefully it it encourages some of you to give it a good review or maybe even donate some money. I‚Äôve spent a lot, lot, LOT of time developing this plugin you know üòâ
* Changed title on dashboard widgets and changed name of the menu item under each supported post type. Makes the titles/names look/feel a bit less dorky.
* Show icons next to the headline of top of pages with the tree
* Minor CSS changes like a little bit bigger text on the pages and a bit more spacing between each page. Makes a bit easier to drag and drop/move them around.
* Changed javascript to to use on() istead on live()
* Removed hoverIntent since that is included in WordPress by default
* Started using hoverIndent to make the popup with page actions show after a short while for each page. This also means that you can move outside the actions-pop-up for a short while without the pop up being closed ‚Äì a thing that annoyed me very much. This makes the whole popup actions div thingie feels less in-your-face all the time. Hope you like it as much as I do!

* Fixed: The capability required to show the tree for a post type should now be correct. Previously it was hard-coded to ‚Äúedit\_pages‚Äù. Thanks to Kevin Behrens, author of plugin Role Scoper, for solving this.

#### 0.7.20

* Changed caller\_get\_posts (deprecated since 3.1) to ignore\_sticky\_posts
* Norwegian translation added by Eigil Moe (http://www.eimoe.com)

#### 0.7.19

* Greek translation added by Mihalis Papanousis (http://aenaon.biz)
* Hopefully fixed some more problems with columns

#### 0.7.18

* Second try: Hopefully fixed the problem that moving a page resulted in WPML losing the connection between the languages
* Hungarian translation added
* Small CSS fixes
* Fixed compatiblity issue with ALO EasyMail Newsletter

#### 0.7.17

* Removed cookie.js
* Updated jstree
* If Keyboard Shortcuts was enabled for a user, title and content of a post could not be edited.
* Drag and drop is now a bit more accurate and less ‚Äújerky‚Äù
* Hopefully fixed the problem that moving a page resulted in WPML losing the connection between the languages
* Dutch translation added
* Hebrew translation added
* Updated POT-file. Translators may want to check for added or updated words and sentences.
* Fixed a notice-message

#### 0.7.16

* Fix for wpml-languages with ‚Äú-‚Äù in them, like chinese simplified or chinese traditional.

  https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-cms-tree-page-view-broken-for-languages-with-a-in
* Fixed some problems with columns and utf-encoding
* Moved adding page to a box above the tree, so you won‚Äôt get the feeling that the tree has been deleted when you add a page.

#### 0.7.15

* Czech translation added
* Italian translation added, by Andrea Bersi (http://www.andreabersi.com)
* require(dirname(**FILE**).‚Äù/functions.php‚Äù); instead of just require(‚Äúfunctions.php‚Äù);. Should fix problems with for example BackWPup.

#### 0.7.14

* Added links to PayPal and Flattr, so users who like the plugin can donate.

#### 0.7.13

* Upgraded jstree to rc2. This fixes the problems with drag & drop and mouse over that occured in WordPress 3.1 beta.

#### 0.7.12

* Readme-fix‚Ä¶

#### 0.7.11

* If a post has a custom post status, that status will be shown instead of ‚Äúundefined‚Äù. So now CMS Tree Page View works better together with plugins like ‚ÄúEdit flow‚Äù.

#### 0.7.10

* CSS images loaded from google via https instead of http. Does this solve the problems you guys with https-sites had?
* Users of IE could not add pages at the right place. All pages where added at the top instead of after or inside another page. Only tested in IE 8, please let me know of the other version..

#### 0.7.9

* changed so some icons are loaded from ajax.googleapis.com instead of Google Code. Google Code was a bit slow.

#### 0.7.8

* Something went wrong with last update at wordpress.org, people got 404-error when trying to download plugin. Let‚Äôs see if this update helps..

#### 0.7.7

* Added Portuguese translation by Ricardo Tomasi. Thank you!
* Celebration Edition: over 25.000 downloads of this plugin at WordPress.org!

#### 0.7.6

* You can now view items in the trash. A bit closer to a complete take over of the pages-page üôÇ

#### 0.7.5

* fixed some notice-errors and switched some deprecated functions
* updated swedish translation
* fixed some strings that where untranslatable and updated POT-file (if I missed any, please let me know)
* no longer allowed to add sub pages to a page with status draft, because if you edit the page and save it, wordpress will forget about the parent (and you will get confused)
* started using hoverIntent for popup instead of regular mouseover, so the popups won‚Äôt feel so aggressive ‚Äì or no.. reverted this üôÅ
* when adding a page a text comes up so you know that something is going on
* possible fix for magic fields and other plugins that deal with post columns

#### 0.7.4

* Updated POT-file, so translators may wan‚Äôt to check their translations.
* Added Spanish translation by Carlos Janini. Thank you!

#### 0.7.3

* a page can now be moved above a page with the same menu order. moved page will get the menu order of the page that it‚Äôs moved aboved, and the other page will get a menu order of previous menu order + 1. i think/hope this is finally solved now!
* using wp\_update\_post when moving pages (instead of sql directly). this should make this plugin work better with some cache plugins, for example DB Cache Reloaded
* root of tree is added initially, without the need to run an ajax query. loading the root of the tree = super fast! child nodes that are not previosly open are still loaded with ajax, because I want to be sure that the plugin does not hang if there is a page with super-mega-lots of children.

#### 0.7.2

* pages that the user is not allowed to edit now get ‚Äúdimmed‚Äù. they will still be visible becuase a page a user is not allowed to edit, may have a child-page that they are allowed to edit, so the sub-pages must still be accessible
* some problems with Ozh‚Äô Admin Drop Down Menu fixed (tree showed posts instead of pages)

#### 0.7.1

* quick fix: capability edit\_pages required to view the tree menu, instead of editor (which led to administrators not being able to view the tree‚Ä¶)

#### 0.7

* added comment count to pop up
* added support for custom columns in pop up = now you have the same information available in CMS Tree Vage View as in the normal page/post edit screen
* fixed some colors to better match wordpress own style
* editor capability required to view tree. previosly only administators chould see the tree in the menu, while everyone could view the tree on the dashboard.
* no more infinite loops with role scoper installed
* tested on WordPress Multisite

#### 0.6.3

* tree is activated for pages during install, so the user does not need to set up anything during first run

#### 0.6.2

* Was released only as a public beta together with wpml.org, to test the wpml-integration
* Now supports custom post types.
* Now compatible with WPML Multilangual CMS (wpml.org).
* Uses WordPress own functions at some more places.
* When searching and no posts found you now get a message so you know that there were no matches.
* German translation added, by Thomas Dullnig (www.sevenspire.com). Thank you!
* Lots of code rewritten for this update of CMS Tree Page View, so please let me know if it works or if I broke something!

#### 0.6.1

* Forgot to close a p-tag correctly. Now it should validate again!
* Fixed a problem where move could seem to not work when trying to move pages when several pages had the same menu\_order, so they where sorted by alpha instead.
* fixed a problem with qtranslate that resulted in endless ‚Äúloading tree‚Ä¶‚Äù
* the thank you/need help/please donate-box is re-enabled upon upgrade/re-activation of the plugin. Just so you won‚Äôt forget that you can donate! üôÇ

#### 0.6

* updated french translation
* new box for mouse-over/pop-up ‚Äì please let me know what you think about it
* new box: it‚Äôs bigger so it‚Äôs less likely that you slide out of it with your mouse (happend to me all the time! very annoying‚Ä¶) .
* new box: more information can be fitted there. let me know if there is any information you would like to see in the popup (right now it will show you the last modified date + the id of the page)
* new box: edit and view links are real links now, so you can edit or view pages in for example a new tab
* new box: oh.. and it‚Äôs much better looking! üôÇ

#### 0.5.7

* jquery.cookie.js renamed to jquery.biscuit.js to fix problems with apache module mod\_security. let me know if it actually works! üôÇ
* updated .pot-file, so translators out there may want to check if everything is up to date

#### 0.5.6

* password protected posts now show a lock icon (thanks to [Seebz](http://seebz.net) for contributing)

#### 0.5.5

* ok, now the texts should be translated. for real! thanks for the bug report!

#### 0.5.4

* when mouse over the litte arrow the cursor is now a hand again. it just feels a little bit better that way.
* some texts where not translated due to wp\_localize\_script being called before load\_plugin\_textdomain. thanks for reporting this.

#### 0.5.3

* link to ‚Äúadd new page‚Äù when there were no pages now work
* changed native js prompt to http://abeautifulsite.net/2008/12/jquery-alert-dialogs/ (mostly because you can use your other browser tabs while the dialog/prompt is open)
* added a thank-you-please-donate-box. please do what it says! üôÇ
* started using menu\_page\_url instead of hard-coding path to plugin
* now requires WordPress 3

#### 0.5.2

* you could get an error if used together with the ‚ÄúSimple Fields‚Äù WordPress plugin (yes, I used the same function name in both plugin! Fool me twice, shame on me.)

#### 0.5.1

* forgot to add styles to svn

#### 0.5

* Uses wp\_localize\_script to translate script. Previous method could lead to 404-error, although the file did exist.
* More valid output
* jsTree upgraded to 1.0rc
* Code rewritten for upgraded jsTree
* Added a ‚Äúclear search‚Äù-button to the search box
* Dashboard widget added again! Hooray!
* Requires WordPress 3 because of jquery 1.4.2. If you are using WP 2.x you can try version 0.4.9 instead: https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/cms-tree-page-view.0.4.9.zip

#### 0.4.9

* added French translation by Bertrand Andres

#### 0.4.8

* added russian translation by Alexufo (www.serebniti.ru)
* fixed a link that didn‚Äôt change color on mouse over

#### 0.4.7

* remove some code that did not belong‚Ä¶
* does not show auto-draft-posts in wp3

#### 0.4.6

* could get database error because post\_content had no default value
* removed usage of console.log and one alert. ouch!

#### 0.4.5

* added Belorussian translation by [Marcis G.](http://pc.de/)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
