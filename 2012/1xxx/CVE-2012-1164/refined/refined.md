  "CVE-2012-1164": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A denial of service flaw in the way the slapd server of OpenLDAP processed certain search queries requesting only attributes (no values) for a particular entry.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Assertion failure, leading to slapd process abort.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (slapd server crash/abort).",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a specially-crafted LDAP search query.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable LDAP server."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs when the server processes search queries that request only attributes, but not their values for a specific entry, resulting in an assertion failure within the attribute handling code (attr_dup2) due to an incorrect comparison where the index 'j' is not less than index 'i' as expected.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is located in the `attr.c` file at line 236 (in OpenLDAP 2.4.25) inside the function `attr_dup2`, where an assertion `j < i` fails.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability causes an assertion failure leading to a denial of service where the slapd process aborts.",
        "Attack vectors":"The attacker must send an LDAP query with specific options/attributes to trigger the bug, specifically when attrsOnly is set to True, causing attributes to be returned without any values."
        ,
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated."
