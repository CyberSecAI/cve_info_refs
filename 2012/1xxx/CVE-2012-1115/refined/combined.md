Hi,

the first problem in user listing cannot be reproduced:

* The filter value which should contain malicious code is correctly
sanitized with htmlspecialchars() in LAM 3.6 and 3.1.0-2 (stable).
* list.php-filter-Dateien/error.png is not a script that is included in LAM

The other points are under investigation. I will work on a patch.

Best regards

Roland

This problem is located in the phpLDAPadmin part of LAM's code.
Therefore, the phpldapadmin package is also affected.

Patches for LAM upstream that may be ported to PLA:

Hi,

I sent a patch for Unstable to my sponsor. This should be uploaded soon.

For Stable the patch is attached. The Stable version is not affected by
the bug in add_value_form.php.

As written before, the report about the problem in list view is invalid
for Stable and Unstable.

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- LDAP Account Manager Pro / PhpLDAPadmin -- Multiple XSS flaws

Thank you for your reply and the ids, Kurt.

Since you didn't explicitly mention CVE identifiers
for phpLDAPAdmin, checking with you yet.

Can we consider the CVE-2012-1114, CVE-2012-1115
identifiers below to be valid also for phpLDAPAdmin code?

According to Roland's reply:
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/06/1>

contains a reduced copy of phpLDAPAdmin's code.

Though we issue only one CVE identifier for the original
source code and can use that one also for projects, embedding
that source, not sure the current situation wrt to these
two is the correct one.

Roland, could you clarify, if phpLDAPAdmin code would be vulnerable
to all issues listed for LDAP Account Manager too or if phpLDAPAdmin
would be vulnerable only for XSS issues when processing:
i)   'export',
ii)  'add_value_form'
iii)  and 'dn' variables?

And LDAP Account Manager would be vulnerable yet to additional
XSS flaws, due improper sanitization of 'filteruid', 'type',
and 'cmd' variables? (and these would be LDAP Account Manager
specific)

Because, if the latter is the case, I would propose the
CVE-2012-1114, CVE-2012-1115 identifiers to be used for phpLDAPAdmin
issues, and that we would assign new one for LDAP Account Manager
ones.

Any clarification here, which source code base is affected by
which issue exactly is appreciated.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Please use CVE-2012-1114 for these two issues (XSS, same reporter)

Please use CVE-2012-1115 for this vu;n (XSS, but different reporter)

... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

yes.

phpLDAPadmin is vulnerable to i, ii and iii.

Regarding the filteruid problem I cannot reproduce this. The variable is properly sanitized.
This is a LAM only thing.

Please use CVE-2012-1115 for this vu;n (XSS, but different reporter)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-05 10:26:21 UTC  ``` Originally (2012-03-01), the following cross-site (XSS) flaws were reported against LDAP Account Manager Pro (from Secunia advisory [1]): * 1) Input passed to e.g. the "filteruid" POST parameter when filtering result sets in lam/templates/lists/list.php (when "type" is set to a valid value) is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  * 2) Input passed to the "filter" POST parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "export" and "exporter_id" is set to "LDIF") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  * 3) Input passed to the "attr" parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "add_value_form" and "dn" is set to a valid value) is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  References: [1] <http://secunia.com/advisories/48221/> [2] <http://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=458>  Later (2012-03-03), it was reported: [3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=662050#15>  that subset (for 'export', 'add_value_form', and 'dn' variables) of these security flaws is applicable also against the code of PhpLDAPadmin, a web-based LDAP client.  Patches from LDAP Account Manager, which are applicable to PphLDAPAdmin: [4] <http://lam.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lam/lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/lib/export_functions.php?r1=1.4&r2=1.5> [5] <http://lam.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lam/lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/export.php?r1=1.1&r2=1.2> [6] <http://lam.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lam/lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/add_value_form.php?r1=1.6&r2=1.7>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-05 10:38:58 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the phpldapadmin package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16. Please schedule an update.  --  These issues affect the versions of the phpldapadmin package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 6 and Fedora EPEL 5 (though the latter one might require the proposed patches above to be backported to older PhpLDAPAdmin version being present). Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-05 10:39:41 UTC  ``` CVE request: [7] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/05/12>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-05 10:42:33 UTC  ``` Created phpldapadmin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 799878](show_bug.cgi?id=799878 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1114 CVE-2012-1115 phpldapadmin: XSS flaws via 'export', 'add_value_form' and 'dn' variables [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-05 11:04:40 UTC  ``` Created phpldapadmin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 799891](show_bug.cgi?id=799891 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1114 CVE-2012-1115 phpldapadmin: XSS flaws via 'export', 'add_value_form' and 'dn' variables [epel-6]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 799892](show_bug.cgi?id=799892 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1114 CVE-2012-1115 phpldapadmin: XSS flaws via 'export', 'add_value_form' and 'dn' variables [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c5)  Dmitry Butskoy    2012-03-06 14:55:03 UTC  ``` It seems that the patches present perform fix for the bundled, reduced version in LDAP Account manager only. Better to ask upstream anyway.  Reported upstream, <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3497660&group_id=61828&atid=498546>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=799873#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:09:00 UTC  ``` ARRAY(0x558ebe07a840)   ``` |  |
