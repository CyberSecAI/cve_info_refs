{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The MIT krb5 KDC (Key Distribution Center) daemon can free an uninitialized pointer while processing an unusual AS-REQ, leading to heap corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized pointer usage",
      "Heap corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "The KDC daemon can crash, leading to denial of service. It is also theoretically possible, but difficult, to achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the heap corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) messages over the network to the KDC."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the KDC. No authentication is required, however, a misconfigured legitimate client could trigger this vulnerability."
  },
    "affected_software": [
        "krb5 versions 1.8 and later"
    ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered in the kdc_handle_protected_negotiation() function during the processing of a FAST Kerberos protocol extension, where a checksum is created using an invalid key type. The vulnerability can also be triggered by a legitimate client if misconfigured in an unusual way. Current glibc protections may reduce the impact to a crash only."
