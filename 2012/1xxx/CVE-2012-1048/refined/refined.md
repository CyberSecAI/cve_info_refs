- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `filter` parameter within the `administrator.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to hijacking of customer/admin sessions and client-side context manipulation, potentially leading to account theft or further malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload within the `filter` parameter. The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting this crafted URL (high user interaction is required).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user (administrator or customer) into clicking on the link to trigger the exploit.
