The provided content is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions. This is relevant to CVE-2012-1075 as it describes vulnerabilities in multiple TYPO3 extensions, even though the CVE description is a placeholder.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause varies depending on the extension, but the vulnerabilities generally stem from:
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user inputs in SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inadequate handling of user-provided data when rendering web pages, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Improper handling of data, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploitation of flaws that allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Open Redirection:** Vulnerabilities that redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Flaws that allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   SQL Injection
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Information Disclosure
*   Arbitrary Code Execution
*   Open Redirection
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploitation varies depending on the specific vulnerability and extension:
*   **SQL Injection:** Could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Could allow attackers to inject malicious code into web pages viewed by other users, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*  **Information Disclosure:** May expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Could lead to a complete compromise of the server.
*   **Open Redirection:** Could be used to redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious locations.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** Attacks are primarily over the network through web requests.
*   **User Input:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities by injecting malicious input through web forms, URLs or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerabilities:** Attackers need knowledge of the vulnerable extensions and how to exploit the specific vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities may require the attacker to be logged in to the backend interface.
*   **Specific Privileges:** Arbitrary code execution may require a user to have admin privileges.

**Affected Extensions:**
The following third-party TYPO3 extensions are affected:
*   css\_filelinks
*   terminal
*   beuserswitch
*   rtg\_files
*   irfaq
*   skt\_eurocalc
*   jftcaforms
*   bc\_post2facebook
*   aeurltool
*   mv\_cooking
*   toi\_category
*   mm\_whtppr
*   sysutils
*   typo3\_webservice
*   ya\_googlesearch

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory categorizes extensions into those with 'Critical', 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' severity vulnerabilities.
*   It provides suggested CVSS v2.0 scores for each vulnerability.
*   Some extensions had updates available, while others were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the lack of security fixes from the maintainers.
*   The `mv_cooking` SQL injection vulnerability is noted to be actively exploited in the wild.

This detailed breakdown is more comprehensive than a typical CVE description and gives a clearer understanding of the vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
