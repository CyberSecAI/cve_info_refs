Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1669

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of phpMoneyBooks. Specifically, it is related to how the application handles the `module` GET parameter, which is used for module handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to LFI due to insufficient sanitization or validation of the `module` parameter.
- **Null-byte injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a null byte (`%00`) into the `module` parameter, which bypasses the application's intended file inclusion mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files on the server.
- This can lead to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file, by manipulating the `module` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMoneyBooks application.
- No authentication or prior access to the system is required.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `index.php` script and understand the use of the `module` GET parameter.
- `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be disabled on the server, and PHP version needs to be less than `5.3.4`

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit demonstrating the vulnerability using the `/etc/passwd` file as a target.
- The vendor released a patch (version 1.0.3) to fix this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability requires specific PHP configurations (`magic_quotes_gpc` off and PHP < 5.3.4) to be exploited using the null byte injection technique.
- The Exploit-DB entry associates this CVE with 2012-6665, which is likely an error, as the primary CVE associated is 2012-1669.
