Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-1826

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of authenticated users with template authoring permissions in dotCMS to create and upload malicious templates (XSLT or Velocity) that can execute arbitrary Java code. This is due to insufficient restrictions on the capabilities available within the template processing engine, specifically related to the use of XSLT and Velocity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The core issue is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary Java code via malicious templates.
*   **Insecure Template Processing:** The XSLT and Velocity template engines were not configured with proper security measures. Specifically, the default Uberspector in Velocity allowed access to methods that could lead to code execution.
*  **Insufficient Access Control:**  The system did not properly restrict template creation and uploading, allowing users with authoring permissions to upload malicious templates.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The system did not properly sanitize or validate the uploaded templates, allowing them to contain malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary Java code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The arbitrary code execution runs with the privileges of the web service account, which can lead to further privilege escalation.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **System Takeover:** In some cases, attackers can use the vulnerability to gain a shell on the web server, leading to full control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Template Upload:** The primary attack vector involves an authenticated user creating a malicious XSLT or Velocity template and uploading it to the dotCMS system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an authenticated account with the necessary permissions to create and upload templates in dotCMS.
*   **Template Authoring Permissions:** The attacker needs to have the role/permissions within dotCMS that allows template creation/upload.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided `gist.github.com` link contains a patch for the `XsltTool` which limits the ability to perform XSLT transforms to users who have the "Scripting Developer" role. It also contains a check to ensure that the `ENABLE_SCRIPTING` is set to true.
*   The vulnerability affects dotCMS version 1.9 and potentially earlier versions.
*   The fix involves upgrading to dotCMS version 1.9.5.1 or 2.0.1 and later.
*   Workarounds include unmapping the XSLT Tool in the `toolbox.xml` file or applying the provided `XSLT Tool` patch, and setting the `runtime.introspector.uberspect` property to `org.apache.velocity.util.introspection.SecureUberspector`.
*   The issue was reported by Ben Murphy.
