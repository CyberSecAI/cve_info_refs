Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2012-1522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory after they have been deleted. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access a cached object that has already been deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. The browser tries to access memory that has already been freed, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the current user. If the user is an administrator, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- This could allow the attacker to install malicious software, steal sensitive data, modify or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** Attackers can host a malicious website containing specially crafted content designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject the exploit code into legitimate websites, including those that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Email/Instant Messaging:** Attackers could trick users into clicking malicious links via email or IM, directing them to the exploit website.
- **Embedded ActiveX controls:** An attacker can embed a malicious ActiveX control (marked safe for initialization) within an application or a Microsoft Office document that uses the Internet Explorer rendering engine to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to host or inject a malicious webpage or file containing the exploit code.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious site (e.g., by clicking a link in a message) or open a malicious document/application.
- No authentication is required; the attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via the userâ€™s web browser.
- The attacker would gain the same user rights as the user running the vulnerable instance of IE.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-044, which provides a patch.
- The vulnerability was privately reported through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, meaning there was no public knowledge of the flaw before Microsoft released the patch.
- At the time of the bulletin's release, Microsoft had not received any reports of the vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild.
- Microsoft assigned a 'Critical' severity rating to the vulnerability on Windows client systems and a 'Moderate' rating on Windows servers.
- The fix involves modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory to prevent access after they have been freed.
- Workarounds include disabling ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in Internet Explorer, as well as using Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers, however these workarounds may cause reduced functionality.
