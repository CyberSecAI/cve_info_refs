### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

## Description

[![@jfritschi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1036402?u=43e1ae76998e53c5eed8c9efa80c158c25314716&v=4&size=48)](/jfritschi)[jfritschi](https://github.com/jfritschi)opened [on Jan 31, 2012](https://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/issues/22#issue-3040715)

The default path for the storage of these files is currently /tmp. Since both the PGT and debug log contain security relevant info they should be moved to 'session\_save\_path'. This should normally be a secure directory.

If anyone still wants to move it somewhere else, they are free to do so.

[@adamfranco](https://github.com/adamfranco) Any objections?

Hi,

Two security issues have been reported in phpCAS, which is embedded in
glpi:

<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q1/551>

I'm following this information so you can check if the embedded copy
needs an update, since you are also distributing it in the standard
tarball.

Note that in the Debian package I intend to remove it from the package,
since code copies are not something good, both for maintenance and
security. The best solution would be to create a separate package for
phpcas and maintain it, if someone volunteers that would be nice :)

Regards,
Pierre

Both of the files were archived in /tmp directory in files with unsafe permissions.
