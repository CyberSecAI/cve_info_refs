{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When a JBoss server is configured to use JaccAuthorizationRealm, the WebPermissionMapping class creates permissions that are not checked and can permit access to users without checking their roles. If the ignoreBaseDecision property is set to true on JBossWebRealm, the web authorization process is handled exclusively by JBossAuthorizationEngine, without any input from JBoss Web.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization checks",
       "Incorrect configuration of JBossWebRealm"
    ],
    "impact": "Any valid user can access an application without needing to be assigned the role specified in the application's web.xml security-constraint tag, leading to potential unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a JBoss server is configured to use JaccAuthorizationRealm and the `ignoreBaseDecision` property is set to `true` on `JBossWebRealm`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A valid user of the application is needed for exploitation, but no specific role or permission is required."
