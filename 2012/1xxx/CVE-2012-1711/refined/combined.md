# Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - June 2012

## Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - June 2012

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes across Java SE products.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below.  Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 7 Update 4 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JDK and JRE 6 Update 32 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 35 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_37 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JavaFX 2.1 and earlier | [JavaFX](/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html) |

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrix

Java SE fixes in this Update are cumulative; the latest Critical Patch Update includes all fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates.

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle Java SE | [Oracle JDK and JRE Risk Matrix](#AppendixJAVA) | * Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update June 2012 [My Oracle Support Note 1461813.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=299685389740769&id=1461813.1) * Developers can download the latest release from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.](/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) * Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com.](http://java.com) Users on the Windows platform can also use [automatic updates](//www.java.com/en/download/help/5000020700.xml) to get the latest release. * Developers and users can download the latest Java FX release from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html](/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html) |

#### Risk Matrix Content

The risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Document, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. Hence Oracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: Adam Gowdiak of Security Explorations; Andrei Costin via Secunia; Chris Ries via TippingPoint; and Clayton Smith of Entrust.

### Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Schedule

The next three dates for Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Updates are:

* 16 October 2012
* 19 February 2013
* 18 June 2013

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  12 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/javacpujun2012verbose.html).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

For issues in Deployment, fixes are only made available for JDK and JRE 7 and 6. Users should use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start in the latest JDK and JRE 7 or 6 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?_afrLoop=299737386154546&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=829358#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-06-06 14:37:07 UTC  ``` Various classes in the Java Runtime standard library created temporary files with insecure permissions.  Depending on the current umask setting, temporary files could have been created with permissions allowing access by other group members or all system users.  Local attackers could use this flaw to gain access to possibly sensitive content of the temporary files.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=829358#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-06-12 20:23:22 UTC  ``` Public now via: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2012-1515912.html>  Fixed in Oracle Java 7 Update 5 and 6 Update 33.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=829358#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-06-13 08:50:29 UTC  ``` The fix for this issue is or will be included in the following IcedTea versions:  * IcedTea6 1.10.8  * IcedTea6 1.11.3 * IcedTea7 2.1.1 * IcedTea7 2.2.1  IcedTea6 releases announcement:  <http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/distro-pkg-dev/2012-June/019076.html> <http://blog.fuseyism.com/index.php/2012/06/12/security-icedtea6-1-10-8-1-11-3-released/>  Patch: <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/release/icedtea6-1.11/file/6e6d7783aabb/patches/security/20120612/7143606.patch> <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/release/icedtea7-forest-2.1/jdk/rev/98a24555076b>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=829358#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-13 13:10:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0730 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0730.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=829358#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-13 13:10:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0729 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0729.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=829358#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-13 20:02:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0734 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0734.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=829358#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2012-06-14 08:02:07 UTC  ``` According to Secunia SA49472, this is the issue for which Andrei Costin is credited in Oracle CPU:    <http://secunia.com/advisories/49472>    14) An error in the printing functionality due to creating temporary spool   files with insecure permissions can be exploited to disclose the contents   of printed documents owned by other users.    ...
