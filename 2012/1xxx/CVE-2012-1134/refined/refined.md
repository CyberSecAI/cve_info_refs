  "CVE-2012-1134": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `T1_Get_Private_Dict` function of the Type1 font parser in FreeType. This occurs because the function does not validate if the size of `private_dict` buffer is at least 4 bytes before overwriting the first 4 bytes with space (' ') characters.",
    "affected_versions": "freetype2 versions before 2.4.9",
    "root_cause": "The `T1_Get_Private_Dict()` function in FreeType's Type1 font parser does not properly validate the size of the buffer before writing to it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted Type1 font file that, when opened by an application using FreeType, can lead to application crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted font files",
        "Remote attacker"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted Type1 font file to a user who opens it in an application linked against FreeType."
