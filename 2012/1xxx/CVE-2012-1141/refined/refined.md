  "description": "The BDF parser in FreeType before 2.4.9 has a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability when splitting a list during the parsing of a specially crafted font file. This could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow execution of arbitrary code.",

    "< 2.4.9"
   ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly initialize a field array in the BDF parser's list splitting function.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Heap-based buffer over-read."

  "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted font file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service condition (application crash).",
  "attack_vectors": [
     "Specially crafted BDF font files"
  ],
