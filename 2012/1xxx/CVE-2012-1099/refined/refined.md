Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the 'select' helper method in Ruby on Rails handles HTML escaping when developers manually create HTML option tags. Specifically, when these tags are constructed manually and include user input, the values might not be properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. When the select tag options are generated manually, user-controlled input used within these options is not sanitized. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Escaping:** The core issue is the lack of proper HTML escaping of user-supplied data when constructing select tag options manually. The `select` helper method does not automatically escape these values when they are passed as a string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary HTML/Webscript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the web page by crafting a special input within the select tag options.
- **Compromised User Sessions:** This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers might be able to modify data presented on the page or trick users into performing actions they didn't intend.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The primary attack vector is through user-provided input that is included in the HTML options tags of the `select` helper method.
- **Manipulated Data:** An attacker can manipulate the user input that will be part of the select tag options which are then rendered to the web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require physical access to the server.
- **Ability to Influence User Input:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious data into the input fields that are used by the application to construct select options.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Rails versions 3.2.2, 3.1.4, and 3.0.12.
- Patches were released to address the issue for the 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 release series.
- A workaround is available, which involves using the `content_tag` method to create options, ensuring proper HTML escaping.
- The vulnerability is specific to cases where developers manually construct the HTML options tags for the `select` helper. If using the helper correctly with pre-built options it is not vulnerable.
