Package        : rails
Vulnerability  : cross site scripting
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1099
Debian Bug     : 668607

Sergey Nartimov discovered that in Rails, a Ruby based framework for
web development, when developers generate html options tags manually,
user input concatenated with manually built tags may not be escaped
and an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the document.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.14.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).

Subject: CVE Request -- Ruby on Rails (v3.0.12) / rubygem-actionpack: Two
 XSS flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   as noted in:
   [1] <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/3/1/ann-rails-3-0-12-has-been-released>

Issue #A:
----------
A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the String class, used
in Ruby on Rails, performed HTML escaping of SafeBuffer objects, when such
objects were manipulated directly via '[]' method or other methods, also
returning new instances of SafeBuffer object. By using these methods, such
newly returned SafeBuffer instances would be inadvertently marked as HTML safe.
If a Ruby on Rails application used SafeBuffer objects this way, a remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted input, which once processed by such
SafeBuffer instance would pass the HTML escaping test without further
filtering, possibly leading to arbitrary HTML or webscript execution.

<http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/attach/1c2e01a5e42722c9/3-0-safe-buffer-slice.patch?part=3>
     (against v3.0 branch)

     (against v3.1 branch)

[7A]
<http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/attach/1c2e01a5e42722c9/3-2-safe-buffer-slice.patch?part=5>

     (against v3.2 branch)

Issue #B:
----------
A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way 'select' helper method
of the Ruby on Rails performed HTML escaping of 'select' HTML tag options, when
the tags were created manually. In this case, the select tag values might end
up unescaped. A remote-attacker could provide a specially-crafted input to Ruby
on Rails application, using select tags this way, which potentially resulted
into arbitrary HTML or webscript execution.

     (against v3.0 branch)

     (against v3.2 branch)

Could you allocate CVE ids for these?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Versions Affected: All.
Fixed Versions: 3.2.2, 3.1.4, 3.0.12

Impact
------
When developers generate html options tags manually, user input concatenated with manually built tags may not be escaped and an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in to the document.

Only manually generated select tag options are impacted, but all users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The 3.2.2, 3.1.4, and 3.0.12 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
To work around this issue, escape manually built option tags passed to the select helper. For example:

BEFORE (vulnerable):

<%= select('post', 'author\_id', "<option value='#{[user.id](http://user.id)}'>#{[user.name](http://user.name)}</option>") %>

AFTER (values are escaped):

<%= select('post', 'author\_id', content\_tag(:option, [user.name](http://user.name), :value => [user.id](http://user.id)) %>

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 3-2-select\_options.patch - Patch for 3.2 series
\* 3-1-select\_options.patch - Patch for 3.1 series
\* 3-0-select\_options.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

Please note that only the 3.2.x, 3.1.x, and 3.0.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

Credits
-------

Credit for these patches goes to Sergey Nartimov! Thank you!
