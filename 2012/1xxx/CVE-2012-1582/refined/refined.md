Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-1582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A long-standing bug in the MediaWiki wikitext parser, specifically related to how it handles "strip markers," has security implications when combined with certain extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The vulnerability allows for XSS when the CharInsert extension is used.  The issue stems from the parser not properly handling strip markers, allowing malicious code to be injected. This XSS vulnerability can be triggered even without forged strip markers.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service attack through an infinite loop in the parser. This DoS is caused by forged strip markers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a MediaWiki page, which would then execute in the browsers of other users viewing the page. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, account compromise or phishing.
*   **DoS:** An attacker could cause the parser to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service condition that could disrupt the normal functioning of the MediaWiki installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Wiki Text:** The attack is carried out by crafting malicious wikitext, including crafted strip markers and special tags, which trigger the vulnerability when parsed.
*   **CharInsert Extension:**  The presence of the CharInsert extension is a significant factor in enabling the XSS exploit, though the issue is rooted in the core parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Edit Wiki Pages:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit wiki pages in order to insert the malicious wikitext. This usually means the attacker has some level of access to the wiki.
*   **Knowledge of MediaWiki Parser:** The attacker needs a detailed understanding of how the MediaWiki parser handles strip markers and how tags are processed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue was discovered by Bawolff who noticed that the parser didn't correctly handle forged strip markers.
*   A patch (killMarkers/markerStripCallback) was committed to fix the vulnerability by ensuring that strip markers are properly handled.
*   The CharInsert extension was patched by unstripping user-provided data in the extension.
*   The issue was present due to how the tag system was introduced, which allowed arguments to tag hook functions to include strip markers (which was not possible previously).
*   A fix for the infinite loop by limiting the number of iterations of the unstrip loop was proposed by Bawolff and later modified to improve performance.
