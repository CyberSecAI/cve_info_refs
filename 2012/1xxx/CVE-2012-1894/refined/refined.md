Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper folder permission settings within certain Microsoft Office for Mac installations. Specifically, the default permissions on the Microsoft Office 2011 folder and other related directories allowed write access to "others", which is not the expected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Default Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive default permissions on critical Office application directories, allowing non-privileged users or attackers to write files to them.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The ability to write to these directories enables an attacker to place a malicious executable in the affected folders.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a user subsequently executes the malicious file, attacker-provided code will be executed under the security context of the user running it.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user executing the malicious file is an administrator, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This could lead to the ability to:
   - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials to log on locally to the targeted system.
- **Social Engineering/Luring Attack:** The vulnerability is not a direct privilege escalation, it requires a user to be "lured" into executing the malicious file the attacker placed in the affected folders

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** Attacker needs to have local access to the targeted system with valid login credentials
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable into the affected directories before a user runs it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability primarily affects shared workstations like those found in libraries or internet cafes.
- This vulnerability does not affect Office for Mac 2011 installations in an upgrade scenario to Service Pack 2.
- Microsoft's security update corrects the permission settings on the affected folders.
- Workarounds include manually removing write permissions from "others" on the affected folders through terminal commands.
- Microsoft assigned this vulnerability an Important severity rating
- This vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin.
