Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0710)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2011-3101, CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939,
CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
Firefox no longer blocked Firefox inline event handlers. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to possibly bypass a web application's intended
restrictions, if that application relied on CSP to protect against flaws
such as cross-site scripting (XSS). (CVE-2012-1944)

If a web server hosted HTML files that are stored on a Microsoft Windows
share, or a Samba share, loading such files with Firefox could result in
Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
HTML files from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.5 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ken Russell of Google as the original reporter of
CVE-2011-3101; Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman
as the original reporters of CVE-2012-1937; Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov,
Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy as the
original reporters of CVE-2012-1938; Christian Holler as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-1939; security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google as
the original reporter of CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, and CVE-2012-1947;
security researcher Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1946; security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1944; and security researcher Paul Stone as the original reporter
of CVE-2012-1945.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-34

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:13.0/ rv:10.0.5)

Announced
June 5, 2012
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 13
* Firefox ESR 10.0.5
* SeaMonkey 2.10
* Thunderbird 13
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.5

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk
in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

### References

Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox 12.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

The following test asserts on mozilla-esr10 revision 65efc6ce102f (options -m -n -a):
try {
Object.prototype.nameSETS = 0;
function ownProperties() {
var props = {};
var r = function () {};
for (var a in r) {
let (a = function() { for (var r=0;r<6;++r) ++a; }) {
a();
}
props[a] = true;
}
}
ownProperties();
} catch(exc1) {}
According to bisection, the issue might have been fixed on mozilla-central by this revision:

summary: [Bug 692274](/show_bug.cgi?id=692274 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove the two blockChain hacks"), part 3 - Remove JSOP\_BLOCKCHAIN and JSOP\_NULLBLOCKCHAIN, which produces incorrect let scoping until the next patch (r=jorendorff)
Marking s-s because infer failures can be security related.

If this is [bug 703857](/show_bug.cgi?id=703857 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Assertion failure: [infer failure] Missing type pushed 0: float, at jsinfer.cpp:348"), then it is sg:critical and we must fix it somehow on ESR.

I don't know what the actual error is. [Bug 703857 comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=703857#c1 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Assertion failure: [infer failure] Missing type pushed 0: float, at jsinfer.cpp:348") seems to. Brian: is there some coarse-grained de-optimization we can apply here like "assume all let vars are closed" or something?

This is the same problem (and testcase) as [bug 703857](/show_bug.cgi?id=703857 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Assertion failure: [infer failure] Missing type pushed 0: float, at jsinfer.cpp:348"), the upvar analysis around let variables is broken pre-692274. The problem is with the 'var a' in the outer function being mislabelled by the frontend as not closed. TI already treats let variables as totally unknown, so there isn't an easy deoptimization I can see and an actual fix (or 692274 backport) is needed.

I agree w/Luke's [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=748613#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ESR] Assertion failure: [infer failure] Missing type pushed 0: float, at jsinfer.cpp:348"). -- any fixes short of backporting the whole 300K patch?
At first I was hopeful given the Oct date of the bisect in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=748613#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ESR] Assertion failure: [infer failure] Missing type pushed 0: float, at jsinfer.cpp:348") since that would be in Firefox 10/ESR. But that's the changeset date, the m-c push date was actually late December (Firefox 12).

Nice work. Want to add the test? Slightly more minimal:

Tracking for ESR shipping with Firefox 13, we won't chemspill the current ESR release already out there, which is affected, so this is the best we can do.

Since this is an ESR-only landing, should I be including a test-case that points directly to the bug (as suggested in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=748613#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ESR] Assertion failure: [infer failure] Missing type pushed 0: float, at jsinfer.cpp:348"))?

approved for landing to esr10, if it's not too much to also land the test case, I'm always a fan of tests :)

## Synopsis

Critical: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0715)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3101,
CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939, CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941,
CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
Thunderbird no longer blocked Thunderbird inline event handlers. Malicious
content could possibly bypass intended restrictions if that content relied
on CSP to protect against flaws such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
(CVE-2012-1944)

If a web server hosted content that is stored on a Microsoft Windows share,
or a Samba share, loading such content with Thunderbird could result in
Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
content from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ken Russell of Google as the original reporter of
CVE-2011-3101; Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman
as the original reporters of CVE-2012-1937; Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov,
Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy as the
original reporters of CVE-2012-1938; Christian Holler as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-1939; security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google as
the original reporter of CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, and CVE-2012-1947;
security researcher Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1946; security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-1944; and security researcher Paul Stone as the original reporter
of CVE-2012-1945.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to 10.0.5ESR fixing various
bugs and security issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-34 Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey,
Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox 12.(CVE-2012-1938)
Christian Holler reported a memory safety problem
that affects Firefox ESR. (CVE-2012-1939)
Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse
Ruderman reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR and Firefox 13. (CVE-2012-1937)
Ken Russell of Google reported a bug in NVIDIA
graphics drivers that they needed to work around in the
Chromium WebGL implementation. Mozilla has done the same in
Firefox 13 and ESR 10.0.5. (CVE-2011-3101)
\*
MFSA 2012-35 Security researcher James Forshaw of
Context Information Security found two issues with the
Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater service introduced
in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows Mozilla's
updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context.
The updater can be called by the Updater Service or
independently on systems that do not use the service. The
second of these issues allows for the updater service to
load an arbitrary local DLL file, which can then be run
with the same system privileges used by the service. Both
of these issues require local file system access to be
exploitable.
Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service
(CVE-2012-1942) Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from
application directory (CVE-2012-1943)
\*
MFSA 2012-36 Security researcher Adam Barth found
that inline event handlers, such as onclick, were no longer
blocked by Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script
blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature
of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were
not fully protected. (CVE-2012-1944)
\*
MFSA 2012-37 Security researcher Paul Stone reported
an attack where an HTML page hosted on a Windows share and
then loaded could then load Windows shortcut files (.lnk)
in the same share. These shortcut files could then link to
arbitrary locations on the local file system of the
individual loading the HTML page. That page could show the
contents of these linked files or directories from the
local file system in an iframe, causing information
disclosure.
This issue could potentially affect Linux machines
with samba shares enabled. (CVE-2012-1945)
\*
MFSA 2012-38 Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find a use-after-free while
replacing/inserting a node in a document. This
use-after-free could possibly allow for remote code
execution. (CVE-2012-1946)
\*
MFSA 2012-39 Security researcher Kaspar Brand found a
flaw in how the Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1
decoder handles zero length items. Effects of this issue
depend on the field. One known symptom is an unexploitable
crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles
zero-length basic constraints, assuming default values for
some types that should be rejected as malformed. These
issues have been addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now
being used by Mozilla. (CVE-2012-0441)
\*
MFSA 2012-40 Security researcher Abhishek Arya of
Google used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover several
issues: two heap buffer overflow bugs and a use-after-free
problem. The first heap buffer overflow was found in
conversion from unicode to native character sets when the
function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList
when working with column layout with absolute positioning
in a container that changes size. The second buffer
overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState when a window is
resized on a page with nested columns and a combination of
absolute and relative positioning. All three of these
issues are potentially exploitable.
Heap-buffer-overflow in utf16\_to\_isolatin1
(CVE-2012-1947) Heap-use-after-free in
nsFrameList::FirstChild (CVE-2012-1940)
Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLReflowState::CalculateHypotheticalBox, with nested
multi-column, relative position, and absolute position
(CVE-2012-1941)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-06-03 08:34:52 UTC  ``` Security researcher Adam Barth found that inline event handlers, such as onclick, were no longer blocked by Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected.   Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-36.html> <http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c1)  Murray McAllister    2012-06-05 03:26:47 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges security researcher Adam Barth as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-05 20:59:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0710 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0710.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=827830#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-06 23:51:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0715 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0715.html>   ``` |  |
