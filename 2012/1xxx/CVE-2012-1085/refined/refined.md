    *   `beuserswitch` (BE User Switch)
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *    `typo3_webservice` (Webservices for TYPO3)
*   **Open Redirection:**
     *    `irfaq` (Modern FAQ)
*   **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *  `terminal` (Terminal PHP Shell)

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization within the third-party extensions. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, scripts, or manipulate application behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper handling of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inadequate escaping of user-supplied data when displaying it in the browser.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposing sensitive information due to insufficient access control or improper data handling.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Unrestricted execution of attacker-controlled code.
*   **Open Redirection:**  Redirecting users to an attacker controlled site.
*   **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Unverified requests can be sent from an attacker to be executed on a user's behalf.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the website.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information about the system, users, or data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute malicious code on the server, leading to full compromise of the server.
*   **Open Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Attackers can force users to execute unwanted actions, such as changing passwords or performing financial transactions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL code is injected through input fields or URL parameters.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts are injected through input fields, URL parameters, or other data sources.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Vulnerable extensions expose sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting code vulnerabilities to execute malicious code on the server
*   **Open Redirection:** Manipulating the redirection destination using user controlled input.
*   **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Crafting malicious requests to be executed by a logged in user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker typically needs to be able to inject malicious input into the vulnerable extension, usually through web interfaces.
*   For arbitrary code execution, a user with backend access (authenticated) is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory highlights that the affected extensions are third-party and not part of the TYPO3 core.
*   Some of the extensions with vulnerabilities were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the authors failing to provide security fixes.
*   The advisory provides links to updated versions of the extensions where fixes are available.
*   The advisory also mentions that some vulnerabilities are known to be exploited in the wild.
*   The advisory provides CVSS v2.0 scores and vectors for each vulnerability, which show their severity and impact.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities addressed in this security advisory, and these vulnerabilities are related to CVE-2012-1085.
