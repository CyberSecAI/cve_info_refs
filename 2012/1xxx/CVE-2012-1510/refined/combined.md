##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware Tools Display Driver Privilege Escalation
The VMware XPDM and WDDM display drivers contain buffer overflow vulnerabilities and the XPDM display driver does not properly check for NULL pointers. Exploitation of these issues may lead to local privilege escalation on Windows-based Guest Operating Systems.
VMware would like to thank Tarjei Mandt for reporting theses issues to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ([cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org)) has assigned the names CVE-2012-1509 (XPDM buffer overrun), CVE-2012-1510 (WDDM buffer overrun) and CVE-2012-1508 (XPDM null pointer dereference) to these issues.
Note: CVE-2012-1509 doesn't affect ESXi and ESX.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

\* Remediation for VMware View is described in VMSA-2012-0004.

\*\* Notes on updating VMware Guest Tools:

After the update or patch is applied, VMware Guest Tools must be updated in any pre-existing Windows based Guest Operating System. The XPDM and WDDM drivers are part of Tools.

 Windows-Based Virtual Machines that have moved to Workstation 8 or Player 4 from a lower version of Workstation or Player are affected unless:

* They were moved from Workstation 7.1.5 or Player 3.1.5, and
* the Tools version was updated before the move.

 Windows-Based Virtual Machines that have moved to Fusion 4 from a lower version of Fusion are affected.

#####

b. vSphere Client internal browser input validation vulnerability
The vSphere Client has an internal browser that renders html pages from log file entries. This browser doesn’t properly sanitize input and may run script that is introduced into the log files. In order for the script to run, the user would need to open an individual, malicious log file entry. The script would run with the permissions of the user that runs the vSphere Client.

VMware would like to thank Edward Torkington for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ([cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org)) has assigned the name CVE-2012-1512 to this issue.

In order to remediate the issue, the vSphere Client of the vSphere 5.0 Update 1 release or the vSphere 4.1 Update 2 release needs to be installed. The vSphere Clients that come with vSphere 4.0 and vCenter Server 2.5 are not affected.

#####

c. vCenter Orchestrator Password Disclosure
The vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) Web Configuration tool reflects back the vCenter Server password as part of the webpage. This might allow the logged-in vCO administrator to retrieve the vCenter Server password.
VMware would like to thank Alexey Sintsov from Digital Security Research Group for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ([cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org)) has assigned the name CVE-2012-1513 to this issue.

#####

d. vShield Manager Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability
The vShield Manager (vSM) interface has a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability. If an attacker can convince an authenticated user to visit a malicious link, the attacker may force the victim to forward an authenticated request to the server.
VMware would like to thank Frans Pehrson of Xxor AB ([www.xxor.se](http://www.xxor.se)) and Claudio Criscione for independently reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ([cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org)) has assigned the name CVE-2012-1514 to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
