  "CVE-2012-1573": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS decrypted malformed TLS records. This could cause a TLS/SSL client or server to crash when processing a specially-crafted TLS record from a remote TLS/SSL connection peer.",
    "root_cause": "The GnuTLS library did not properly handle data encrypted with a block cipher when processing TLS records. Specifically, the block cipher decryption logic in GnuTLS assumed that a record containing any data which was a multiple of the block size was valid for further decryption processing. This led to a heap corruption vulnerability.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of GenericBlockCipher structures nested inside TLS records.",
        "Missing bounds check during TLS record processing.",
      "Incorrect assumption about data length when processing encrypted data."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by crashing a TLS/SSL client or server. Heap corruption can also occur.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted TLS record from a remote TLS/SSL connection peer.",
      "A malicious TLS/SSL server could send a crafted GenericBlockCipher structure with a valid IV but without the rest of the expected data."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS/SSL connection with the vulnerable client or server. The attacker requires knowledge of TLS record structure, cipher suites, and be able to construct valid records with malformed GenericBlockCipher structs.",
