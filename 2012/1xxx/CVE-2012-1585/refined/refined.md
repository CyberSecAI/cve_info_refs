Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation on server names within the OpenStack Nova API. Specifically, the API did not enforce a maximum length for server names before logging the name. This allowed for excessively long server names to be submitted, leading to the excessive growth of the `nova-api.log` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of input validation on the server name field. The system relied on the database column size to limit the name length, which only truncated the name upon insertion, rather than preventing the large name from being processed.
*   **Unbounded Logging:**  The vulnerability is also tied to the way the API logged the server name. The excessively large input caused large amounts of data to be written to the log file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:**  A malicious or compromised authenticated user can send requests with large server names leading to rapid consumption of disk space on the nova-api server. This can lead to a denial of service by filling up the partition where logs are stored.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Requests:** The attack vector involves making API requests to create or update servers with excessively long server names.
*   **PUT/POST Requests:** Both PUT requests (for updates) and POST requests (for creation) are vulnerable to this attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to make API calls to create or update servers within the OpenStack environment.

**Additional details from provided content:**

*   The issue was found in the OpenStack Compute (Nova) API.
*   The vulnerability exists because the API logs the full server name, and lacks validation of the name's length.
*   The database column for server names has a limit of 255 characters. However, the API didn't check the length before logging. Large names were truncated by the database, but not before being logged, thus the logs would still grow rapidly.
*   A proposed fix includes adding a check to the API to ensure server names are less than 256 characters.
*   A second mitigation, request size limiting middleware, was also considered to prevent large requests, although this was not immediately merged, due to potential risks close to the release.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of OpenStack Nova.
*   The fix was initially implemented in the Essex release and backported to the Diablo release.
