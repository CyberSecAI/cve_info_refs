# PUT/POST of large server name's can increase nova API log file size massively

Bug #962515 reported by
[Dan Prince](https://launchpad.net/~dan-prince)
on 2012-03-22

[264](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [OpenStack Compute (nova)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova) | Fix Released | High | [Dan Prince](https://launchpad.net/~dan-prince) | [OpenStack Compute (nova) 2012.1 "essex"](https://launchpad.net/nova/%2Bmilestone/2012.1) |
|  | [Diablo](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/diablo) | Fix Released | High | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

Using the following Ruby sample script I can increase the size of the Nova API log file 128M per POST:

require 'rubygems'

require 'openstack/compute'

USERNAME=ENV['NOVA\_USERNAME']

API\_KEY=ENV['NOVA\_API\_KEY']

API\_URL=ENV['NOVA\_URL']

bigboy = "0" \* 22222222

conn=OpenStack::Compute::Connection.new(:username => USERNAME, :api\_key => API\_KEY, :auth\_url => API\_URL, :service\_type => 'compute', :retry\_auth => false)

conn.create\_server(:name => bigboy, :imageRef => "8da06b6a-1ddd-4d4f-aa54-579e95b5e8b1", :flavorRef => 1)

------

Similarly I can do the same thing with a PUT (server name update):

conn=OpenStack::Compute::Connection.new(:username => USERNAME, :api\_key => API\_KEY, :auth\_url => API\_URL, :service\_type => 'compute', :retry\_auth => false)

server=conn.server("695e8b03-aed1-40ab-81bc-8e7456c36215")

server.update(:name => bigboy)

---

Each of these requests will increase the Nova API log file size by 128M per request:

[root@nova1 ~]# du -hs /var/log/nova/api.log

128M /var/log/nova/api.log

---

The root cause of the issue is that we rely on the Nova database column size to limit the size of the instance name. We should put in an API check on the instance name size/length before sending it off to the database.

Additionally, as part of this fix I would also like to incorporate a simple request size limiting middleware into our API pipeline so that really large requests are invalid to begin with.

---

This exploit could allow an authenticated user to run the Nova API server out of disk space.

Nova's rate limiting middleware will help guard the number of POST and PUT requests a given user can make. The default POST limit to /servers is 50 per day. The PUT limit is however much higher at 10 per minute. Either of these could provide opportunities to run API servers out of disk space.

I suspect this affects Diablo as well ?

Like for the Keystone issue, we don't really want the coordinated disclosure to interfere with our RC publication or final release...

If the request size limiting middleware works around the issue completely, would merging it innocently in Nova RC2 and working on disclosure asynchronously be an option ?

So...

The fix for the instance name issue is pretty simple:

+++ b/nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py

@@ -505,6 +505,10 @@ class Controller(wsgi.Controller):

             msg = \_("Server name is an empty string")

             raise exc.HTTPBadRequest(explanation=msg)

+ if not len(value) < 256:

+ msg = \_("Server name must be less than 255 characters.")

+ raise exc.HTTPBadRequest(explanation=msg)

I am however concerned that this same problem could occur in other places as well. We don't appear to validate the size of image snapshot names either for example. I haven't tested to see what Glance actually does with a 128M image name but it could cause problems...

---

Putting in middleware to limit the request size is fairly straightforward and shouldn't affect anything that I know of in the OSAPI (it would potentially affect the EC2 API but we can ignore it for this anyway). And it would globally guard against really large requests attacks.

I'm not sure it really belongs in nova's code base long term however. Both Apache and Nginx are quite capable of doing this already and most production deployments are probably using something similar for SSL or load balancing already.

In summary maybe it is a good short term solution... and long term we can move towards better validation in the OSAPI. We recently added some Validator middleware to EC2's API. Perhaps something similar would help with the OSAPI requests as well.

We could push a public fix for an innocent-looking "long server names trigger 500 error instead of 400" bug that would also silently fix this.

The issue being, as you mentioned, that it doesn't really address potential other affected areas.

ttx: So... what I told you on IRC about 257 char server names was incorrect. It appears that a request to set the server name to a value larger than 255 will silently truncate it... that is until it gets really large (Megs) and that is when SQL exceptions start getting thrown thus causing this issue.

Bottom line is to expose this the requests need to be really large.

@Russell: I don't like it either. The trick is that RC2 for Nova is likely to be ready on Thursday next week... and I would hate to delay it or re-roll it. I just don't see how we can make the coordinated release date align on such short notice. Or can we ?

We have three options:

1- File a public "server names over size should return 400" bug and fix it openly in RC2, then calmly do a CRD for stable/diablo

2- Propose the OSAPI server name length patch for coordinated disclosure and complete it just in time for RC2

3- Propose the server name patch AND the sizelimit middleware for coordinated disclosure and complete them just in time for RC2

My issue with solution (3) is that we would push all requests through the new sizelimiting middleware as the very last thing before RC2 publication... which sounds extremely risky to me, that late in the cycle, for the potential benefit of catching unknown other ways of abusing large requests. I'll let Vish decide, but with my release manager hat on, I'd -1 this.

If we don't push the sizelimit middleware in Essex anyway, then I'd rather do option (1) than option (2).

Other opinions ?

Proposed impact description:

Title: Long server names grow nova-api log files significantly

Impact: High

Reporter: Dan Prince

Products: Nova

Affects: All versions

Description:

Dan Prince reported a vulnerability in OpenStack Compute (Nova) API servers. By PUTing or POSTing extremely long server names to the OpenStack API, any authenticated user may grow nova-api log files significantly, potentially resulting in disk space exhaustion and denial of service to the affected nova-api nodes. Only setups running the OpenStack API are affected.

I vote for option 2, just because I think this practice of openly fixing security issues as something else less serious is poor practice. I'll defer to ttx for the final decision, though.

2 is ok. I still don't mind putting in the size middleware as an option so that deployers can turn it on if needed. But I'm fine doing it with a backport to stable/essex later.

How many other places in nova/elsewhere have this issue :-(

Seems like any buffer being read from input needs to be size limited and/or type checked before it hits the DB (which will also either chop off part of the string or fail at insertion time).
