Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `loginscript.php` file of the e-ticketing application. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `user_name` and `password` POST parameters before using them in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication by injecting SQL code to manipulate the login query.  This allows for unauthorized access to the application. The provided proof of concept demonstrates this by injecting a SQL query that bypasses the normal login procedure and authenticates as 'admin'.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `loginscript.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or prior access is needed to trigger this vulnerability
