The provided content is related to CVE-2012-1086. It's a security advisory from TYPO3 that details multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices within the third-party TYPO3 extensions. Specifically, it highlights a lack of proper input sanitization and validation leading to:
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper handling of user-supplied data in SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper escaping of user-supplied input when rendered in the browser, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposing sensitive information due to improper access controls or insecure handling of data.
*   **Open Redirection:** Allowing an attacker to redirect a user to an arbitrary web page.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Lack of protection against unauthorized actions made on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The following vulnerabilities are present:
*   SQL Injection
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Information Disclosure
*   Open Redirection
*   Arbitrary Code Execution
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of successful exploitation varies depending on the specific vulnerability:
*   **SQL Injection:**  Could allow attackers to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
*  **Open Redirection:** Could be used in phishing attacks or to redirect users to malicious websites.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Could allow attackers to take complete control over the webserver.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** All listed vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** Some XSS vulnerabilities may require a user to interact with a crafted link or form.
*   **Authenticated Access:** Some vulnerabilities require the attacker to be logged into the backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Extensions:** The attacker must know which extensions are installed and vulnerable.
*   **Backend Access (For some vulnerabilities):**  Some vulnerabilities require the attacker to be logged in to the backend of TYPO3.

**Vulnerable Extensions:**
The following extensions are listed as having vulnerabilities:
*   `css_filelinks`
*   `terminal`
*   `beuserswitch`
*   `rtg_files`
*   `irfaq`
*   `skt_eurocalc`
*   `jftcaforms`
*   `bc_post2facebook`
*   `aeurltool`
*   `mv_cooking`
*   `toi_category`
*   `mm_whtppr`
*    `sysutils`
*    `typo3_webservice`
*    `ya_googlesearch`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that some vulnerable extensions have been removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the lack of timely fixes from their authors.
*   The advisory provides links to updated versions of extensions when available.
*   CVSS v2.0 scores are provided for each vulnerability.
*   The advisory emphasizes the importance of subscribing to the `typo3-announce` mailing list to receive future security bulletins.
*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the `mv_cooking` extension vulnerability was being exploited in the wild.
