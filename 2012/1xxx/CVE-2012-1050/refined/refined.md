```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `*` wildcard in the `Location` directive of the Mathopd configuration is substituted with the value from the Host header provided by the client. This substitution happens after path translation, without proper input validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access files outside of the intended directory (e.g., `/var/www`) by manipulating the Host header to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious Host header containing directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Mathopd server."
