Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Windows Print Spooler service.
*   It is caused by the service's failure to properly handle specially crafted responses to its requests. This indicates a format string vulnerability, where user-supplied data is incorrectly handled during string formatting, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The core issue is that the Print Spooler service is susceptible to a format string vulnerability. This type of vulnerability occurs when a program uses a user-controlled string as the format string argument in functions like `printf`. This can lead to the program reading from or writing to arbitrary memory locations, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Complete System Control:**  An attacker can gain complete control of the system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** This control enables the attacker to perform various malicious activities, including:
    *   Installing programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creating new user accounts

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker without prior authentication.
*   **Specially Crafted Response:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted response to the print spooler's requests. This suggests that the print spooler makes some kind of request to an external or untrusted source, and the vulnerability exists in the way it processes the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the target system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target system.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Responses:**  The attacker needs the technical capability to create a specially crafted response that triggers the format string vulnerability in the print spooler.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `spoolsv.exe` (print spooler) service.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Windows Print Spooler service, which manages the printing process. This service is responsible for tasks such as retrieving printer drivers, spooling print jobs, and scheduling print jobs.
*   The vulnerability affects both workstations and servers.
*   The provided document also contains workarounds for the vulnerability, which include disabling the print spooler service.
*   The affected systems include Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
