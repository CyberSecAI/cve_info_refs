Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-1603:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of unsanitized user-submitted data within SQL queries in the `ajaxserver.php` file. Specifically, the `findUsers`, `isIdAvailable`, and `getGreetings` functions are affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-provided data from GET parameters (`curstr`, `id`, and `username`) is directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code. This could lead to a variety of impacts:
    *   **Data Breaches:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers may be able to escalate privileges within the database system.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Attackers may be able to disrupt the normal operation of the database or the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameters:** The attack vectors are the HTTP GET parameters:
    *   `curstr` parameter for `findUsers` function
    *   `id` parameter for `isIdAvailable` function
    *   `username` parameter for `getGreetings` function

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the NextBBS web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests with modified parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable functions are all located in the `ajaxserver.php` file.
*   The user-supplied parameters are URL-decoded before being used in the SQL queries, which makes it possible to inject malicious SQL via URL encoding characters such as single quotes (`'`).
*   The provided test cases show how using a URL-encoded single quote in the parameters results in SQL syntax errors.
