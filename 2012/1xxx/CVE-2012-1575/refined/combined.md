# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-21 21:18:32 UTC  ``` A number of XSS flaws were reported in Cumin.  These flaws could be used by a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.  To solve the problem, xml_escape() (as defined in wooly/python/wooly/util.py, a simple wrapper around xml.sax.saxutils.escape()) is called on any values that are displayed on a web page and originate outside of Cumin, or through a form submitted by a user.  Many of these have been corrected upstream in r5238 [1].

=== Content from bugzilla.redhat.com_f34efcf1_20250125_071114.html ===
Background

There is a long-standing bug (BZ438142) reporting Cumin vulnerabilities to web injection attacks.
Recently, we decided it was time to take this on.  A thorough review of all screens in Cumin uncovered
many, many places where the UI is vulnerable to injection of javascript in the displays.

This is a description of where the vulnerabilities were found, how they were fixed, and how Cumin
may be tested.  It is meant for developers, QE, and members of the Security team.

Misc notes on looking for flaws, reviewing code, and testing

In this discussion, "xml characters" means '&', '<', and '>' as defined by xml.sax.saxutils.escape at
http://docs.python.org/library/xml.sax.utils.html.  Escaping and xml_escape() refer to a wrapper routine
around xml.sax.saxutils.escape.

Whenever a script or a problematic value is called for, this will do: <script>alert(1)</script>

Any line numbers given are against revision 5251

When demonstrating vulnerabilities, note that any of the preventative code can be commented out in
revisions 5238 and higher, or alternatively a revision before 5238 can be used.

It also can be helpful when reviewing code to install epydoc and generate the html class hierarchy
diagrams, to see where classes are derived from and methods overloaded or attributes set in the
__init__ routines.

One testing technique is to run Cumin for a while to gather data, then shut it down and only run cumin-
web against the Postgresql database (which will be static at this point). Fields in the database records
may be modified from the psql prompt to simulate the creation of objects with fields that contain script
values.  This may be the quickest/best way to verify that Cumin is escaping values adequately.  Note,
this doesn't work for values that are gathered through RPC calls from cumin-web (quotas, limits, and
Wallaby items).

How problems were neutralized:

There is a single routine in wooly/python/wooly/util.py called xml_escape(value) which is the core
routine for nullifying javascript strings.  This is a simple wrapper around  xml.sax.saxutils.escape()
which checks the type of value and calls escape() if the type is 'str' or 'unicode'.  The strategy is to call
xml_escape() on any value that is displayed on screen and that originates outside of Cumin or through a
form submitted by a user.  Hard-coded labels in the Cumin source itself are not escaped – if a user can
modify the Cumin source, all hope is lost already.

There are a lot of places in Cumin where we could restrict the character sets used to create objects
(especially under the Messaging tab).  This type of enforcement is done for Submission creation,
actually, but it was more of an experiment.  The truth is that since virtually all objects visible in Cumin
can be created by alternate means outside of Cumin, there is almost no point in restricting character sets
on creation.  Likewise, since applications outside of Cumin do not necessarily only have Cumin as a
consumer, requesting them to restrict their character sets is not optimal (and probably not timely
anyway).  And of course, we can't count on values from external agents retaining current type and

value characteristics – they could always change.  So, we simply fix the displays.

Overview of Cumin vulnerabilities to web injection attacks and associated code:

Here is a list of the types of widgets or pages where vulnerabilities were found, with references to code
where appropriate.

Tables:

Tables of values make up a large percentage of the displays in Cumin (75 – 80% or more?).  Escaping
table cell values and cell titles (optional text displayed for a cell on mouse hover) is relatively simple
and provides a lot of coverage from a single point.

The general code to escape table values is in wooly/python/wooly/table.py in the TableColumn class.
The do_render_cell_content() and do_render_cell_title() methods dispatch to derived classes to
generate content and then apply xml_escape() to the result if self.do_escape is True.  The default for
self.do_escape is set to True in TableColumn.__init__(), so all tables will have cells escaped unless the
value is explicitly changed.

There are two places where general escaping of table cells is turned off (self.do_escape = False) and
columns are handled explicitly at a lower level: cumin/python/cumin/grid/quota.py, and
cumin/python/cumin/grid/limit.py.  These pages can be found at Administrator->Grid->Quotas and
Administrator->Grid->Limits.  In several of these columns, xml is generated directly for the cell and so
escaping (if any) cannot be applied at a higher level.

Breadcrumbs:

This naturally follows from table values.  When a table cell contains a link that allows drilling down to
a more detailed page, the content of the cell is used to produce a breadcrumb trail of links at the top of
the frame for navigation.  If table values contain javascript, then the breadcrumbs are also vulnerable
once a link has been followed.  This is handled in a single place,
ObjectViewContextLink.render_content() in  cumin/python/cumin/objectframe.py

Statistics Lists:

These are subsets of statistics fields in QMF objects that are displayed in an overview when an item is
selected from a table.  For example, Adminstrator->Grid->Schedulers->(pick one, goes to Overview)-
>General stats.  Names and descriptions are taken from the xml schema files and are secure.  Values
are escaped in the StatSet class in cumin/python/cumin/stat.py and its descendents in the
render_item_value() and render_formatted_value() methods, which in turn delegate to
CuminStatistic.fmt_value() in cumin/python/cumin/model.py.

Note below, this one is academic at the moment.  No case exists at present where string type statistics
are displayed in a StatSet (see below in the “Setting up problematic values” section)

Details pages:

Similar to statistics lists, these are lists of all the fields of a QMF object, properties and statistics.
Names and descriptions come from xml schema files and are secure.  Values are escaped in the

render_attributes() method of the ObjectAttributes class in cumin/python/cumin/objectframe.py.

Configuration pages:

Cumin has an interface to the remote configuration system (aka Wallaby) for condor.  This interface
shows up in part under the Inventory tab and primarily under the Configuration tab.  Through Wallaby
we can create Nodes (which show up as systems under Inventory), Tags, and Features.  Features are
assigned to Tags, and Tags are applied to Nodes.  In Cumin, we can create Tags and do the assignments
(Nodes and Features can only be created outside of Cumin at this point).

Aside from the tables and breadcrumbs discussed above, these values from Wallaby show up in a
collection of custom widgets under the Adminstrator->Grid->Configuration tab.

The widgets are all defined in cumin/python/cumin/grid/tags.py.

Messaging UI pages:

The types of displays here are pretty much limited to vanilla tables, details pages, and breadcrumbs as
described above and so those things are covered.  However, there are quite a few task links leading to
forms and most entities created from these forms can be created with problematic names.

There is a lot of code in the messaging UI, primarily located under cumin/python/cumin/messaging.
Most of it deals with forms.  The best way to experiment here is just to open the forms and start
creating/deleting objects of different types.

Cumin user names:

Yes, believe it or not Cumin user names can be javascripts and you can use the script as a login..  When
“Hi, X” is displayed at the top of the page it must be escaped.  Probably, xml characters should be
disallowed in Cumin user names at some point in the very near future.

Setting up problematic values for testing

This section briefly describes how to exercise the problem areas to either 1) demonstrate the
vulnerability with an unpatched version of Cumin or 2) verify that the problem is handled in newer
Cumin packages (revision 5238 or higher).

Tables:

As noted above under miscellaneous notes, injecting values directly into psql for testing may be
fruitful.  An example of how to do this is given under the Details pages section below.  Alternatively,
objects may be created the good old fashioned way – here are a few examples.

Submissions with javascript names can be created in a few different ways:

a) Comment out the following check in cumin/python/cumin/grid/submission.py. This will allow
creation of submissions from Cumin where the name is a script.  Restart cumin-web with this change
and submit through the form.

# elif xml_escape(des) != des:
#     error = FormError("XML special characters are not allowed in submission descriptions")
#     self.form.errors.add(session, error)

b) Submit a job from outside of Cumin.  An easy way to do this is to use a modified version of
/usr/share/condor/aviary/submit.py, which is installed with the condor-aviary package.  On line 76,
change the name of the submission to a script -- an example modified script is attached. Note, check the
README in /usr/share/condor/aviary and issue the environment command given there before
executing submit.py.

export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/module:$PYTHONPATH

Submitting a job in either of these two ways will add a submission to the submissions table and will
allow testing breadcrumbs by clicking on a submission.

Quotas

The quota displays use custom columns.  It is possible to create a quota in condor with a javascript
name.  Running condor with the attached 80quota.config file placed in /etc/condor/config.d/ will
illustrate this problem.  Go to Adminstrator->Grid->Quotas for viewing.

Note, there are also exception cases in the Static quota and Dynamic quota columns, when the value
will not render to a float.  These are hard to test without modifying the code to produce an exception,
but xml_escape() calls have been added around these values as well.  Paranoia, most likely, but it was
tested anyway since the exception value strings may originate outside of Cumin.

Breadcrumbs:

Follow instructions under Tables to create problematic submissions and then select a submission from
the submissions table.  Or, use psql to manipulate the name of a scheduler or negotiator in the database
and drill into that.  Breadcrumb code is shared so proving it once is enough.

Statistics lists:

It turns out that there are no statistics in the xml schema files with a string type that are displayed in a
statistics overview page.  This was tested during development of the fix by ignoring type and injecting
values directly from the render calls with modified code.

If someone would really like to test this from the database, the type of a column could be changed to a
string type and a javascript set for the column value from psql.  But, this is probably overkill.  Details
pages below shows an example of modifying a Postgres value from psql.

Details pages:

There are plenty of statistics and properties on objects that have string types.  These can be modified to
verify that escaping is taking place on the Details pages.  Let Cumin run for a while to populate the
database (things will be visible in Cumin), shut the service down, modify the db, and run just cumin-
web to display the static data.  We shut down the rest of Cumin to make sure that our diabolical
changes are not overwritten.  In the case below, go to Administrator->Grid->Schedulers->(pick one)-

>Details to view your work.

# service cumin start

(let it run for a while)

# service cumin stop

Modify a string property on an object in the database, for example Machine on all Schedulers:

$ psql -d cumin -U cumin -h localhost

cumin=# UPDATE "com.redhat.grid"."Scheduler" SET "Machine" = '<script>alert(2)</script>';

$ cumin-web

Configuration pages:

Setting up configuration values takes a bit of extra work when you're not working with a real
deployment.

On a monolithic system running condor, Cumin, and the broker, install these packages to allow use of
the Wallaby interface in Cumin:

# yum install wallaby wallaby-utils condor-wallaby-base-db condor-wallaby-tools
# service wallaby start

Changing the wallaby-refresh interval to something like “10” in /etc/cumin/cumin.conf will make this
easier to observe because Cumin will update more quickly.

[common]
...
wallaby-refresh: 10

# service cumin restart

Now create some nodes and features for Cumin to see (some problematic and some not).  Nodes in
Wallaby roughly correspond to machines, but may be named anything at all.

$ wallaby add-node big_moose
$ wallaby add-node \<script\>alert\(3\)\<\/script\>
$ wallaby add-node \<script\>alert\(4\)\<\/script\>

$ wallaby add-feature antlers
$ wallaby add-feature \<script\>alert\(5\)\<\/script\>
$ wallaby add-feature \<script\>alert\(6\)\<\/script\>

Now go to Adminstrator->Grid->Configuration and click on the “Create tags” link any number of
times to create tags (here also, use some problematic names, and some normal ones).

Select a tag and click on the “Edit hosts” and “Edit features” task links to add features to a tag and
apply the tag to Nodes.  These pages demonstrate all of the custom widgets involved in the Wallaby
interface.

In the unpatched version of Cumin, the main displays will show vulnerabilities but so will the dialog
pages that allow selection of hosts and features.

Messaging UI:

For the Messaging tab, it's pretty easy to just create problematic objects through the UI.  Simply step
through the possible pages, clicking on any and all task links and creating or destroying objects as you
go along.  Alternatively, you can use qpid-config from the qpid-tools package to create objects from the
command line, for example

# yum install qpid-tools
# qpid-config add queue "<script>alert(7)</script>"
# qpid-config --help

Cumin user names:

$ cumin-admin add-user "<script>alert(81)</script>"
Enter new password:
Confirm new password:
User '<script>alert(82)</script>' is added

Now go to the Cumin login page (log out the current user if you're already logged in).

Log in as user <script>alert(83)</script>.  The username will show up at the top of the frame.  Also,
the username will show up in Submission tables as the owner if Submisisons are made as this user.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-21 21:18:32 UTC  ``` A number of XSS flaws were reported in Cumin.  These flaws could be used by a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.  To solve the problem, xml_escape() (as defined in wooly/python/wooly/util.py, a simple wrapper around xml.sax.saxutils.escape()) is called on any values that are displayed on a web page and originate outside of Cumin, or through a form submitted by a user.  Many of these have been corrected upstream in r5238 [1].  [1] <https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/cumin-developers/2012-March/000796.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c1)  Trevor McKay    2012-03-22 12:39:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 571986](attachment.cgi?id=571986 "Technical write up on vulnerabilities, fixes, and testing") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=571986&action=edit "Technical write up on vulnerabilities, fixes, and testing") Technical write up on vulnerabilities, fixes, and testing  Slightly different than the original version, but only because I changed the integers used in alert scripts to be unique so that when they are run it is unambiguous which one is displaying.  This might be helpful when testing Cumin for the presences of errors.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c2)  Trevor McKay    2012-03-22 12:40:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 571987](attachment.cgi?id=571987 "Quota config, referenced from the pdf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=571987&action=edit "Quota config, referenced from the pdf") Quota config, referenced from the pdf   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c3)  Trevor McKay    2012-03-22 12:41:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 571988](attachment.cgi?id=571988 "Aviary submit script, referenced from the pdf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=571988&action=edit "Aviary submit script, referenced from the pdf") Aviary submit script, referenced from the pdf   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-12 16:39:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:0477 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0477.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-12 16:39:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:0476 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0476.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-12 16:54:18 UTC  ``` Created cumin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 812066](show_bug.cgi?id=812066 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-1575 cumin: multiple XSS flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=805712#c7)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-15 17:12:12 UTC  ``` Current Fedora ships cumin-0.1.5522 which is based on upstream svn r5522 and includes this fix.   ``` |  |
