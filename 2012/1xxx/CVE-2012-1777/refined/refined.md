Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `my.activation.php3` script, specifically within the "state" parameter. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.
*   **File System Access:** The MySQL database runs with root privileges and has FILE privileges enabled. This grants the attacker the ability to read and write arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Weak System Configuration:** The underlying Linux system is misconfigured, specifically the `/etc/sudoers` file has no password set, enabling privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands in the context of the administrative superuser ("root").
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read and write arbitrary files on the target file system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Due to the misconfiguration, an attacker can easily escalate to root privileges on the system.
*   **System Compromise:** Ultimately, the vulnerability leads to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based, unauthenticated**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network and does not require prior authentication.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request targeting the vulnerable script `my.activation.php3` and injecting malicious SQL within the 'state' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable F5 FirePass SSL VPN device.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need valid credentials for the system.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable script and parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects F5 FirePass SSL VPN versions 6.0.0 - 6.1.0 and 7.0.0.
*   A proof of concept exploit was developed, but not publicly released.
*   The advisory mentions that with the "into outfile" functionality of MySQL a webshell could be deployed to the server.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2012-02-03, and a hotfix was released on 2012-03-14.
