Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `author/edit.php` file of OpenConf versions 4.00 to 4.11. Specifically, the `$_POST['pid']` parameter, intended to hold the submission ID, is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query. Although the `safeSQLstr()` function is used, it does not protect against SQL injection because the user input is concatenated into the query string without proper single quotes around the value in the SQL query itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of proper quoting around the user-supplied `pid` parameter in the SQL query allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.  The exploit is "blind" because the attacker doesn't get to see the database output directly, but can infer results by observing the application's behavior (specifically, the "Submission ID or password entered is incorrect" error message).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by crafting specific SQL queries. In this example, the exploit code targets the `config` table to retrieve the chair's username and password hash. This information could allow unauthorized access to the administrative functionality of the application.
*   **Potential for further compromise:** Depending on database permissions, an attacker could potentially perform other malicious actions through SQL injection such as modifying data or even gaining shell access to the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `author/edit.php` page.
*   **Manipulated `pid` Parameter:**  The core of the exploit is injecting malicious SQL code into the `pid` parameter. The exploit constructs a SQL injection payload that uses boolean logic and substring functions to extract one character at a time of the password hash and username from the config table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable OpenConf installation.
*   **Enabled "Edit Submission":** The exploit relies on the "Edit Submission" functionality being enabled in the OpenConf configuration.
*   **Existing Paper record:** There must exist at least one record in the `paper` table, as the vulnerability is in the context of editing a submission.
* **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to have a valid user account to execute the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code includes a PHP script demonstrating how to extract the administrator's username and password hash via blind SQL injection.
*   The issue was fixed in OpenConf version 4.12.
*   The exploit leverages the error message "Submission ID or password entered is incorrect" to confirm the result of the blind SQL injection attempt.

This vulnerability is considered a **remote blind SQL Injection** vulnerability.
