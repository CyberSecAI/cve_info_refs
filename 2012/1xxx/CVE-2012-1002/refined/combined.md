# OpenConf 4.11 - '/author/edit.php' Blind SQL Injection

#### EDB-ID:

###### 18820

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  OpenConf <= 4.11 (author/edit.php) Remote Blind SQL Injection Exploit
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  author...............: Egidio Romano aka EgiX
  mail.................: n0b0d13s[at]gmail[dot]com
  software link........: http://www.openconf.com/
  affected versions....: from 4.00 to 4.11

  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | This proof of concept code was written for educational purpose only.    |
  | Use it at your own risk. Author will be not responsible for any damage. |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  [-] Vulnerable code in /author/edit.php:

  104.		// get sub
  105.		$anr = ocsql_query("SELECT * FROM `" . OCC_TABLE_PAPER . "` WHERE `paperid`=" . safeSQLstr($_POST['pid'])) ...
  106.		if (mysql_num_rows($anr) != 1) {
  107.			err(oc_('Submission ID or password entered is incorrect'));
  108.		}
  109.		$_POST = array_merge($_POST, mysql_fetch_assoc($anr));

  User input passed through $_POST['pid'] seems correctly sanitised by the safeSQLstr() function, but in the query
  at line 105,  single quotes aren't  used before  concatenate the user input  into the query string.  This can be
  exploited to conduct a  Blind SQL Injection  attack.  Successful exploitation of  this vulnerability requires at
  least a record into the 'paper' table, and 'Edit Submission' to be enabled.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Version 8.20 Release

We are pleased to release OpenConf 8.20. This update includes a number of usability improvements as well as some fixes, and we encourage all OpenConf 8 installations to upgrade.

Some of the new features include:

* Pre-installation verification of PHP version and extensions
* Ability for an account holder to join a committee after sign-up without Admin intervention
* Option for Admin to email notifications, when making bulk acceptance decisions, to just those submissions being changed
* Email recipient group for contacting submitters with an unedited submission
* Option to automatically set the submission acceptance decision to the advocate recommendation
* Optional display of authors in program and proceedings submission info pages using superscript numbers for organizations
* Shortcut links to program and proceedings (e.g., https://SERVER/openconf/program/)

For a full list of changes, check out the [Change Log](/documentation/changes.php).

Many of the new features above originated with client requests. We welcome your [suggestions](/contact/?to=suggestion) for improving OpenConf. If there is a must have feature that you require right away, we offer an [OpenConf Customization Service](/support/#customization-service).

## Version 8.10 Release

OpenConf 8.10 is a roll up of interim patches released for 8.00, and we encourage all version 8 installations be upgraded. Some new features are also included, such as:

* Weighted scoring for review form fields through the Custom Forms module. Individual review scores have been changed from an integer to a decimal value in support of this.
* Streaming of video files for browsers supporting Accept-Ranges:none.
* Temporary storage of automated review and advocate assignment parameters during Admin session.
* Experimental support for Cloudflare Turnsile CAPTCHA.
* New email recipient group to contact submitters missing IEEE copyright.
* Editing of additional built-in review form field values.
* Storage of modified header and footer when downloading Program or Proceedings.
* Filtering on type and decision when making submission assignments to Program sessions.
* Deletion of reviewer rebuttal by Admin.

For a full list of additions, changes, and fixes, reference the [Change Log](/documentation/changes.php).

## Version 7.41 and 8.00 Releases

We are super excited to announce the release of OpenConf 8! But wait...

Before we get to the really good stuff, we are also announcing the release of OpenConf 7.41. This includes updates for the most recent PHP versions and patches that have been incorporated into version 7.40 since its release.

The all new OpenConf 8 is an extensive redevelopment of OpenConf with a focus on usability and accessibility. The responsive design also makes it much more friendly for use on mobile devices. And the consolidation of various sign-in methods into one should make it easier for your users to access all features. This does mean authors will now be required to create an account before making a submission, however they will no longer have to separately sign-in to each author feature or remember their submission ID.

With the change to how authors sign-in, we are recommending that you continue to use OpenConf 7 if you already have the software installed or have an active OpenConf Hosting Service account. If you typically migrate settings from one year to the next, have created your own set of documentation, or have code customizations, you may also want to keep using OpenConf 7 a while longer. We will continue to make OpenConf 7 available for at least the next year.

OpenConf 8 will initially be available in the Plus and Professional Editions only. When purchasing a new license or hosting account, you will be able to specify what version you prefer (7 or 8). Due to the extensive changes, we do not recommend upgrading an existing installation from 7 to 8, however if you still want to, email our support team to change over your license version or if you have a question on what version to select. Note that OpenConf 8 now requires PHP 7.3+ (8+ recommended) and MySQL 8+.

A demo of OpenConf 8 is now available on our website. As with the OpenConf 7 demo, it is pre-populated with data, allowing you to quickly click through features, although without being able to make updates. The documentation in the Support section of our website has also been updated — see the revised Chair/Editor and Committee Member Guides, and new Submitter (Author) Guide, for navigating OpenConf 8.

Perhaps less exciting is our first base price increase in nearly ten years. This was something we had planned for before the pandemic due to increased costs, but with so many hard hit clients we decided to hold-off until things settled a bit. We still believe OpenConf is competitively priced and one of the best options available for abstract management and peer-review with outstanding support.

The changes in version 8 will make it much easier for us to roll out new features while maintaining OpenConf's ease of use. We already have a long list of enhancements that did not make this release, and also welcome your [suggestions](/contact/?to=suggestion "click for our contact form").

# # #

— OpenConf 8 Mini-FAQ: —

*Q: Can I keep using OpenConf 7?*

A: Yes. For at least the next year, we will continue to make OpenConf 7 available, and there is no impact to an already existing installation or account.

*Q: Can I upgrade or import settings from OpenConf 7 to OpenConf 8?*

A: Yes, however we do not recommend it. There are significant underlying changes and new options in OpenConf 8, so we are recommending that OpenConf 8 be installed for new events only and configured anew.

*Q: Is OpenConf 8 available in the Community Edition?*

A: At this time, OpenConf 8 is only available in the Plus and Professional Editions. OpenConf 7 will continue to be available in the Community Edition.

*Q: Will there be a price increase?*

A: Yes. This will be our first base price increase in nearly 10 years. We put off the increase due to the pandemic impacting so many of our clients, however we have continued to see our expenses grow.

*Q: What happens to the custom module OpenConf developed for our event?*

A: More than likely an update to the module will be required. Contact us at least a few weeks before you plan on using OpenConf for a new event, and we can let you know if an update is needed along with how long it will take to implement.

*Q: What are some of the key changes in OpenConf 8 I should be aware of?*

A: There are hundreds of changes, so picking just a few is hard, but let's try:

* Extensive interface and accessibility improvements
* Responsive design making mobile device use friendlier
* PHP 7.3+ and MySQL 8+ now required
* Chair no longer has to return to home page to access features
