Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) Network Threat Protection module when running on a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) webserver.
- The module misinterprets aggressive scanning from audit tools as a threat, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the overly aggressive response of the Network Threat Protection module to perceived threats.
- Specifically, it blocks all traffic to the server upon detecting "heavy scanning", rather than employing more nuanced threat mitigation techniques.
- This vulnerability exists in how SEP handles network traffic from vulnerability scanners.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The IIS web server becomes unresponsive, causing the server to stop serving pages.
- **Potential for Resource Exhaustion:** In some instances, the excessive resource use can lead to server hang or crash.
- The vulnerability does not impact the security of the Symantec Endpoint Manager, but only affects the availability of the web server components.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack is triggered by using vulnerability audit tools to scan the targeted server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
- No special authentication or privileges are required.
- The attacker needs to perform a "heavy scan" of the server using audit tools or similar.
- The attacker needs a way to scan or probe the target, and does not need to be on the local network.
