How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Symantec Endpoint Protection network threat protection module Microsoft IIS denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#149070

Original Release Date: 2012-06-05 | Last Revised: 2012-06-05

---

### Overview

Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) Network Threat Protection module running on a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) webserver contains a denial of service vulnerability when probed by an audit tool.

### Description

| Symantec Security Advisory [SYM12-007](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=2012&suid=20120522_00) states:  *OverviewVersions of Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager 11.0 running the Network Threat Protection module on Windows Server 2003 are susceptible to a Denial of Service(DoS). Successful exploitation could potentially result in the system hosting Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager becoming unresponsive to IIS-based web server requests until restarted.**DetailsSymantec was notified of a Denial of Service(DoS) within the Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager 11 RU6 and related maintenance packs. A successful exploitation is possible when using audit tools to aggressively scan the targeted Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager host. After a period of heavy scanning the Network Threat Protection module responds to the perceived threat by blocking all subsequent traffic to the server. This can lead the server to stop serving pages and in some instances can cause excessive resource use which can lead to a hang or crash of the server.This issue does not impact the security of the Symantec Endpoint Manager, only the availability of the web server components.*It has been reported that this vulnerability affects Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0, however newer versions could be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker can cause the Microsoft IIS webserver to become unresponsive leading to a denial of service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**The vendor has stated that this vulnerability has been addressed in SEP 11.0.7000 RU7 MP2. Users are advised to upgrade to release SEP 11.0.7000 RU7 MP2 or later. The vendor states that updates will be available through customers’ normal support/download locations. |
| --- |

| **Restart server or IIS service**The vendor has stated that manually restarting the server and/or IIS service will remedy the situation. |
