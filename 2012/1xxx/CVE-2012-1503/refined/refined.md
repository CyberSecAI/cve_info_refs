Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the comment section of Movable Type Pro 5.13en. Specifically, the application does not properly neutralize or encode HTML and JavaScript code when displaying comments, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is a persistent (or stored) XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application's database. Every time the comment is displayed, the injected script will be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the comment section.
- This code will be executed within the context of the victim's browser when they view the comment.
- A successful exploit could lead to:
   - Session hijacking by stealing cookies (as demonstrated in the provided exploit).
   - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
   - Potential administrative access to the blog if the malicious script targets a moderator viewing the comment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the blog comment submission form.
- The attacker injects the malicious script within the comment content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs the ability to post a comment on the vulnerable Movable Type instance.
- No special privileges or access is required initially.
- The vulnerability can be triggered whenever a user (including moderators) views a comment containing the malicious script.
