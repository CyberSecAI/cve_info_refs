{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various modules due to insufficient input validation.",
    "Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the alert module via the `?periods` parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can hijack user sessions (including administrators) via XSS, and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database via SQL injection. The SQL injection could allow for reading or modification of the database and potential further compromise of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Remote attackers can inject malicious scripts into vulnerable parameters in the application (e.g. `resourceid`, `attributeIDs`, `redirectto`, `restype`, `monID`, `resids`, `baseid`, `attids`, `listsize`, `attName`, `network`, `displayName`, `viewId`, `header`, `group`).",
    "Remote attackers can inject malicious SQL queries into the `?periods` parameter."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests with malicious payloads to the vulnerable application. This can be done remotely, with no special access privileges necessary."
