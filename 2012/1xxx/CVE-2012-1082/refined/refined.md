The provided content is related to CVE-2012-1082. This CVE is a placeholder for a collective security bulletin (TYPO3-EXT-SA-2012-001) which describes multiple vulnerabilities in several third-party TYPO3 extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices within the third-party TYPO3 extensions. Specifically, the issues are related to:
  *  Lack of proper input sanitization, leading to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
  *  Insecure handling of user input, resulting in open redirection vulnerabilities.
  *  Lack of access control, resulting in information disclosure vulnerabilities.
  *  Insecure code execution, resulting in arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The following vulnerabilities were identified across the listed extensions:
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modifications or deletion.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, and phishing.
*  **Open Redirection:** Allows attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, potentially used in phishing attacks
*   **Information Disclosure:** Allows attackers to gain access to sensitive information,
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies depending on the specific vulnerability and the extension:
*   **SQL Injection:** Full compromise of database, allowing an attacker to read, modify, or delete data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, and phishing.
*   **Open Redirection:** Phishing attacks, potentially leading to credential theft
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive information
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Full server compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** Vulnerabilities are exploitable over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** Some XSS vulnerabilities may require user interaction.
*  **Authentication:** Some vulnerabilities may require user authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Extensions:** Attackers need to know which extensions are vulnerable and how to exploit them.
*   **Authentication (in some cases):** Some vulnerabilities require the attacker to have valid user credentials
*  **User Interaction (in some cases):** Some vulnerabilities require the user to perform certain actions for the attack to succeed

**Vulnerable Extensions:**

The following extensions are listed as vulnerable in the bulletin:

*   `css_filelinks`
*   `terminal`
*   `beuserswitch`
*   `rtg_files`
*   `irfaq`
*   `skt_eurocalc`
*   `jftcaforms`
*   `bc_post2facebook`
*   `aeurltool`
*   `mv_cooking`
*    `toi_category`
*    `mm_whtppr`
*    `sysutils`
*   `typo3_webservice`
*   `ya_googlesearch`

**Additional Information:**

*   The security bulletin categorizes the vulnerabilities into Critical, High, Medium, and Low severity based on their potential impact.
*   For some extensions, patches or updated versions were released. For others, the extensions were removed from the repository due to the authors' failure to provide timely fixes. Users are advised to uninstall these extensions.
* The content mentions that the `mv_cooking` vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild.
