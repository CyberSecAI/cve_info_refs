Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory when a title element is changed. Specifically, it involves accessing an object that has already been deleted, which leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:**  The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. IE attempts to access memory associated with an object that has been deallocated, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This allows the attacker to install software, modify or delete data, and create new accounts with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website. This can be achieved via links in emails, instant messages or through compromised websites that host malicious content.
- **Embedded Malicious Content:** The vulnerability can be triggered by embedding malicious content in various mediums, including web pages, applications, and Microsoft Office documents that use the IE rendering engine through ActiveX controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website or interact with malicious content.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during a title element change in Internet Explorer.
- The memory corruption caused by the use-after-free can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.
- The vulnerability is present in Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, 8, and 9, affecting various Windows operating systems including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
