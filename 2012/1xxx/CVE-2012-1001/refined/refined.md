The provided content is related to CVE-2012-1001.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was caused by a lack of sanitization of user input before outputting it to the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user input. Specifically, the `$_POST['content']` variable was being directly outputted without any sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `content` parameter which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirect to malicious sites, or defacement of the page, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `$_POST['content']` parameter. By manipulating the POST data, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTML or Javascript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the affected endpoint with a malicious payload in the `content` parameter.
