Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from multiple insecure temporary file usage issues within the `iproute` package. Specifically, these issues were found in:

*   Checking for ATM technology support.
*   Checking for Xtables extension support.
*   Checking for setns() system call support.
*   An example `dhcp-client-script`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core weakness is the insecure creation and handling of temporary files. The programs create temporary files in a way that allows a local attacker to predict or control the file names and locations, leading to a race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A local attacker could exploit these flaws to conduct symbolic link attacks. This means they could create symbolic links pointing to arbitrary locations, and then by creating or modifying a file with that targetted name, could potentially overwrite or modify other files on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is local. A local user can exploit these issues by manipulating the environment where these scripts or programs run, creating symbolic links to other parts of the filesystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable `iproute` package is installed.
*   The attacker needs to have sufficient permissions to create symbolic links and write files.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The specific insecure temporary file use in the `configure` script is only used at package build time and does not affect users using binary packages provided by Red Hat.
*   The insecure temporary file use in the example `dhcp-client-script` is not included in iproute packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   The issue was addressed in Fedora releases of 15, 16 and 17.
*   The fix was not backported to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, as the impact on these versions was considered to be low.
