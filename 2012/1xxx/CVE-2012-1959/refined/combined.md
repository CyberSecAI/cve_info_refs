It was added at jorendorff's instructions. But I think it's bad. Maybe jorendorff can comment further?Group: core-security

This is pretty bad. The potential at this point depends on how important the security checks around native anonymous content are: if there's an sg:crit bug depending on that, then this is sg:crit. However, in the absence of any of those, the most I can make of this bug is an sg:moderate (tracking the location object).
The assertion here is pointing out that an inner window has been exposed directly to JS. That bug in and of itself is not exploitable: the inner window will be same origin for all time and the wrapper that goes away has no security characteristics in and of itself. The behavior would be odd, though.
The reason this is at least sg:moderate is because this bug allows you to remove the security wrapper around the location object. I have a patch that fixes the issue pointed out by Jesse's testcase, but I wonder if this means that we should tell the JS engine somehow about same-compartment wrappers so that JS\_WrapObject can do the Right Thing.

As I attach this patch, I wonder if the proper solution to this bug wouldn't be to get rid of the XPCNativeWrapper constructor in content altogether... That would be [bug 575002](/show_bug.cgi?id=575002 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Get rid of XPCNativeWrapper constructor in content"), already filed by jorendorff.

Possible fix
I would much prefer to teach the JS engine about same-compartment wrappers somehow. It seems like our whole setup here is pretty weak and we don't have a great way of enforcing invariants.
If you have the time, I'd be totally down to sit down and brainstorm something. If you're busy at the moment though (as I am), r=bholley for the mean time.

I'm a little queasy checking this patch in. While it isn't critical, the patch points pretty directly to the problem and how to exploit it.

Did the brainstorming of [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=737559#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Assertion failure: !proto->getClass()->ext.outerObject\"") ever happen?
Assuming no one has time to do violence to the JS engine at this moment, here are some other possible plans.
- We could fix it via [bug 575002](/show_bug.cgi?id=575002 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Get rid of XPCNativeWrapper constructor in content"), but IIUC that un-exposes the bug rather than
actually fixing it.
- We could create some busywork bug to do some API cleanup (make a jsfriendapi
function that does this particular kind of unwrapping) and fix it there, and
hope no one notices.
- We could do some API cleanup in this area and fold it into the direct proxies
patch in [bug 703537](/show_bug.cgi?id=703537 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement Harmony direct proxies"). No bad guy is going to read that whole patch. If we remove
the 3-line comment from this patch, it should blend in pretty well there.
- We can sit on this fix indefinitely.
Thoughts?

Or land as-is on May 21 on all the branches, shipping on June 5. Or even over the next weekend (may 25-27) to make sure it at least makes it into Beta 6 (building may 28) for some sanity testing.
Neither API cleanup nor implementing Harmony proxies are going to fly on the beta branch or ESR. The patch is going to be checked-in relatively exposed for a week or two no matter what we do so don't twist yourselves into a knot worrying about mozilla-central (unless there's a big gap between m-c and beta/esr check-ins, so don't do that).

Possible fix
[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): Firefox 4 wrapper/js rewrites
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
User impact if declined: users can be tracked on the web. Possibly worse exploits depending on whether add-ons using XPCNativeWrapper() can be abused
Fix Landed on Version: none yet, exploit fairly obvious from patch
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): remote possibility of breaking an add-on that was inadvertently relying on the security hole.
String changes made by this patch: none

This is kind of just a special case of [bug 754044](/show_bug.cgi?id=754044 "VERIFIED FIXED - Same-compartment security wrappers can be trivially bypassed by passing them to another compartment"), and this fix does no good in the general case. I think we might want to avoid drawing attention to this until we have a story over there.

Holding in the queue till May 21. We want this for our fifth beta, so that we have the opportunity to back out and test before release if necessary.Whiteboard: [sg:moderate] wait until May 21-27, then land everywhere → [sg:moderate] wait until May 21, then land everywhere

I have patches over in [bug 754044](/show_bug.cgi?id=754044 "VERIFIED FIXED - Same-compartment security wrappers can be trivially bypassed by passing them to another compartment"), though they're bigger than this fix. This fix doesn't do us much good in light of that bug. So we need to figure out how to proceed on all this stuff.

It sounds like our options are
1) Land this fix for FF13, but it doesn't cover the general case and draws attention to the issue
2) Land [bug 754044](/show_bug.cgi?id=754044 "VERIFIED FIXED - Same-compartment security wrappers can be trivially bypassed by passing them to another compartment") for FF13, take additional risk since it's a
3) Land [bug 754044](/show_bug.cgi?id=754044 "VERIFIED FIXED - Same-compartment security wrappers can be trivially bypassed by passing them to another compartment") for FF14, let it ride the train
This bug is sg:moderate, and [bug 754044](/show_bug.cgi?id=754044 "VERIFIED FIXED - Same-compartment security wrappers can be trivially bypassed by passing them to another compartment") is sg:crit. Option 1 doesn't seem like a very good option given what you've said, so it really comes down to Options 2/3 which depend upon a risk evaluation of [bug 754044](/show_bug.cgi?id=754044 "VERIFIED FIXED - Same-compartment security wrappers can be trivially bypassed by passing them to another compartment"). I'll comment there.

I agree that we should not land this. It only draws attention to the more general problem.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

## Details

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Firefox. This is a known

  issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be fixed in a

  later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

presume that with enough effort at least some of these
could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
CVE-2012-1949: Brian Smith, Gary Kwong, Christian Holler,
Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey,
and Kyle Huey reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 13.
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian
Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 13.
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher Mario
Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a mechanism
to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop to the
addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes the
address of the previously site entered to be displayed in
the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page. This
could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya used
the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode CVE-2012-1953:
Out of bounds read in ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor
CVE-2012-1952: Bad cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher Mariusz
Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the location
property. In this issue, calls to history.forward and
history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
through the context menu using a data: URL. In this issue,
context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show only this
frame", and "View background image") are disallowed in a
javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL, allowing for
XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher Mario
Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed in the
HTML feed-view using <embed> tag within the RSS
<description>. This problem is due to <embed> tags not
being filtered out during parsing and can lead to a
potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The flaw
existed in a parser utility class and could affect other
parts of the browser or add-ons which rely on that class to
sanitize untrusted input.
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher Arthur
Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony Payne
reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS, Mozilla’s
color management library. With a carefully crafted color
profile portions of a user's memory could be incorporated
into a transformed image and possibly deciphered.
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer Frédéric
Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header is ignored
when the value is duplicated, for example X-Frame-Options:
SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication occurs for unknown
reasons on some websites and when it occurs results in
Mozilla browsers not being protected against possible
clickjacking attacks on those pages.
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher Bill
Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher Matt
McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using the
certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers Mario
Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla allows
the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL, it is
possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution attack
using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1088)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2012-1948, CVE-2012-1951, CVE-2012-1952, CVE-2012-1953,
CVE-2012-1954, CVE-2012-1958, CVE-2012-1962, CVE-2012-1967)

A malicious web page could bypass same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
and execute arbitrary code with chrome privileges. (CVE-2012-1959)

A flaw in the context menu functionality in Firefox could allow a malicious
website to bypass intended restrictions and allow a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1966)

A page different to that in the address bar could be displayed when
dragging and dropping to the address bar, possibly making it easier for a
malicious site or user to perform a phishing attack. (CVE-2012-1950)

A flaw in the way Firefox called history.forward and history.back could
allow an attacker to conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user
into believing they are viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2012-1955)

A flaw in a parser utility class used by Firefox to parse feeds (such as
RSS) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. This issue could have affected
other browser components or add-ons that assume the class returns
sanitized input. (CVE-2012-1957)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled X-Frame-Options headers could allow a
malicious website to perform a clickjacking attack. (CVE-2012-1961)

A flaw in the way Content Security Policy (CSP) reports were generated by
Firefox could allow a malicious web page to steal a victim's OAuth 2.0
access tokens and OpenID credentials. (CVE-2012-1963)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled certificate warnings could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to create a crafted warning, possibly tricking
a user into accepting an arbitrary certificate as trusted. (CVE-2012-1964)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled feed:javascript URLs could allow output
filtering to be bypassed, possibly leading to a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1965)

The nss update RHBA-2012:0337 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
introduced a mitigation for the CVE-2011-3389 flaw. For compatibility
reasons, it remains disabled by default in the nss packages. This update
makes Firefox enable the mitigation by default. It can be disabled by
setting the NSS\_SSL\_CBC\_RANDOM\_IV environment variable to 0 before
launching Firefox. (BZ#838879)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.6 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill
McCloskey, Abhishek Arya, Arthur Gerkis, Bill Keese, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Bobby
Holley, Code Audit Labs, Mariusz Mlynski, Mario Heiderich, Frederic Buclin,
Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Matt McCutchen, Mario Gomes, and Soroush Dalili as
the original reporters of these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.6 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Details

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948),

[CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If

the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [14.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/14.0%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [14.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/14.0%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [14.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/14.0%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1)

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
\*
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman,
Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox
13.
\*
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher
Mario Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a
mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop
to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes
the address of the previously site entered to be displayed
in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page.
This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
\*
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya
used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-afte.r-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
o CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased o CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode o
CVE-2012-1953: Out of bounds read in
ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor o CVE-2012-1952: Bad
cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
\*
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward
and history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack through the context menu using a data: URL. In
this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show
only this frame", and "View background image") are
disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL,
allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher
Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed
in the HTML feed-view using tag within the RSS . This
problem is due to tags not being filtered out during
parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class
and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.
\*
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher
Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
\*
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony
Payne reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS,
Mozilla's color management library. With a carefully
crafted color profile portions of a user's memory could be
incorporated into a transformed image and possibly
deciphered.
\*
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer
Frederic Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header
is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication
occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it
occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected
against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.
\*
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher
Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher
Matt McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using
the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
\*
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers
Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla
allows the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL,
it is possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution
attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Description

Mozilla developer **Bobby Holley** found that same-compartment
security wrappers (SCSW) can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW, but have a filtering
policy built into them. When an object is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is
stripped off and, when the object is read read back, it is not known that SCSW
was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of SCSW. This could result in
untrusted content having access to the XBL that implements browser
functionality.

Sigh. They're totally fucked. I don't know how we didn't think of this before.
JS wrapping doesn't know about SCSWs. So our strategy is just inject them in places like NativeInterface2JSObject, and hope that nobody can actually touch the object.
This works, mostly. Occasionally we find a hole (see [bug 737559](/show_bug.cgi?id=737559 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Assertion failure: !proto->getClass()->ext.outerObject\"")). But while debugging CPG wrapper reparenting fallout, I realized that there's a simple workaround. Cross-compartment wrappers don't go through SCSWs in most cases, but rather have the filtering policy built directly into them. So when an object is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off. But when the object is read \_back\_, the JS engine has no idea that there was ever supposed to be a SCSW there. So it just says "hey, the underlying object here is in the same compartment we're wrapping for. No wrappers needed!"
With compartment-per-global (i.e. Nightly), this is super easy make happen. Just load up a trivial iframe, define the security-checked property on its contentWindow, and read it back again. Boom. I wrote a testcase to confirm that this works.
Without compartment-per-global (i.e. Aurora, Beta, ESR, and Release), it's a tiny bit trickier, since normally an origin only gets one compartment to play with. But this can be easily defeated by making the trivial iframe same-origin via document.domain (rather than by its true origin), which puts it in a separate compartment. I didn't write a testcase for this because it's 11pm and I'm tired, but I don't see why it wouldn't work just as well.
On Nightly, we recently upped the ante by making the Components object protected by SCSWs ([bug 735280](/show_bug.cgi?id=735280 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove the Components object's dependency on caps.")). So this would in theory give full Components access to web content. But thankfully, I don't think gabor ever got around to removing the old-style CAPS check (did you, gabor?). So I think we're safe there for now. But we're still sitting ducks as far as Location and SOWs are concerned.
So yeah, we need a story here. Pronto.

Some more thoughts:
Modulo moving all SCSW-ed objects into a "compartment of forbidden things", I think our only answer here is to add another wrap callback that lets spidermonkey apply SCSWs when the underlying object turns out to be same-compartment as the context. This shouldn't be too hard, and would prevent us from having to apply SCSWs manually (though we'd still need to remember to call wrap in the appropriate places).
The annoying part, though, is that we don't get the easy checking of invariants that assertSameCompartment gives us. I wonder if there's some way we could assert (in debug builds) that certain objects are only accessed through our special proxies. Maybe we trigger them to blow up by default, and have the SCSWs disarm()/rearm() them? I wonder if jorendorff has any ideas.

I think this probably should have the same security rating as [bug 737559](/show_bug.cgi?id=737559 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Assertion failure: !proto->getClass()->ext.outerObject\""). I kind of think that one is under-rated, though. There are probably nasty things that can be done to native anonymous content. Also, can't you sometimes read cookies out of window.location?

Actually, the "compartment of forbidden things" strategy... sounds pretty good -- going with the flow. New compartment means new global but perhaps that wouldn't break the things in this forbidden compartment or perhaps we could create a special "proxy global". Anyway, I know there is a timeliness to the present problem, but longer term a new compartment sounds attractive. <meme>Compartmentalize all the things!</meme>

Nope. It's [Bug 735281](/show_bug.cgi?id=735281 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - Remove the security check in XPCWrappedNative::CallMethod") and it's not very urgent to fix.

This distinction is the only reason for writing the code in this confusing manner. And I don't think we need it now that we have stopAtOuter.

Part 4 - Introduce sameCompartmentWrapObjectCallback. v1
I was going to ask if it made sense to simply use the preWrap hook (after moving the call above the compartment check), but realized that overloads the return value too much, so this is clearly the best strategy.

I'm not sure this change is as big as you think... WrapperFactory::PrepareForWrapping already outerizes, so any caller that needs an inner window here is already broken. That being said, if you do want to do this in a followup, please replace the XXXbholley with a TODO (bug #): and file a followup.

I've thought about this a bit more, and I don't think it makes sense to outerize in the same-compartment wrapping hook. We really just need it in that one place, and so it just adds overhead to do it on every wrap.
Another thing I realized is that the contract for same-compartment wrapping hooks is kind of crappy. We \_might\_ call them with an unwrapped object, but we might not (so the 'rewrap' part is a misnomer). Unfortunately, I don't think there's a great alternative. If we always unwrap before calling that hook, we won't be able to reuse any cross-compartment wrappers we've already computed (a rather common case, I suspect).
It doesn't affect us for now though (since the same-compartment wrapping hook just checks for WNs). I'm going to mention it in a comment though.

Would somebody mind addressing the risk of this bug? If

\* we land the fix on mozilla-beta on or before 5/21
we can still take the fix for FF13.

One other requirement for landing on FF13 is that we backport to the ESR in a low-risk fashion prior to our 5/1 final go-to-build.

So, I've thought about this a bit more.
Backporting to beta is tricky, because this bug also depends on the work that was done in [bug 739796](/show_bug.cgi?id=739796 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make same-origin cross-compartment location expandos visible in a compartment-per-global world"). And I'm not 100% sure that the work over there doesn't depend on anything else that I was doing in the flurry of patches I landed in march. That stuff is all on aurora now, which should make backporting easier, but it's not on beta.
I also think the security rating isn't entirely correct. The biggest threat here is that it allows the unwrapping of SOWs, which gives untrusted content access to the XBL that implements <video> controls and such. And given that we generally turned that off for the web, there are almost certainly sg:crits lurking there. But this isn't an sg:crit directly. The worst this is on its own is that it allows URIs to be read cross-origin, which allows attackers to read cookie strings, passwords, etc that happen to be in GET parameters.
So I'm going to compromise on sg:high, and suggest that we shouldn't take this for beta. I'm going to prepare an aurora patch now.Keywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---) → [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [sg:critical] → [sg:high]

Oh hm, there's still the ESR10 issue.
1 - Let it ride for ESR10.
2 - Port the refactor of same-compartment security wrappers: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=609924&action=diff>
3 - Write a new version of the wrapping callback that just manually applies the wrappers.

Note that these patches are associated with a very intermittent crash in [bug 758572](/show_bug.cgi?id=758572 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent crash during browser_bookmarks.js [@ xpc::WrapperFactory::WrapForSameCompartment]"). I'm pretty sure that this just exposes an existing bug, but I'm not sure.

We've got 5 more ESR-10 releases, would it be better to have code that's more like what's going on the trunk or a one-off tweak? Happy to have this fixed either way.

Try results are hard to interpret because it looks like the try builders aren't set up to deal with esr10. But I \_think\_ it looks ok.

Yes, unfortunately we don't have a solid way to get try ESR we can only rely on the builds/results post-landing.

Can someone please help me do the same for Firefox 14, 15, and ESR? I've never run mochitests before.

I did it by building my own Firefox and running the test after building it. Are you interested in building 14, 15, and ESR from hg?

That's not a problem for me, but I've never run mochitests before. Would you be willing to give me some direction or point me to some docs?

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes one version update.
Description:
MozillaFirefox have been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The ollowing security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
\*
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman,
Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox
13.
\*
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher
Mario Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a
mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop
to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes
the address of the previously site entered to be displayed
in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page.
This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
\*
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya
used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-afte.r-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
o CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased o CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode o
CVE-2012-1953: Out of bounds read in
ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor o CVE-2012-1952: Bad
cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
\*
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward
and history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack through the context menu using a data: URL. In
this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show
only this frame", and "View background image") are
disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL,
allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher
Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed
in the HTML feed-view using tag within the RSS . This
problem is due to tags not being filtered out during
parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class
and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.
\*
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher
Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
\*
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony
Payne reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS,
Mozilla's color management library. With a carefully
crafted color profile portions of a user's memory could be
incorporated into a transformed image and possibly
deciphered.
\*
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer
Frederic Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header
is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication
occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it
occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected
against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.
\*
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher
Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher
Matt McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using
the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
\*
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers
Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla
allows the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL,
it is possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution
attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=840212#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-14 12:08:37 UTC  ``` Mozilla developer Bobby Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment. Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW, but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and, when the object is read read back, it is not known that SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access to the XBL that implements browser functionality.  Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-49.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Mozilla developer Bobby Holley as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=840212#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-07-17 18:57:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1089 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1089.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=840212#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-07-17 19:28:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1088 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1088.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

USN-1509-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides an updated

ubufox package for use with the lastest Firefox.

Original advisory details:

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

Matt McCutchen discovered a clickjacking vulnerability in the certificate

warning page. A remote attacker could trick a user into accepting a malicious

certificate via a crafted certificate warning page. ([CVE-2012-1964](/security/CVE-2012-1964))

Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili discovered that javascript was not filtered out

of feed URLs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an

attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks. ([CVE-2012-1965](/security/CVE-2012-1965))

A vulnerability was discovered in the context menu of data: URLs. If the user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2012-1966](/security/CVE-2012-1966))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Firefox. This is a known

  issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be fixed in a

  later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=840214#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-14 12:22:52 UTC  ``` Bugzilla developer Frédéric Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options" header is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN". This duplication occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.  Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-51.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Mozilla developer Frédéric Buclin as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=840214#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-07-17 18:57:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1089 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1089.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=840214#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-07-17 19:28:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1088 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1088.html>   ``` |  |
