{
  "CVE-2012-1959": {
    "Description": "Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
    "Root cause": "Same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment. Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and when the object is read back, it is not known that SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of SCSW.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Bypassing of same-compartment security wrappers.",
      "Lack of enforcement of invariants in JS engine."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Tricking user into opening a specially crafted page.",
        "Loading a trivial iframe and defining security-checked property on its contentWindow and reading it back.",
        "Loading a trivial iframe with same origin via document.domain."
    ],
   "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious webpage."
  }
