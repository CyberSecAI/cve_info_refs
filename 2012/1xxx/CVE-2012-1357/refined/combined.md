System Requirements

Several new hardware and software features are introduced for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch and
the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender (FEX) to improve the performance, scalability, and
management of the product line. Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1 also supports all hardware and software
supported in Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0 and Cisco NX-OS Software Release 4.2.

Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches

The Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches include a family of line-rate, low-latency, lossless 10-Gigabit
Ethernet, Cisco Data Center Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and native Fibre Channel
switches for data center applications. The Cisco Nexus 5000 Series includes the Cisco Nexus 5500
Platform and the Cisco Nexus 5000 Platform.

For information about the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and Cisco Nexus
5500 Platform Hardware Installation Guide.

Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders

The Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender (FEX) is a highly scalable and flexible server networking
solution that works with the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches to provide high-density and low-cost
connectivity for server aggregation. Scaling across 1-Gigabit Ethernet, 10-Gigabit Ethernet, unified
fabric, rack, and blade server environments, the FEX is designed to simplify data center architecture and
operations.

The FEX integrates with its parent Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch which allows zero-touch
provisioning and automatic configuration. The FEX provides a single point of management that supports
a large numbers of servers and hosts that can be configured with the same feature set as the parent Cisco
Nexus 5000 Series switch, including security and quality of service (QoS) configuration parameters.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is not required between the Fabric Extender and its parent switch, because
the Fabric Extender and its parent switch allow you to enable a large multi-path, loop-free, active-active
topology.

Software is not included with the Fabric Extender. Cisco NX-OS software is automatically downloaded
and upgraded from its parent switch. For information about configuring the Cisco Nexus 2000 FEX, see
the “Configuring the Fabric Extender” chapter in the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Layer 2 Switching
Configuration Guide.

Cisco FabricPath

Cisco FabricPath is a set of multipath Ethernet technologies that combine the reliability and scalability
benefits of Layer 3 routing with the flexibility of Layer 2 networks, which enables it to build scalable
data centers. Cisco FabricPath offers a topology-based Layer 2 routing mechanism that provides an
equal-cost multipath (ECMP) forwarding model. Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) supports one
FabricPath topology.

The FabricPath feature provides the following:

(cid:129) Allows Layer 2 multipathing in the FabricPath network.

(cid:129) Provides built-in loop prevention and mitigation with no need to use the Spanning Tree Protocol

(STP).

(cid:129) Provides a single control plane for unknown unicast, unicast, broadcast, and multicast traffic.

(cid:129) Enhances mobility and virtualization in the FabricPath network.

The FabricPath network uses the Layer 2 Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol
to forward traffic in the network using the FabricPath headers. Layer 2 IS-IS is different than Layer 3
IS-IS; the two protocols work independently. Layer 2 IS-IS requires no configuration and becomes
operational when you enable FabricPath on the device. The frames carry the same FTag that is assigned
at ingress throughout the FabricPath network, and Layer 2 IS-IS allows all devices to have the same view
of all the trees built by the system. Known unicast traffic uses the Equal Cost Multipath Protocol (ECMP)
to forward traffic throughout the network. The system automatically load balances traffic throughout the
FabricPath network by using ECMP and the trees.

Cisco FabricPath is supported on all Cisco Nexus 5500 switches (N5K-C5596UP-FA,
N5K-C5548UP-FA, and N5K-C5548P-FA). The switch must be running Cisco NX-OS Release
5.1(3)N1(1). In addition, Cisco FabricPath requires the Enhanced Layer 2 license. For licensing
information, see the License and Copyright Information for Cisco NX-OS Software document.

Cisco TrustSec

Adapter FEX

For detailed information about Cisco FabricPath, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS FabricPath
Configuration Guide.

New and Changed Features

The Cisco TrustSec security architecture builds secure networks by establishing clouds of trusted
network devices. Cisco TrustSec also uses the device information acquired during authentication for
classifying, or coloring, the packets as they enter the network. This packet classification is maintained
by tagging packets on ingress to the Cisco TrustSec network so that they can be properly identified for
the purpose of applying security and other policy criteria along the data path. The tag, also called the
security group tag (SGT), allows the network to enforce the access control policy by enabling the
endpoint device to act upon the SGT to filter traffic.

For more information about Cisco TrustSec, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Security
Configuration Guide.

Cisco is introducing Adapter-FEX support on the Cisco Nexus 5500 platform and on Cisco Nexus 2200
FEXes that are connected to a Cisco Nexus 5500 parent switch. The Cisco NX-OS Adapter-FEX feature
provides the advantages of the FEX Link architecture with that of server I/O virtualization to create
multiple virtual interfaces over a single Ethernet interface. This allows the deployment of a dual port
NIC on the server and the ability to configure more than two virtual interfaces that the server sees as a
regular Ethernet interface. The advantage of this approach is a reduction of power and cooling
requirements and a reduction of the number of network ports.

The Adapter-FEX implementation is designed to work on a variety of FEX-capable adapters including
the Cisco adapter for Cisco UCS C-Series Platform (UCS P81E VIC) and third-party adapters that
implement VNTag technology. For additional, see Cisco UCS C-Series documentation.

Adapter-FEX supports FCoE when a VIC-enabled adapter is attached to a Cisco Nexus 2000 FEX or
directly to a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch.

Adapter-FEX at the access layer needs a FEX-enabled adapter in a server that connects to a parent switch
that supports Adapter-FEX functionality. There are two adapters that support Adapter-FEX
functionality:

(cid:129) Cisco UCS P81E Virtual Interface Card

(cid:129) Broadcom NIV Adapter

Note

Adapter FEX does not support SPAN and cannot be used as a SPAN source.

For detailed information about Adapter-FEX, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Adapter-FEX
Configuration Guide.

VM-FEX

The VM-FEX is an extension of the FEX that extends to the VIC virtual interface card (VIC) in the
server. It simulates ports and enables a high-speed link between the switch and the server. The VM-FEX
consolidates the virtual and physical network. Each VM gets a dedicated port on the switch. In addition,
the VM-FEX provides for vCenter management of Adapter-FEX interfaces.

The VM-FEX solution provides the following benefits:

New and Changed Features

(cid:129) Policy-based VM connectivity

(cid:129) Mobility of network and security properties

(cid:129) A nondisruptive operation model

VM-FEX does not support SPAN and cannot be used as a SPAN source.

VM-FEX does not support FCoE in NPV mode. Support for this feature will be available when
CSCts09434 is resolved, which is expected in the next maintenance release of VMware ESX 5.0.

For more information about VM-FEX, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Layer2 Switching
Configuration Guide.

Support for FCoE on a Dual Homed FEX

The Cisco Adapter FEX with FCoE feature allows you to create an FCoE connection to a Cisco Nexus
2000 Series Fabric Extender (FEX), which can then establish an FCoE connection to a server with a
virtual interface card (VIC) adapter. The switch connects to the FEX through a virtual port channel (vPC)
while the FEX connects to the server using a standard FCoE link between the FEX and the VIC adapter.

If you are using Enhanced vPC, the FEX can be associated with one and only one Cisco Nexus 5000
fabric for FCoE forwarding.

If you are using FabricPath, you must use a dedicated link for FCoE traffic.

If you are using a Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Server with a Cisco UCS P81E Virtual Interface
Card (VIC):

(cid:129) The VIC must be configured in Network Interface Virtualization (NIV) mode, which makes the two

unified ports appear to the system as virtual host bus adapters (vHBAs).

(cid:129) The VIC cannot be connected to the FEX through a VNP port. If this type of connection is used,

NIV mode cannot be enabled on the VIC.

(cid:129) The NIC mode on the Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Server must be set to active-standby.

(cid:129)

If you deploy FCoE over Adapter FEX on a server with a Cisco UCS P81E Virtual Interface Card
(VIC) and that is running Windows 2008, you must install new versions of software drivers.

For more information about support for FCoE on Dual Homed FEX, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series
NX-OS Fibre Channel over Ethernet Configuration Guide.

Control Plane Policing (CoPP) provides QoS-based prioritization and protection of control plane traffic
that arrives at the switch in the data plane, which ensures network stability, reachability, and packet
delivery.

Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) provides several predefined CoPP policies that administrators can
deploy for different environments. In these predefined CoPP policies, the classification of flows is
predetermined and the policing rates for the flows is fixed. In addition, there is one flexible CoPP policy
for cases where predefined policies do not address the needs of the deployment.

The CoPP implementation on Cisco Nexus 5500 Series switches provides three predefined COPP

New and Changed Features

(cid:129) Customized Policy

The CoPP policies can be changed at run time like any other QoS configuration. Classification of flows
is predetermined and cannot be modified. Policing rates for the flows is fixed and cannot be modified.

For additional information about CoPP, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration
Guide.

Enhanced vPC Support

Enhanced vPC (EvPC) provides a uniform access layer for any server to any FEX in hybrid deployments.
In addition, EvPC provides data, control plane, and management plane redundancy. A new vPC option
allows port channel connectivity to dual-homed FEXes.

The Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender (FEX) that contains the port assigned to the vPC must be
associated with the Cisco Nexus switch.

The CNA must be attached to the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series FEX rather than directly to the Cisco Nexus
5000 Series switch.

If you want to ensure backward compatibility for all previous configurations and supported topologies,
you must configure the FEX in a straight-through FEX topology that does not use Enhanced vPC.

Note

Enhanced vPC does not support SPAN and cannot be used as a SPAN source.

For more information about EvPC, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide.

IP ARP Synchronization

Management SVI

Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) introduces the ip arp synchronize command.When this command is
enabled, faster convergence of address tables between the vPC peers is possible. This convergence is
designed to overcome the delay involved in ARP table restoration when the peer-link port channel flaps
or when a vPC peer comes back online.

Enabling ARP synchronization improves convergence times during the restart of a vPC peer when a
Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch acts as a default gateway. By default, ARP synchronization is not
enabled.

For more information about IP ARP sync, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Layer 2 Switching
Configuration Guide.

A switch virtual interface (SVI) is a VLAN of switch ports represented by one interface to a routing or
bridging system. The SVI can be configured for routing, in which case it supports Layer 3 protocols for
processing packets from all switch ports associated with the VLAN, or for in-band management of the
switch.

Starting with Release 5.1(3)N1(1), the NX-OS switch has specific support for management SVIs.
Having different SVIs for routing and management separates data traffic from management traffic,
which can reduce competition for routing resources. If you are using an SVI for management purposes,
we recommend that you specifically configure your SVI for management using the management
command so that you can take advantage of this added functionality.

With this change, there are new guidelines and limitations for routed SVIs:

OL-25823-02

11

New and Changed Features

(cid:129) Although the CLI does not prevent you from configuring routing protocols on a management SVI,

we recommend that you do not configure them on management SVIs.

(cid:129) Routed SVIs that are being used for management (that is, routed SVIs that have not been specifically
configured for management using the management command) can still be used for management as
long as the Layer 3 license is not installed.

(cid:129) Management SVIs do not support configuration synchronization mode (config-sync). Configuration

synchronization is performed using the mgmt 0 interface.

(cid:129) RACL is not supported. Use VACL to filter the management traffic.

For more information about management SVIs, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Layer 2
Switching Configuration Guide.

New Software Features—Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches

Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) supports the following new software features on all Cisco Nexus
5000 Series switches:

(cid:129) ERSPAN, page 12

(cid:129) Multicast VLAN Registration, page 13

(cid:129) Port Security, page 13

(cid:129) Boot from SAN with vPC, page 13

(cid:129) Config-Sync Enhancements, page 13

(cid:129) SNMP over IPv6, page 14

(cid:129) Support for Eight Syslog Servers, page 14

ERSPAN

Encapsulated Remote Switched Port Analyzer (ERSPAN) introduces an additional level of flexibility to
the powerful network monitoring capabilities of SPAN and RSPAN. ERSPAN allows the analyzer to be
placed on one location and multiple switches can send mirrored traffic to this analyzer. Traffic from any
port on the network on any remote switch can be analyzed without physically moving the analyzer tool.

(cid:129) ERSPAN encapsulates SPAN traffic to IP-GRE frame format and allows remote monitoring traffic

over an IP network.

(cid:129) All Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches, including Cisco Nexus 5500 switches, support ERSPAN.

(cid:129) Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) supports an ERSPAN source session only; there is no support for

an ERSPAN destination session. The Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch hardware cannot
deencapsulate an ERSPAN frame.

(cid:129) ERSPN does not require a Layer 3 module and Layer 3 license.

(cid:129) The Cisco Nexus 5010 and Nexus 5020 switches support two active ERSPAN sessions. The Cisco
Nexus 5548P, Nexus 5548UP, and Nexus 5596UP switch support four active ERSPAN sessions.

For more information about ERSPAN, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS System Management
Configuration Guide.

Multicast VLAN Registration

New and Changed Features

Port Security

Multicast VLAN Registration (MVR) allows a Layer 2 switch to deliver a multicast packet received from
one VLAN to multiple receivers that reside in different VLANs, without Layer 3 replication.

MVR offers the following advantages:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

It reduces the overhead of Layer 3 multicast replication on a multicast router.

It reduces the bandwidth consumption for the link between the Layer 2 switch and the multicast
router.

It reduces the multicast forwarding table size on the Layer 2 switch.

All models of Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches support MVR.

For more information about MVR, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Layer 2 Switching
Configuration Guide.

Port security is a simple Ethernet MAC-based security feature that can restrict input to an interface by
limiting and identifying MAC addresses of the end host that are allowed to access the port. Cisco NX-OS
Release 5.1(3)N1(1) adds port security to the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and Cisco Nexus 2000 Series,
and it is available on both Cisco Nexus 5000 and Nexus 5500 switches. Port security supports the
following features:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

It supports both physical ports and port channels.

It supports vPC ports for the first time in Cisco NX-OS, and only in the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series.
(Port security support for vPC ports is not available in the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series, although the
port security feature itself is supported on that platform.)

It supports EvPC ports.

It does not support NIV ports.

A device maximum of 8192 secure MAC addresses in addition to one MAC address per port is supported.
The interface maximum is 1025 MAC addresses per interface.

For additional information about the port security feature, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 NX-OS Security
Configuration Guide.

Boot from SAN with vPC

Cisco Nexus Series 5000 switches support SAN boot with vPC. A VFC interface must be bound to a vPC
member physical interface (and not to the vPC port-channel interface itself) for a SAN boot to occur.

For more information about SAN boot with vPC, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Fibre Channel
over Ethernet Configuration Guide.

Config-Sync Enhancements

Config-sync allows you to synchronize the configuration between a pair of vPC switches. It eliminates
downtime due to vPC inconsistencies, simplifies vPC operations, and reduces administrative overhead.

The enhancements to config-sync in Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) remove the port channel
configuration restriction that previously existed. All port channels and member interfaces should be
configured inside a switch profile.

Upgrading or Downgrading to a New Release

For more information about config-sync enhancements, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Layer

SNMP over IPv6

Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) supports SNMP over IPv6.

For more information, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration
Guide.

Support for Eight Syslog Servers

In Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1), you can configure up to eight syslog servers. You use the Cisco
Fabric Services (CFS) to distribute the syslog server configuration; however, CFS distribution of the
syslog server configuration is limited to three servers.

For more information, see the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration
Guide.

Upgrading or Downgrading to a New Release

This section describes the upgrade and downgrade paths that are supported for Cisco NX-OS
Release 5.1(3)N1(1a) and Release 5.1(3)N1(1) on the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch.

This section includes the following topics:

Upgrade and Downgrade Guidelines

The following guidelines apply to Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1a) and Release 5.1(3)N1(1) for the
Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches:

(cid:129) When a Layer 3 license is installed, the Cisco Nexus 5500 Platform does not support an ISSU. Hot

swapping a Layer 3 module is not supported.

Note

An upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(x) to Release 5.1(x) is disruptive. This upgrade path requires
that you upgrade in steps from Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(x) to Release 5.0(3)x to Release 5.1(3)x.

Note

Following an upgrade to Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1a) on a Cisco Nexus 5000 or 5500 Series
switch, the vlan configuration is added to the running configuration. This change appears if the upgrade
is nondisruptive or disruptive. The addition of the vlan configuration is the result of the conversion of
some CLI commands in an older version of Cisco NX-OS software to a newer version. The operation of
the switch is not affected by the vlan configuration being a part of the running configuration.

Limitations

This section describes the limitations for Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1).

(cid:129) When upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and earlier releases to any release, the
policy description is lost. This problem does not occur when upgrading from Cisco NX-OS
Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and later releases. After an upgrade, we recommend that you reconfigure the
policy description. For details, see CSCth14225.

(cid:129) Starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N2(1), LACP fast timers are supported. If you downgrade
to an earlier release that does not support this feature, entering the install all command displays the
following warning:

"Configuration not supported - Lacp fast rate is enabled",
  "Use \"lacp rate normal\" on those interfaces"

Before downgrading to an earlier release, change the LACP rate to normal. If you ignore the warning
and force the installation, then it is possible that the leftover LACP rate fast configuration would
still be active with previous releases of software but the behavior would be unpredictable and link
flap might occur. We recommend that you change the LACP rate setting to normal. For details, see
CSCth93787.

OL-25823-02

15

Limitations

(cid:129) When an FC SPAN destination port is changed from SD to F mode and back to SD mode on a NPV
switch, the port goes into an error-disabled state. Perform a shut/no-shut after the mode change
recovers the port. This issue occurs only in NPV mode. For details, see CSCtf87701.

(cid:129)

If you configure a Cisco Nexus 2248TP port to 100 Mbps instead of autonegotiation, then
autonegotiation does not occur, which is the expected behavior. Both sides of the link should be
configured to both hardwired speed or both autonegotiate.

no speed—Autonegotiates and advertises all speeds (only full duplex).

speed 1000—Autonegotiates only for a 802.3x pause.

speed 100—Does not autonegotiate; pause cannot be advertised. The peer must be set to not
autonegotiate and fix at 100 Mbps (similar to the N2248TP)

For details, see CSCte81998.

(cid:129) Given the implementation of a single CPU ISSU, the STP root on the PVST region with switches on
an MST region is not supported. The PVST simulation on the boundary ports go into a PVST SIM
inconsistent blocked state that breaks the STP active path. To work around this issue, move all STP
roots to the MST region. However, the workaround causes a nondisruptive ISSU to fail because
non-edge designated forwarding ports are not allowed for an ISSU. For additional information, see
CSCtf51577. For information topologies that a nondisruptive upgrade is supported, see to the Cisco
Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Upgrade and Downgrade Guide.

(cid:129)

IGMP queries sent in CSCtf94558 are group-specific queries that are sent with the destination
IP/MAC address as the group's address.

GS queries are sent for IP address: 224.1.14.1 to 224.1.14.100 [0100.5E01.0E01 to
0100.5E01.0E64]

These are not link-local addresses. By default, they are not flooded by the hardware into the VLAN.
They are sent only to the ports that have joined this group.

This is expected behavior during an ISSU.

In another scenario, the IGMP global queries [dest IP 224.0.0.1] get flooded correctly in the VLAN.

Group-specific queries are not forwarded to ports other than the one that joined the group during
ISSU. The reason to forward group-specific queries toward hosts is to avoid having them leave the
group. However, if a port has not joined the group, then this is not an issue. If there is an interface
that has joined the group, then the queries are expected to make it to the host. While the behavior is
different when ISSU is not occurring, it is sufficient and works as expected and there is no impact
to traffic. For details, see CSCtf94558.

(cid:129) The meaning of an MTU configuration has changed in Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and

earlier releases. In releases earlier than Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1), the configured MTU
included the Ethernet payload and Ethernet headers. In Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1), the
configured MTU includes only the Ethernet payload and not the Ethernet headers. When upgrading
or downgrading between Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and earlier releases, Cisco NX-OS
automatically converts the configuration to address this semantic change by adding or subtracting
38 to the MTU to address the Ethernet header size.

In a vPC configuration, the MTU per class needs to be consistent on both switches in the vPC
domain for the vPC peer link to come up. When upgrading/downgrading a working vPC setup
between pre-4.2(1)N1(1) and 4.2(1)N1(1) releases, the MTU is adjusted to make sure that the MCT
peer-link always comes up.

However if you add a peer-link between two switches in a vPC domain that are identically
configured (MTU in particular) with one switch running Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and
another switch running an earlier release, then the vPC peer link does not come up because the MTU
is inconsistent between the two switches.

16

Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Release Notes, Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1a) and Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1)
OL-25823-02

Limitations

This is not an issue when upgrading or downgrading peer switches in a vPC domain; this is only an
issue when adding a peer link between two switches running Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and
earlier releases that were not previously in the same vPC domain.

To resolve this issue, upgrade or downgrade one switch to match the version on the other switch and
reconfigure the MTU to be consistent on both sides. For details, see CSCtg27538.

(cid:129) The channel-group configuration is not applied to the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series downlink interface
after downgrading to the Cisco NX-OS Release 4.1(3)N1(1) software. This issue occurs if the speed
1000 command is present under the context of the port channel. To work around this issue,
reconfigure the channel-group command after the system comes up and reapply the configuration
from the saved configuration in the bootflash. For details, see CSCtc06276.

(cid:129) When a private VLAN port is configured as a TX (egress) SPAN source, the traffic seen at the SPAN

destination port is marked with the VLAN of the ingressed frame. There is no workaround.

(cid:129)

In large-scale configurations, some Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders may take up to 3
minutes to appear online after entering the reload command. A configuration can be termed large
scale when the maximum permissible Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders are connected to a
Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, and all host-facing ports are connected and each host-facing
interface has a large configuration (that supports the maximum permissible ACEs per interface).

(cid:129) The Cisco Nexus 2000 Fabric Extender does not support PVLANs over VLAN trunks used to

connect to another switch. The PVLAN trunks are used only on inter-switch links but the FEX ports
are only meant to connect to servers. Because it is not a valid configuration to have an isolated
secondary VLAN as part of a Fabric Extender port configured as a VLAN trunk, all frames on
isolated secondary VLANs are pruned from going out to a FEX.

(cid:129) Egress scheduling is not supported across the drop/no-drop class. Each Fabric Extender host port

does not support simultaneous drop and no drop traffic. Each Fabric Extender host port can support
drop or no drop traffic.

(cid:129) The Cisco Nexus 2148 Fabric Extender does not support frames with the dot1p vlan 0 tag.

(cid:129) VACLs of more than one type on a single VLAN are unsupported. Cisco NX-OS software supports
only a single type of VACL (either MAC, IPv4, or IPv6) applied on a VLAN. When a VACL is
applied to a VLAN, it replaces the existing VACL if the new VACL is a different type. For instance,
if a MAC VACL is configured on a VLAN and then an IPv6 VACL is configured on the same VLAN,
the IPv6 VACL is applied and the MAC VACL is removed.

(cid:129) A MAC ACL is applied only on non-IP packets. Even if there is a match eth type = ipv4 statement
in the MAC ACL, it does not match an IP packet. To avoid this situation, use IP ACLs to apply access
control to the IP traffic instead of using a MAC ACL that matches the EtherType to IPv4 or IPv6.

(cid:129) Multiple boot kickstart statements in the configuration are not supported.

(cid:129)

If you remove an expansion module with Fibre Channel ports, and the cable is still attached, the
following FCP_ERRFCP_PORT errors are displayed:

2008 May 14 15:55:43 switch %KERN-3-SYSTEM_MSG: FCP_ERRFCP_PORT:
gat_fcp_isr_ip_fcmac_sync_intr@424, jiffies = 0x7add9a:Unknown intr src_id 42 - kernel
2008 May 14 15:55:43 switch %KERN-3-SYSTEM_MSG: FCP_ERRFCP_PORT:
gat_fcp_isr_ip_fcmac_sync_intr@424, jiffies = 0x7add9a:Unknown intr src_id 41 - kernel

These messages are informational only, and result in no loss of functionality.

(cid:129)

If you configure Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) on a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, we do not
recommend that you partition the network into a large number of regions.

(cid:129) A downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) to any 5.0(3)N1(x) image can cause the Cisco

Nexus 5000 Series switch to fail. For details, see CSCty92945.

Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Release Notes, Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1a) and Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1)
OL-25823-02

17

Limitations

(cid:129)

If you upgrade a vPC Peer switch from Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1) to Cisco NX-OS
Release5.1(3)N1(1) and feature-set fabricpath is enabled on the upgraded switch, the vPC Peer-Link
enters STP Bridge Assurance Inconsistency which affects all VLANs except VLAN 1 and affects
traffic forwarding for vPC ports.

To avoid this issue, upgrade the peer switch that is running Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1)
switch also to Cisco NX-OS Release 5.1(3)N1(1) or higher and then enable feature-set fabricpath
on the switch or switches. If you accidentally enable feature-set fabricpath in Cisco NX-OS Release
5.1(3)N1(1) when the peer vPC switch is running Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1), disable the
feature-set fabricpath and the vPC will resume STP forwarding state for all VLANs.

(cid:129) By design, vEth interfaces do not share the underlying behavior of a vPC port. As a result, a VLAN
does not get suspended when the peer switch suspends it. For example, when you shut a VLAN on
a primary switch, the VLAN continues to be up on the secondary switch when the vEth interface is
on a FEX. When the VLAN on the primary switch goes down, the VLAN on the vEth interface on
the primary is suspended, but the vEth on the secondary switch is up as it is an active VLAN on the
secondary switch.

(cid:129) RBACL policy enforcement is performed on VLANs on which CTS enforcement is not configured.
This situation occurs when there is at least one VLAN in the switch where CTS is enforced. On a
VLAN where CTS is not enforced, RBACL policy lookup occurs for ingress packets and the packet
is denied or permitted according to the policies in the system. To work around this issue, make sure
that all VLANs on which SGT tagged packets ingress enforce CTS.

(cid:129) The packet length in the IP GRE header of a packet exiting from the switch is not equal to the MTU
value configured in the ERSPAN source session. This is true for SPAN or ERSPAN. This situation
can occur whenever the MTU value that is configured in an ERSPAN or SPAN session is smaller
than the SPAN packet, such as when the packet is truncated. The IP GRE packet is truncated to a
value that differs by -2 to 10 bytes from the expected MTU.

(cid:129) When you configure a Layer 3 interface as an ERSPAN source, and configure the ERSPAN

termination on a Catalyst 6000 switch or a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch, you cannot terminate
the Layer 3 interface ERSPAN source on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch or the Catalyst 6000
switch. To work around this issue, configure VLAN 1 to 512 on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch
or the Catalyst 6000 switch.

(cid:129) Unknown Unicast packets in FabricPath ports are counted as Multicast packets in interface counters.
This issue occurs when unknown Unicast packets are sent and received with a reserved Multicast
address (that floods to a VLAN) in the outer FabricPath header, and the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series
switch increments the interface counter based on the outer FabricPath header. As a result, multicast
counters are incremented. In the case of a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch, Unicast counters are
incremented as they are based on an inner Ethernet header. There is no workaround for this issue.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

If you configure a speed of 1 G on a base or GEM port and then check for compatibility with a Cisco
NX-OS Release 5.0(2) image, no incompatibility is shown. However, because 1 G was not supported
in the Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(2), an incompatibility should be shown. To work around this issue,
manually remove the 1 G configuration from the ports before downgrading to Cisco NX-OS Release
5.0(2) or an earlier release.

In an emulated switch setup, inband keepalive does not work. The following steps are recommended
for peer keepalive over SVI when a switch is in FabricPath mode:

– Use a dedicated front panel port as a vPC+ keepalive. The port should be in CE mode.

– Use a dedicated VLAN to carry the keepalive interface. The VLAN should be CE VLAN.

– Add the management keyword to the corresponding SVI so that the failure of a Layer 3 module

will not bring down the SVI interface.

OL-25823-02

Limitations

– Enter the dual-active exclude interface-vlan keepalive-vlan command to prevent the SVI from

going down on the secondary when a peer-link goes down.

(cid:129) Fabricpath requires 802.1q tagging of inner Ethernet header of the packet. Native VLAN packets
that are sent by a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch are not tagged. As a result, a Cisco Nexus 5000
Series switch drops packets due to packet parsing errors. To work around this issue, enable vlan
dot1q tag native on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch to force 802.1q tagging of native VLAN
packets.

(cid:129) Cisco Nexus 5548UP and Cisco Nexus 5598UP switches with a fibre-channel connection to HP
Virtual Connect modules experience link destabilization and packet loss when the speed is set to
8GB. To work around this issue, leave the speed set to 4GB. For details, see CSCtx52991.

Configuration Synchronization Limitation

When you remove a switch profile using the no switch-profile name [all-config | local-config]
command, the configuration in the switch profile is not immediately removed from the running
configuration. The following warning message appears:

WARNING: Deleting switch-profile will remove all commands configured under
switch-profile. Are you sure you want to delete all switch-profile commands from the
system ?

Are you sure? (y/n)  [n]

For current information about this issue, refer to CSCtl87260.

Limitations on the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Cisco Nexus 5020

The limitations on the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch are as follows:

(cid:129) Traffic going out the Ethernet SPAN destination is always tagged. The SPAN destination can be in
the access or trunk mode and frames on the SPAN source port can be tagged or untagged. Frames
are always tagged internally as they travel through the system. Information about whether the frame
was originally tagged or untagged, as it appeared in the SPAN source, is not preserved in the SPAN
destination. The spanned traffic exiting the SPAN destination port always has the VLAN tag on it.
The correct VLAN tag is applied on the frame as it goes out the SPAN destination. The only
exception is if frames ingress on a SPAN source port on an invalid VLAN. In this case, vlan 0 is
applied on a spanned frame.

(cid:129) Spanned FCoE frames do not preserve original SMAC and DMAC fields. The Ethernet header gets
modified as the frame is spanned to the destination. The modified header fields are displayed when
monitored on the SPAN destination.

(cid:129) The CoS value in spanned FCoE frames on the Ethernet SPAN destination port does not match with
the CoS value in the SPAN FCoE source frame. The CoS value on the captured SPAN FCoE frame
should be ignored.

(cid:129) The class-fcoe cannot be removed even if Fibre Channel is not enabled on a switch.

(cid:129)

If a port drains traffic at a rate less than 100 Kbps, it is error-disabled in 10 seconds to avoid buffer
exhaustion. However, if the drain rate is larger than 100 Kbps, the port may not be consistently
error-disabled within 10 seconds which exhaust ingress buffers and discard frames. Use the shut
command to disable the slow-draining port.

(cid:129) The multicast storm control functionality in the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series does not distinguish

between IP, non-IP, registered, or unregistered multicast traffic. All multicast traffic is subject to a
single-multicast storm control policer when configured.

Limitations

IGMP Snooping Limitation

On the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch with a Cisco Nexus 2000 Series
Fabric Extender (FEX) installed, unregistered IP multicast packets on one VLAN are forwarded to other
VLANs where IGMP snooping is disabled. We recommend that you do not disable IGMP snooping on
the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch. A static IGMP join can be configured
for devices intended to receive IP multicast traffic but not to send IGMP join requests. This limitation
applies to the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch only.

SPAN Limitations on Fabric Extender Ports

The SPAN limitations on Fabric Extender ports are as follows:

(cid:129) On a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, if the SPAN source is a FEX port, the frames will always be

tagged when leaving the SPAN destination.

(cid:129) On a Cisco Nexus 5010 switch or a Nexus 5020 switch, if the SPAN source is an access port on a

switch port or FEX port, the spanned frames at the SPAN destination will be tagged.

(cid:129) On a Cisco Nexus 5500 Platform switch, if the SPAN source is on an access port on the switch port,

the frames will not be tagged when leaving the SPAN destination.

(cid:129) Ports on a FEX can be configured as a tx-source in one session only.

If two ports on the same FEX are enabled to be tx-source, the ports need to be in the same session.
If you configure a FEX port as a tx-source and another port belonging to the same FEX is already
configured as a tx-source on a different SPAN session, an error is displayed on the CLI.

In the following example, Interface Ethernet100/1/1 on a FEX 100 is already configured as a
tx-source on SPAN session-1:

swor28(config-monitor)# show running-config monitor
      version 4.0(1a)N2(1)
      monitor session 1
          source interface Ethernet100/1/1 tx
          destination interface Ethernet1/37
          no shut

If you add an interface Ethernet100/1/2 as a tx-source to a different SPAN session (session-2) the
the following error is displayed:

swor28(config)# monitor session 2
swor28(config-monitor)# source interface ethernet 100/1/2 tx
ERROR: Eth100/1/2: Ports on a fex can be tx source in one session only
swor28(config-monitor)#

(cid:129) When a FEX port is configured as a tx-source, the multicast traffic on all VLANs for which the

tx-source port is a member, is spanned. The FEX port sends out only multicast packets that are not
filtered by IGMP snooping. For example, if FEX ports 100/1/1-12 are configured on VLAN 11 and
the switch port 1/5 sends multicast traffic on VLAN 11 in a multicast group, and hosts connected to
FEX ports 100/1/3-12 are interested in receiving that multicast traffic (through IGMP), then that
multicast traffic goes out on FEX ports 100/1/3-12, but not on 100/1/1-2.

If you configure SPAN Tx on port 100/1/1, although the multicast traffic does not egress out of port
100/1/1, the SPAN destination does receive that multicast traffic, which is due to a design limitation.

(cid:129) When a FEX port is configured as both SPAN rx-source and tx-source, the broadcast, non-IGMP

Layer-2 multicast, and unknown unicast frames originating from that port may be seen twice on the
SPAN destination, once on the ingress and once on the egress path. On the egress path, the frames

OL-25823-02

Caveats

are filtered by the FEX to prevent them from going out on the same port on which they were
received. For example, if FEX port 100/1/1 is configured on VLAN 11 and is also configured as
SPAN rx-source and tx-source and a broadcast frame is received on that port, the SPAN destination
recognizes two copies of the frame, even though the frame is not sent back on port 100/1/1.

(cid:129) A FEX port cannot be configured as a SPAN destination. Only a switch port can be configured and

used as a SPAN destination.

Checkpoint and Configuration Rollback Limitation

When FCoE is enabled, the checkpoint and configuration rollback functionality is disabled.

Layer 3 Limitations

Asymmetric Configuration

In a vPC topology, two Cisco Nexus 5000 switches configured as vPC peer switches need to be
configured symmetrically for Layer 3 configurations such as SVIs, Peer Gateway, routing protocol and
policies, and RACLs.

Note

vPC consistency check does not include Layer 3 parameters.

SVI

When a Layer 3 module goes offline, all SVIs are shutdown.

Upgrading and Downgrading

When a Layer 3 license is installed, the Cisco Nexus 5500 platform does not support an ISSU. Layer 3
module hot swaps are not supported.

Cisco Nexus 5548P Daughter Card (N55-D160L3)

Before installing a Layer 3 daughter card (N55-D160L3) into a Cisco Nexus 5548P switch, you must
upgrade to Cisco NX-OS Release NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N1(1c) or a later release, and then install the
card into the chassis.
