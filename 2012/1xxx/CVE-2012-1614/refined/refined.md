Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-1614:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the application's failure to properly handle user-supplied input, leading to path disclosures. Specifically, certain scripts expose server paths when provided with unexpected input via GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The following path disclosure vulnerabilities are present:

1.  **`visiblehookpoints` plugin `index.php`**: When accessed directly, this script attempts to include a file using a relative path, leading to a PHP error that reveals the full server path.
2.  **`thumbnails.php` GET parameters `page` and `cat`**: Passing array inputs to these parameters leads to a "Fatal error: Unsupported operand types," disclosing parts of the server path.
3.  **`usermgr.php` GET parameter `page`**: Similar to `thumbnails.php`, an array input to the `page` parameter causes a PHP error, leaking the server path.
4.  **`search.inc.php` GET parameters `newer_than` and `older_than`**: Providing array inputs to these parameters results in a "Fatal error: Unsupported operand types," again disclosing parts of the server path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of these path disclosure vulnerabilities is primarily information leakage. An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to gain knowledge of the server's filesystem structure, which could be valuable in planning further attacks, though they are not exploitable for direct code execution or data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors for these vulnerabilities are through user-submitted GET parameters:

*   Accessing `index.php` of the `visiblehookpoints` plugin directly.
*   Manipulating `page` and `cat` parameters in `thumbnails.php`.
*   Manipulating the `page` parameter in `usermgr.php`.
*   Manipulating `newer_than` and `older_than` parameters in `search.inc.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the path disclosure vulnerabilities, with the exception of `usermgr.php`, which requires admin privileges. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the Coppermine gallery.
