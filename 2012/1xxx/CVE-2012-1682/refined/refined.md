Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2012-1682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `ClassFinder` implementation within the `java.beans` component of OpenJDK did not properly perform permission checks. This allowed untrusted code to access classes from restricted packages, effectively bypassing the Java sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of class access permissions in the `ClassFinder` component.
*  **Sandbox Bypass:** This vulnerability could allow attackers to bypass the Java sandbox environment which is designed to isolate applets and applications from the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Java Virtual Machine.
* **System Compromise:** By bypassing the sandbox, attackers could potentially gain control of the system, read or modify data, and perform actions as if they were a user with elevated privileges.
* **Security Bypass:** The vulnerability allows attackers to circumvent the security measures enforced by Java's sandbox mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **Untrusted Java Code:** The primary attack vector is via untrusted Java applets or applications. This means the attacker can deliver the exploit through a malicious website that the user visits or a malicious application that the user installs and runs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without requiring prior authentication on the system.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Java Code:** Attackers must be able to serve malicious Java code via a website or application.
*   **Target System with Java:** The target system must be running a vulnerable version of Java.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

*   **Exploitation:** The vulnerability is one of the issues exploited by the Java 7 0-day exploit published in August 2012. This indicates that the vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
*   **Affected Systems:** The issue impacts a wide array of products including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, various openSUSE versions, and different Ubuntu versions, showing the broad reach of the vulnerability.
*   **Fixes:** The fix involves updating affected java packages, which is typically accomplished through updates from the respective distributions and vendors.
*  **Upstream Fix**: The vulnerability was addressed in OpenJDK and IcedTea.
*  **Multiple Exploits**: CVE-2012-1682 was one of the multiple vulnerabilities exploited in a publicly available exploit for Java 7.
* **CVSS Score**: The vulnerability had a CVSS score of 10.0, which indicates it was critical severity.
*  **Mitigation** Technology can be implemented to reduce the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability by reducing the severity of the flaws.

In summary, CVE-2012-1682 was a critical vulnerability due to the complete breakdown of the Java sandbox security model and it being readily exploited through remote means, leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected systems.
