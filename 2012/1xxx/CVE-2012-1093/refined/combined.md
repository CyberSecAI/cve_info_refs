... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Subject: init script x11-common creates directories in insecure manners
Date: Tue, 28 Feb 2012 18:31:02 +0100
```
Package: x11-common
Version: 1:7.5+8
Tags: security

The init script "x11-common" creates directories "/tmp/.X11-unix" and
"/tmp/.ICE-unix" in insecure manners.

  $ cat -n /etc/init.d/x11-common
    [...]
    33    if [ -e $SOCKET_DIR ] && [ ! -d $SOCKET_DIR ]; then
    34      mv $SOCKET_DIR $SOCKET_DIR.$$
    35    fi
    36    mkdir -p $SOCKET_DIR
    37    chown root:root $SOCKET_DIR
    38    chmod 1777 $SOCKET_DIR
    [...]
    47    if [ -e $ICE_DIR ] && [ ! -d $ICE_DIR ]; then
    48      mv $ICE_DIR $ICE_DIR.$$
    49    fi
    50    mkdir -p $ICE_DIR
    51    chown root:root $ICE_DIR
    52    chmod 1777 $ICE_DIR

If a local user is able to place a symlink before the service starts
(for example before the package installation process), he could gain
root privileges.

For example, the symlink would point to an arbitrary directory (/etc),
so it won't match the conditions (lines 33 and 47) and the arbitrary
directory will get its permissions changed (lines 38 and 52).

As a solution, I would suggest to take care of the "mkdir" return codes
(line 36 and 50).  To do not change permissions on failures.

Thanks.

This script is set -e AFAICT, which means it already does care about the
mkdir return code.

Yes but with the "-p" option, mkdir always return 0 (success):

  $ mkdir /tmp/dir
  $ mkdir /tmp/dir
  mkdir: cannot create directory `/tmp/dir': File exists
  $ echo $?
  1
  $ mkdir -p /tmp/dir
  $ echo $?
  0

I have a working PoC if needed.

And as a solution, I suggested to check the return code of "mkdir" (ran
without -p).

Right, makes sense.  I can drop the -p, I guess.  Not sure what impact
that would have on things assuming they can use /tmp/.X11-unix (I
wouldn't really like to fix this just to have the same issue elsewhere).
Looking at trans_mkdir
(<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxtrans/tree/Xtransutil.c#n480>)
it *looks* like it should be safe, though.

Cheers,
Julien

Removing "-p" sounds good to me.

Actually it's not going to work.  If /tmp/.X11-unix exists and is a
directory (not a symlink), that's good enough for us, we don't want to
fail in that case.

This appears to be a pretty serious problem.  I agree, just dropping
'-p' won't work for functional reasons.

As a better long-term solution, have you considered just moving those
directories out of /tmp?  There's almost always a safer place to put
temporary files/directories.  For instance, under /var/lib or
/var/run, or whatever is most appropriate as an application-specific
directory, whose parent isn't world-writable.

And while I'm at it I'd also like to fix the $SOCKET_DIR.$$ thing
to use a random name instead (probably with mktemp).

Those are for sockets whose name is part of the interface to access
them. So you cannot move them. And the directory itself needs to be
world-writeable, so it is best placed within /tmp.

Hmm, sounds like a badly-designed interface.  Where is this interface
defined?

I don't doubt you, I'm merely naive about X design/interface, and
curious as to how flexible this is.  Is this use of /tmp a Debian
thing, an Xorg thing, or an X11R6 thing?

thanks,

As far as the short-term solution to this problem goes, how about
this (untested)?

if [ -e $SOCKET_DIR ] && [ ! -d $SOCKET_DIR ]; then
    mv $SOCKET_DIR $SOCKET_DIR.$$ || exit $?
fi
if [ ! -e $SOCKET_DIR ]; then
    mkdir $SOCKET_DIR || exit $?
    chown root:root $SOCKET_DIR
    chmod 1777 $SOCKET_DIR
fi

First move other types of files out of the way, as before (is this
even necessary?).  After that, we should have either no SOCKET_DIR or
a directory by that name we have created previously.  If it doesn't
exist as a directory, create it.

If something by that name suddenly appears in the race after our
second existence test, then fail, since someone is clearly doing some
hanky-panky. Otherwise, we should own the file and there shouldn't be
a risk.  I realize that the "|| exit $?" items are redundant given the
script's "set -e", but I like to see things explicit when security
matters, since some future maintainer might accidentally remove the
"set -e" for seemingly unrelated reasons.

Note that the "chown root:root $SOCKET_DIR" also seems redundant to me
(if we didn't already own it, we would have bigger problems, right?).

Compared to your version it allows moving aside a broken symlink, but
other than that (and the mktemp use) they should be equivalent, I think.
Another pair of eyes would be appreciated though...

I guess it protects against some user doing mkdir /tmp/.X11-unix before
this runs (which probably means before the package is installed, so it's
not like this is a very likely race) and then owning the directory.

I think there is still a race in your version in the lines which look
like:

> +  mkdir $ICE_DIR 2>/dev/null || [ -d $ICE_DIR ] && ! [ -h $ICE_DIR ]

mkdir will fail if the file already exists for any reason.  After
mkdir fails, it is possible that another process will be able to run
and remove/create new versions of the path with different properties
after your tests run.

Here's a specific attack that could work, I think:

1. create a plain file named $ICE_DIR
2. monitor the file and wait for it to be moved to the new mktemp name
3. create a directory with the $ICE_DIR name before mkdir runs
4. mkdir will fail
5. After the -h test finishes, but before the chown is run, remove the
directory and replace it with a symlink

Yes, this is complicated and would require lots of luck given the
context of the script, but it would certainly be best to avoid any
dangerous races.

The reason that my version of the script avoids this issue is that it
relies on the atomicity of mkdir.  If that fails, simply bail out.
Don't do any additional tests afterward, since that introduces a race.
I can't guarantee my version doesn't have other races though, so
please do pick over it carefully...

Oh, right, duh.  Well, the dir is created every time the box boots,
since /tmp is cleared, so it is needed for sure.

/etc/init.d/x11-common on boot should run before any unprivileged user
has a chance to do anything (it's in rcS.d, and depends only on
$local_fs), so it's less of a problem than initial package installation
AFAICT.

I'm not that familiar with the newer dependency boot sequencing, but I
know someone who looked into this and seemed to think cron or atd
*could* run before it.  Looking at the scripts I have on my box, it
seems like you may be right, assuming nothing else has a similar set
of dependencies (namely, only $local_fs) which could hand off control
to a user non-root user.  However, my analysis doesn't cover every
init script in every possible package...

I think the obsolete chown command should be removed (as said Tim), and
also the chmod should by replaced by a single atomic operation (using
"mkdir -m").  Those two things will avoid usages of dangerous commands
and then, reduce TOCTTOU risks.

So if chown is removed, another check has to be introduced.  It is to
check if the directory isn't owned by root.  Because a user could try to
own X sockets by creating the directory himself.

Well, here is how I would see the script (with a lot of comments to try
making things clear):

  # We move $SOCKET_DIR if:
  #   - it exists but is not a dir
  #   - is whatever but not owned by root
  #   - is a symlink
  if { [ -e $SOCKET_DIR ] && [ ! -d $SOCKET_DIR ]; } ||
     { [ -e $SOCKET_DIR ] && [ ! -O $SOCKET_DIR ]; } ||
       [ -h $SOCKET_DIR ]; then

    mv $SOCKET_DIR $SOCKET_DIR.$$
  fi

  # At this point, we could find:
  #  - Correct directory (ie. $SOCKET_DIR owned by root)
  #  - a symlink or whatever (raced by a malicious user)
  #
  # So before creating it, we need to check if:
  #  - does not exist or is not owned by root
  if [ ! -O $SOCKET_DIR ];
    # symlink, malicious files will give a failure here
    mkdir -m 1777 $SOCKET_DIR
  fi

What do you think about this?

To finish, I find the ways to create those two directories ($SOCKET_DIR
and $ICE_DIR) quite redundant.  A function called create_dir() could
contain the code above and be launched from both set_up_socket_dir() and
set_up_ice_dir()?

I'm not convinced the chown can be removed.  And 'mkdir -m 1777 foo' is
not any more atomic than 'mkdir foo && chmod 1777 foo'.  The problem is
that I'd still like to be able to chown and chmod /tmp/.X11-unix if it
already exists as a directory when the script runs.  I can do that in C
with something like this:

  ret = mkdir("/tmp/.X11-unix", 0700);
  if (ret == 0 || errno == EEXIST) {
    fd = open("/tmp/.X11-unix", O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW);
    if (fd < 0)
      fail();
    fstat(fd, &st);
    if (!S_ISDIR(st.st_mode))
      fail();
    if (fchown(fd, 0, 0)) fail();
    if (fchmod(fd, 01777)) fail();
  } else {
    fail();
  }

but so far I haven't seen a way to do that in shell, because chmod(1)
doesn't have a --no-dereference option, and even if it did it doesn't
look like I could safely detect whether to exit with failure or success.

hmm, how about this:

mkdir -p /tmp/.X11-unix
chown -h root:root /tmp/.X11-unix
stat=$(LC_ALL=C stat -c '%u %g %F' /tmp/.X11-unix)
if [ "$stat" != '0 0 directory' ]; then
  exit 1
fi
chmod 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix

?

Agreed.  Or drop those two functions and call set_up_dir "$SOCKET_DIR &&
set_up_dir $ICE_DIR" directly.

Thanks a lot to you both for the help so far...

How about the following:

# create a directory in /tmp.

create_dir() {
  error=0

    if [ $error -ne 0 ] ; then

           chown -h root:root "/tmp/$1" || error=1

If mkdir -p fails (it for example does if .X11-unix is a proper file
or a dangling symlink), one might refrain from issuing the following
commands.

Are there any kernel hardening patches that check ownership of symlinks?
If there are then changing the ownership of a /tmp/.X11-unix symlink
might actually introduce a problem similar to the one this was
originally trying to solve in those cases.

And I think if there is something else, it might make sense to
try to move it away again and try to create it again.

The command "mkdir -m" calls the mkdir() syscall, and its second
argument seems to be the mode.

  $ man 2 mkdir
  [...]
  int mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

Maybe I'm wrong, but this is what I call an atomic way to create and set
permissions (ie. two operations in a unique syscall).  For example:

  $ strace mkdir -m 222 /tmp/foo
  [...]
  mkdir("/tmp/foo", 0222)                 = 0

Yes, fchown & fchmod use file descriptors, those functions are safer
than commands chmod & chown that directly use filenames...  This is why
I consider those commands dangerous.

This would work (even if it uses chmod), but wasn't the Bash approach (test
with "-O", "-G" and "-d") simpler than using "stat"?

Agreed. :)

the second argument to mkdir obeys umask, so you end up doing

mkdir()
open()
fstat()
fchmod()

as far as I can tell.

test -d follows symlinks...

the problem with stat(1) is it's on /usr so I'd have to make this script
depend on $remote_fs.  Which shouldn't be a problem, but is still a bit
annoying.

Julien

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
