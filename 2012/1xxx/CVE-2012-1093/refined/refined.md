Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure method of creating directories within the `x11-common` init script in Debian-based systems. Specifically, the script creates `/tmp/.X11-unix` and `/tmp/.ICE-unix` directories with `mkdir -p`, which doesn't return an error if the directory already exists (even if it's a symlink). Subsequently, the script proceeds to change the permissions using `chmod`, potentially affecting a symlinked target.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink vulnerability:** The script blindly creates directories in `/tmp` without proper checks, leading to symlink attacks where a malicious local user can create a symlink to a critical directory (e.g., `/etc`) before the init script is executed.
*   **Insecure directory creation:** The usage of `mkdir -p` combined with `chmod` makes the script vulnerable, as it bypasses the intended check for directory existence. `mkdir -p` does not return an error if a file or symlink exists in the path, but does not create a directory.
*  **Race Condition:** A race condition exists after `mkdir` fails, as it is possible to remove or create new versions of the target paths after existence checks but before the permissions are updated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful symlink attack allows a local user to change permissions on arbitrary directories and gain root privileges. This can lead to a full system compromise if sensitive system files are targeted.
*   **Integrity Impact:** Malicious users could alter crucial system files, thereby affecting system integrity and functionality.
*   **Availability Impact:** The attacker could potentially modify system files to cause denial of service, thereby impacting the system's availability.
*  **Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker could potentially modify files to disclose information or configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is limited to local users who can manipulate the `/tmp` directory, especially during package installation or system startup.
*  **Pre-execution Symlink Creation**: The attacker must create the symlink before the init script runs, either during package installation or before a service restart.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker requires local user access to the system.
*   **Write Access to /tmp:**  The attacker must have the ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to place the symlink before the vulnerable init script is executed. This is especially pertinent to package installation processes or during system startup.

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Debian `x11-common` package and its init script.
*   The fix involves a more secure directory creation process that avoids using `mkdir -p` and instead relies on a sequence of checks that use `mktemp` to avoid creating files and correctly verify the type of file using `-d` before attempting permission changes. Additionally, the fix addresses the race condition by performing the directory creation and ownership/permission updates in a single atomic step if possible.
*   The vulnerability was publicly discussed on the `oss-security` mailing list.

**Mitigation:**
* The issue was fixed in `xorg` version `1:7.6+12`
