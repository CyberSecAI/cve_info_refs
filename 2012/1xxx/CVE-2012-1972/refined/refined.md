  "CVE-2012-1972": {
    "description": "Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n\nThe root cause was a heap-use-after-free in `nsHTMLEditor::CollapseAdjacentTextNodes`. The vulnerability occurs because `CollapseAdjacentTextNodes` stores non-refcounted `nsIDOMNode*` in a local `textNodes` array. When one of these nodes is deleted and a function like GetPreviousSibling is called, a crash occurs.  The crash can also occur on the esr10 branch.\n\nUse-after-free vulnerabilities allow for remote code execution if exploited correctly.\n\nA specially crafted HTML page can trigger a use-after-free condition leading to denial of service via application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "impact": "Denial of service via application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted web page or through other means (like viewing a full remote RSS feed).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to create and host a specially crafted web page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
        "root_cause": "The code stores raw pointers to DOM nodes without proper reference counting. This leads to use-after-free conditions when these nodes are deallocated but still referenced.",
       "additional_details": "The fix involves storing `nsCOMPtr` smart pointers instead of raw pointers in the affected code segments (`nsTArray` changed to `nsTArray<nsCOMPtr>`). This ensures proper reference counting and prevents use-after-free."
