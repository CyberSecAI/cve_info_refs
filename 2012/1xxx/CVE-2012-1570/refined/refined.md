Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an error in MaraDNS's cache update policy. This policy doesn't properly handle revoked domain names. Specifically, when a domain name is deleted from the registration, MaraDNS doesn't correctly remove it from its cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Cache Handling:** The core issue is that MaraDNS fails to invalidate or remove cached DNS records when a domain name is revoked or deleted.
*   **DNS Spoofing:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to keep a domain name resolvable even after it has been officially deleted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DNS Spoofing:** A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to maintain control over a domain name's resolution, even after the domain has been deleted from the registry. This allows the attacker to potentially redirect traffic intended for the legitimate domain to a malicious server they control.
*   **Information Control:** By controlling the DNS resolution, the attacker could potentially intercept sensitive information or redirect users to phishing sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely. The attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Cache Manipulation:** The attack focuses on manipulating the DNS cache of MaraDNS by exploiting the flawed update policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to a vulnerable MaraDNS server and needs to be able to get the server to cache the spoofed entries before the domain is deleted.
*   **Knowledge of DNS:** An understanding of how DNS caching works is required for the attacker to craft the necessary malicious queries.
* **Timing:** The attacker needs to make sure that the rogue DNS entry is cached by MaraDNS before the legitimate DNS entry is deleted from the registry.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of MaraDNS prior to 1.3.0.7.15 and 1.4.12.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the server manages cached entries for deleted domain names.
*   The fix involves ensuring that cached DNS records are correctly removed when the corresponding domain name is deleted.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla entry 804770 and related tracking bugs (804776, 804777) highlight that this issue is a caching problem where deleted domain names are not removed from the cache and remain resolvable.
