  "cve": "CVE-2012-1853",
  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows networking components handle specially crafted RAP responses. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
  "affected_systems": [
    "Windows XP",
    "Windows Server 2003",
    "Windows Vista",
    "Windows Server 2008",
    "Windows 7",
    "Windows Server 2008 R2"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows networking components fail to properly handle a Remote Administration Protocol (RAP) response.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges on the target system, leading to complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a sequence of specially crafted RAP packets to the target system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system.",
      "component": "The affected component is browser.dll"
  },
  "mitigations": [
      "Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems connected directly to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.",
    "Disable the LanmanWorkstation service."
  ],
   "workarounds": [
    "Disable the LanmanWorkstation service by modifying the registry and stopping the service"
  ],
  "remediation": "Apply the security updates provided by Microsoft."
