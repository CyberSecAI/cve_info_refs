Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-1096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of file paths by NetworkManager and `wpa_supplicant` when handling x509v3 certificates and private key files. NetworkManager (versions 0.9 and earlier) stores the file paths to certificates and keys, and then `wpa_supplicant` (which is configured by NetworkManager) access these files as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A local user, with the ability to add new network connections, can specify arbitrary file paths for certificates and private keys. This allows `wpa_supplicant` (running as root) to read the contents of these files.  The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation issue, where a user may read arbitrary system files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read the contents of other users' private keys and certificates, or any other system file, gaining access to sensitive information. This is a direct information disclosure vulnerability.
*   **Use of other users' certificates:** A local user could also potentially use other users' certificates and private keys when making a connection.
*   **Feeding garbage to wpa_supplicant:** An attacker could also feed arbitrary data to wpa_supplicant.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
*   **Manipulating Connection Settings:** The attacker must be able to add or modify network connection profiles, usually done through a network configuration tool that uses NetworkManager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to create new network connections or modify existing ones.
*   **No Special Privileges (Initially):** The attacker doesn't initially need root privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported to affect NetworkManager versions 0.9 and earlier, and also 0.6.
*   The recommended fix involves NetworkManager directly streaming certificate/key data to `wpa_supplicant`, rather than passing file paths. This was already done in NM 0.7 for system connections (but was not implemented correctly), but this approach was not taken for user connections (i.e., user-provided files).
*   The issue is considered a design flaw rather than a bug in some distributions.
*   Some distributions have mitigated this risk by requiring admin authentication when creating new network connections. However, the root issue is not resolved via this method.
*   The vulnerability is present in a number of products, including multiple versions of SUSE, Ubuntu and Red Hat.
*   There is an upstream bug report (in GNOME bugzilla) that confirms this issue is still present (as of 2018) in the NetworkManager code and that it is difficult to fix cleanly, with mitigations only being suggested (not a full fix).
*   Some distros marked this issue as "won't fix" which highlights the lack of an easy resolution for this issue.
*   A Red Hat bug report shows the issue was closed as "WONTFIX" with the understanding that the issue was to be resolved upstream in a future release.
