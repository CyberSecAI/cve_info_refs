# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=793329#c0)  Matthias Gerstner    2018-02-09 10:39:22 UTC  ``` We have come across an old security issue regarding NetworkManager that doesn't seem to be handled yet. I don't know whether you ever got aware of this issue. There seems to be no prior bug about it in your bugzilla.  Details can be found in our openSUSE bug:  <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=738073>  Basically it seems to be possible to add new connections as a local user (e.g. 802.1x authenticated ones) and specify arbitrary certificate and private key locations. This could e.g. be used to specify other users' certificates or private keys.  I had a look at the current NetworkManager code and it looks like the issue is still present. The situation seems difficult to fix cleanly but maybe at least some mitigation could be built in? ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=793329#c1)  Thomas Haller    2018-02-09 20:48:39 UTC  ``` Files have also other downsides, like NetworkManager (as root) or supplicant/VPN plugin (usually root too) might not be able to access the files of the user. For example due to SELinux, or the files could be on a fuse filesystem which isn't readable even to root.   The long term fix is not to use files at all, but pkcs11 URLs. That requires improvements and support from various components, and some work is already completed in this regard and it should already work today.  However, the day when files will be entirely rejected seems far away still.   As a mitigation, don't allow such untrusted users to create connections for NetworkManager. That can be controlled via PolicyKit. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=793329#c2)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2020-11-12 14:29:55 UTC  ``` bugzilla.gnome.org is being shut down in favor of a GitLab instance.  We are closing all old bug reports and feature requests in GNOME Bugzilla which have not seen updates for a long time.  If you still use NetworkManager and if you still see this bug / want this feature in a recent and supported version of NetworkManager, then please feel free to report it at <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/-/issues/>  Thank you for creating this report and we are sorry it could not be implemented (workforce and time is unfortunately limited). ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=793329#c0)  Matthias Gerstner    2018-02-09 10:39:22 UTC  ``` We have come across an old security issue regarding NetworkManager that doesn't seem to be handled yet. I don't know whether you ever got aware of this issue. There seems to be no prior bug about it in your bugzilla.  Details can be found in our openSUSE bug:  <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=738073>  Basically it seems to be possible to add new connections as a local user (e.g. 802.1x authenticated ones) and specify arbitrary certificate and private key locations. This could e.g. be used to specify other users' certificates or private keys.  I had a look at the current NetworkManager code and it looks like the issue is still present. The situation seems difficult to fix cleanly but maybe at least some mitigation could be built in? ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=793329#c1)  Thomas Haller    2018-02-09 20:48:39 UTC  ``` Files have also other downsides, like NetworkManager (as root) or supplicant/VPN plugin (usually root too) might not be able to access the files of the user. For example due to SELinux, or the files could be on a fuse filesystem which isn't readable even to root.   The long term fix is not to use files at all, but pkcs11 URLs. That requires improvements and support from various components, and some work is already completed in this regard and it should already work today.  However, the day when files will be entirely rejected seems far away still.   As a mitigation, don't allow such untrusted users to create connections for NetworkManager. That can be controlled via PolicyKit. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=793329#c2)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2020-11-12 14:29:55 UTC  ``` bugzilla.gnome.org is being shut down in favor of a GitLab instance.  We are closing all old bug reports and feature requests in GNOME Bugzilla which have not seen updates for a long time.  If you still use NetworkManager and if you still see this bug / want this feature in a recent and supported version of NetworkManager, then please feel free to report it at <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/-/issues/>  Thank you for creating this report and we are sorry it could not be implemented (workforce and time is unfortunately limited). ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-04-06 03:56:11 UTC  ``` From the Red Hat bug at $URL:  A security flaw was found in the way NetworkManager, a network connections manager, and wpa_supplicant, a WPA/WPA2/IEEE 802.1X supplicant, performed system file paths sanitization for x509v3 certificate and private key files, used for connection to trusted networks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c0)  Ludwig Nussel   2011-12-21 14:06:56 UTC  ``` Connections in NetworkManager 0.9 store path names to certificates and key files. That means NM and wpa_supplicant access the user's files as root. A user who is allowed to add connections (default for locally logged in users) may specify arbitrary file names. NM happily accepts files of any user, even device files. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2011-12-21 23:00:12 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c2)  Gary Ching-Pang Lin   2011-12-23 08:33:27 UTC  ``` In fact ,NM prior to 0.9 also allowed arbitrary certificate file names. NM verifies[*] the certificate first and then passes it to wpa_supplicant. So, I think all we have to do is to make sure the verification function is secure.  [*] See nm_setting_802_1x_set_ca_cert(), nm_setting_802_1x_set_client_cert(), nm_setting_802_1x_set_phase2_ca_cert(), nm_setting_802_1x_set_phase2_client_cert(), nm_setting_802_1x_set_private_key(), and nm_setting_802_1x_set_phase2_private_key() in libnm-util/nm-setting-8021x.c ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c3)  Ludwig Nussel   2011-12-23 08:41:29 UTC  ``` The only sane fix would be to change the design and not pass file names at all to the daemon. A program that runs as root and accesses files of a user is always asking for trouble. So the better way to handle this is to pass the certificate data directly via dbus to the daemon. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c4)  Ludwig Nussel   2012-01-17 15:15:33 UTC  ``` Also affects 0.6 ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c5)  Ludwig Nussel   2012-01-17 15:25:15 UTC  ``` Do we know the calling user's id? If so we could introduce a small helper program that switches to the calling user's id, opens the file and prints it to stdout. NM can then write the data received to a safe, root only accessible place. From there on NM and wpa_supplicant only need to refer to the safe file. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c6)  Gary Ching-Pang Lin   2012-02-03 09:13:21 UTC  ``` NM will try to query the user's id when activating the connection (nm-manager.c: nm_manager_activate_connection()). Maybe we can do some trick in the function to validate the given certificate file. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c7)  Ludwig Nussel   2012-03-02 08:46:35 UTC  ``` CVE-2012-1096 ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c10)  Tomáš Chvátal   2017-08-12 15:42:19 UTC  ``` Move to TW target. Reassign to NM maintainer. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c11)  Salvatore Bonaccorso   2017-11-11 21:04:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomáš Chvátal from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c10)) > Move to TW target. Reassign to NM maintainer.  Has this issue been fixed upstream? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c12)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-02-07 13:19:22 UTC  ``` For reference, here is the original oss-sec posting for this issue:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/02/29/2>  And this is the reproducer program Ludwig provided back then:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/02/29/2/1>  I have looked at this issue and it seems still to be contained in the upstream code. I failed to completely reproduce it due to me not having a suitable test machine with a wireless interface available. Also getting through the layers of D-Bus and polkit is not too easy.  To clarify things a bit: At times it sounded to me that this vulnerability would allow a local regular user to read arbitrary file contents from root restricted files. This is not the case as far as I can tell, because network manager does not offer an interface to read out the content of the files pointed to by the paths in question.  But it *is* possible to place arbitrary paths into the wpa supplicant configuration. It would probably be possible to use another user's private key or certificate file in a WPA based connection even if there would otherwise be no read access for it. Also it allows to feed arbitrary garbage to wpa_supplicant.  What is stated in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c2) is only partially correct I think. As far as I can see only the client side code verifies the content of certificate files. But using the D-Bus interface directly it looks like it is still possible to circumvent these checks. Also even if there would be daemon side checks: The file content could change at a later time without the daemon noticing.  To fix this completely an approach like Ludwig outlined in [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c3) seems to be the best option. This would require substantial changes. Instead of directly passing the certificate and private key paths through to wpa supplicant, network manager would need to read the certificate data directly via D-Bus. This data would then need to be stored in defined locations that are only accessible to root. The path to this safe location would then need to be written into the wpa supplicant configuration.  This change would also make displaying the configuration difficult, because the original certificate paths would be lost. Only the data would still be available. So the certificate contents would need to be displayed to the user instead. Or these files would need to carry a rememberable identifier that the user gets to choose.  So this requires a medium sized design change. That is probably also the reason that nobody bothered to fix this yet.  A mitigation that does not require the design change might be to try and limit the acceptable certificate and key file paths to "safe ones". But this kind of logic is typically fragile and hard to get right.  I don't think there is anything we can do about this ourselves, except maybe trying to devise a mitigation steam. The clean fix would require discussion with upstream and would also be difficult to backport into existing versions of NetworkManager. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c13)  Karol Babioch   2018-02-09 10:42:38 UTC  ``` Matthias opened a bug upstream to (hopefully) get some attentions to this:   <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=793329> ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=738073#c15)  Jonathan Kang   2023-05-26 08:38:56 UTC  ``` Currently in Tumbleweed, admin authentication is asked when creating a new network connection. This kind of works around the issue.  In terms of fixing this issue, there is no clear date of when this will be fixed as described here[1].  *[1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=793329#c1> ``` |  |
