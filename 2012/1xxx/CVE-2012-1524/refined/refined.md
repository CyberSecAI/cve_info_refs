Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2012-1524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted. This improper handling of deleted objects leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability:  Internet Explorer fails to properly manage memory when accessing a deleted object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user.
- Full System Control: If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted website: An attacker can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can leverage compromised websites, or websites that accept user-generated content, to host the malicious code.
- Embedded ActiveX controls: Attackers can embed malicious ActiveX controls within applications or Microsoft Office documents.
- Social Engineering: Attackers must convince users to visit a malicious website or open a malicious attachment, typically through links in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a website or compromise existing ones.
- Ability to embed malicious content within an application or office document.
- Ability to convince the user to interact with malicious content.

The document provides detailed information about affected software, mitigation strategies (such as Enhanced Security Configuration on servers), workarounds, and detection/deployment guidance. It also confirms that the vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
