## Details

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948),

[CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If

the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [14.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/14.0%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [14.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/14.0%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [14.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/14.0%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [14.0+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/14.0%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Thunderbird. This is a

  known issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be

  fixed in a later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make

all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120423123513
Steps to reproduce:
It is possible to execute JavaScript on the Feed-View - indicating that there might be a security issue leading to RCE. The bug was found as a side-effect while crafting a RSS version of the H5SC.
A PoC file is attached - please see below. The relevant part in the PoC file is this small snippet:
<description><![CDATA[<embed
src="javascript:top.SubscribeHandler.uninit=function(){alert('hello
chrome://')}">]]></description>
Firefox doesn't seem to filter <embed> elements inside the RSS <description> properly - so we can exec JavaScript. This allows us to hook into the pre-existing script tags. Note the alert in the PoC file is not a "classic website alert" but indicates privileged script exec.
The bug was found on Ubuntu 11.10:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:11.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/11.0
I also tested in Win7 with Nightly (15.0.a1 - today's build) - same effect, JavaScript execution in Feed-View.

One note: The PoC might need to be refreshed once to work, I overloaded the "uninit" method - thus the alert will not happen unless you refresh the Feed-View once.
Also, note that the headers might need to be set properly to have it work - I am using application/rss+xml.

Confirmed that <embed> leads to code execution, but so far am not seeing a privilege escalation. You do have access to the SubscribeHandler.\_feedWriter element so there may be some way.
Firefox 3.6.x is fine so this may be related to the new HTML5 parser or the replacement of the old ParanoidSinkFragment. If so some add-ons might be in trouble because they may not be as diligent as the feed handler at running everything in a non-privileged sandbox.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEW

This testcase demonstrates that the testcase doesn't run with privilege, nor does the later uninit() call. For an attacker triggering that is easy -- just cause the page/frame to navigate.

We're supposed to use nsTreeSanitizer, but it looks like it's not being used, since embed is not on its white list and it always sanitizes the src attribute for javascript: URLs.

Normally I would, but not right now. Sorry. I'm semi-absent due to health issues.
Preliminary debugging suggests that the sanitizer is removing the embed element as it should, but since the element has been inserted into the document fragment once and didn't get its src removed, nsHTMLSharedObjectElement::StartObjectLoad stills end up running off a runnable using the src.
Are detached embed elements expected to start loads like detached img elements or is it a bug of that the embed element still attempts to start the load?

Mario, if you can find a proof of concept that shows an escalation of privilege, this would qualify for a bug bounty. As it is, this does not look to be exploitable.

Josh, ping?
So I've been thinking what we might do about this. I've come up with three possible solutions.
1) add a method to all elements for making the element harmless. Make the sanitizer call this method on each element that gets removed.
2) remove all attributes from all elements that the sanitizer removes.
3) move attribute sanitation to the tree op executor.
Option #1 would require changes to the classes that implement elements but would probably perform slightly better than option #2. Option #2 would be the least invasive option. Option #3 would be the safest option but would also be the ugliest in terms of encapsulation and code organization.
bz, any advice?

Option #1 seems like the thing most likely to continue working correctly as new features are added to elements, of the three options. Unless option 2 is talking about a whitelist?

No, option 2 is not about a whitelist. Option 2 is about removing all attributes from all elements that the sanitizer ends up removing from the tree for any reason. The possible reasons for removing an element are: the sanitizer decides to flatten the element itself (the element is removed but its children are retained), the sanitizer decides to prune the element itself (the element and the whole subtree rooted at the element are removed) and the sanitizer decided to prune an ancestor of the element.
I was actually starting to prefer option #2.
Option #3 would be insufficient as long as XML does not go through the tree op executor.

Ah, ok. Option #2 sounds fine, then.

Simply implementing option #2 isn't enough. The embed handling runnable runs off the script runner queue instead of the event loop, so the sanitizer runs to late. To do with this problem, I need to put an update batch around both the parse and the sanitation. This leads to another problem: The code in the sanitizer currently assumes it's not wrapped in an update batch and calls methods that try to notify. It seems that it's necessary to find non-notifying alternatives for such tree mutations. As far as I can tell, the non-notifying alternatives use the old child indices, which is somewhat inconvenient. Also, the parser occasionally intentionally breaks out of the update batch it itself has established. It's not clear to me yet if wrapping the parse in an extra update batch is going to be a problem in the cases where the sanitizer is used (i.e. where the parser isn't appending to a tree that's being rendered at the same time).
bz, are there non-notifying tree mutation methods that don't use the old child indices?

Not at the moment; we're trying to get rid of the non-notifying stuff altogether, iirc...

So the crux of the matter isn't notifying per se but inhibiting script runners from running from the start of the parse to the end of the sanitization. It just seems that establishing an update batch is the most appropriate way to inhibit script runners from running and that mutations that do notify also attempt to fire mutation events and assert if script runners are being inhibited.
What would be the most appropriate way to inhibit script runners from running from the start of the parse to the end of the sanitization and to turn off attempts to fire mutation events during the modifications the sanitizer performs?

I'd say we don't have a good way of preventing any and all scripts for an "extended" period, if "extended" means across multiple asynchronous calls. Script blockers are always stack-based, and I think they need to stay that way since they are a global mechanism and doesn't just block one document.
So if you need something across multiple async calls, we need something else which is per-document.

That's not what it means. I'm looking for a stack-based solution that's in effect for the duration of a synchronous parse and for the duration of a synchronous sanitization both invoked from a parent method on the stack.
Existing update batches successfully deal with script runners. The problem is that in order to remove a node during an update batch without triggering an assertion in the code that tries to fire a mutation event is to use the deprecated index-based methods.
So I'm looking for a solution that has the following three properties:
\* Is not deprecated.
\* Prevents script runners from running.
\* Does not try to fire mutation events while script runners are prevented from running.
If there is no such solution, I guess I should proceed with the deprecated APIs, but it's sad to add more uses of APIs that were trying to get rid of.

I expect there might be privilege escalation in the clipboard case.

One thing worth exploring would be parsing into a document that's set as loadedAsData and then changing the owner of the document fragment before returning it. However, I would still like to have some sort of script runner prevention thing going on that encompasses both the parsing and the sanitization.

Ah, cool, that is much simpler!
The assertion only means that we've suppressed the event, it doesn't actually mean that the event was fired when it was dangerous to do so.
So technically using a scriptblocker/updatebatch fulfills all the requirements you set up. But I think you additionally don't want to assert.
You could simply do that by putting a nsAutoScriptBlockerSuppressNodeRemoved around the code you want to protect.
However, keep in mind that scriptblockers doesn't actually completely block scriptrunners, they just make them execute later. So wouldn't it still be a problem that script would run for any injected <script> elements, it would just run later?

Script elements injected during fragment parsing are marked as already started, so they are prevented from executing even before we get to the sanitizer.
I believe the patch I'm attaching is a sufficient fix. However, to add more defense in depth, we could make the fragment parsing use a separate document that's marked as "loaded as data" and then transfer the ownership of the document fragment to another document after the sanitization. Should I do that?

Potential fix
Requesting review for the solution, because it seems to work and I think we need to land something.
However, I'm not quite happy with this fix. The other cases in nsParserUtils that use the parser to create a DOM that supposed to be inert, a document marked as "loaded as data" is used. To use the same mechanism here, it would be necessary to transfer the ownership of the document fragment to the document of the context node after performing the parsing with the document that's not the final destination document. However, it appears that we don't have reusable code for forcing node adoption across different-origin documents and ideally the dummy document would use a null principal, so I gave up trying to do that.

I think we should make the security rating more severe here to make a fix eligible for ESR inclusion. In the builds without the fix for this bug, if the user copies a run of text on one Web site and the run of text has an indivisible embed element with the JavaScript URL as its src, pasting into contenteditable on a different-origin Web site runs the script in the context of that site.
I verified that both trunk and ESR suffer from this problem. I'm attaching a backport of the fix for ESR.

Confirmed that on current FF versions. I ran the same tests against the copy&paste scenario that I ran against the RSS view; <embed> is the only one executing JavaScript.
For reference sake: I used the string you can get on html5sec.org when executing: Firebug -> vectors() (all vectors - isolated and concatenated)

User impact if declined:
Unauthorized cross-site execution in the context of site that has a contenteditable-based editable area if the user can be convinced into copying some text from a malicious site and pasting it into the editable area. Unauthorized script access between distinct syndication items in a feed. Potentially similar vulnerabilities in Firefox extensions that use the same API as the feed reading features of Firefox.

Has baked on mozilla-central over the weekend.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
No true risk in sight. The first risk that I can think of is that some element implementation might misbehave if it's associated script runner gets deferred for longer than the element implementation expects. However, that risk since low, since the sanitizer is trying to eliminate this sort of things that would usually run off a script runner.

Raising security severity because this affects more than originally thought. The copy/paste case might be more "moderate" than "high" given the required social engineering (but a click-dragging attack might work well), but there's also worry an unknown number of addons might rely on this same sanitization API.Keywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---) → [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [sg:low]

Backport to ESR
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
See [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=750096#c42 "VERIFIED FIXED - JavaScript execution via special HTML in RSS view; XSS when pasting malicious content into contenteditable") and [comment 46](/show_bug.cgi?id=750096#c46 "VERIFIED FIXED - JavaScript execution via special HTML in RSS view; XSS when pasting malicious content into contenteditable").
User impact if declined:
See [comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=750096#c41 "VERIFIED FIXED - JavaScript execution via special HTML in RSS view; XSS when pasting malicious content into contenteditable").
Fix Landed on Version:
Firefox 16; also branch-landed on 15 and 14.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
See [comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=750096#c41 "VERIFIED FIXED - JavaScript execution via special HTML in RSS view; XSS when pasting malicious content into contenteditable").
String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None.
I thought I already requested approval for ESR, but a bug history says otherwise. Anyway, I'm requesting approval for ESR now in the light of [comment 46](/show_bug.cgi?id=750096#c46 "VERIFIED FIXED - JavaScript execution via special HTML in RSS view; XSS when pasting malicious content into contenteditable").
I'll be on vacation returning on July 11, so if the ESR backport patch gets approval before that, please treat it as checkin-needed (just bug number, review and approval in the commit comment).

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
\*
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman,
Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox
13.
\*
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher
Mario Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a
mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop
to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes
the address of the previously site entered to be displayed
in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page.
This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
\*
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya
used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-afte.r-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
o CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased o CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode o
CVE-2012-1953: Out of bounds read in
ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor o CVE-2012-1952: Bad
cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
\*
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward
and history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack through the context menu using a data: URL. In
this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show
only this frame", and "View background image") are
disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL,
allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher
Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed
in the HTML feed-view using tag within the RSS . This
problem is due to tags not being filtered out during
parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class
and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.
\*
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher
Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
\*
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony
Payne reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS,
Mozilla's color management library. With a carefully
crafted color profile portions of a user's memory could be
incorporated into a transformed image and possibly
deciphered.
\*
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer
Frederic Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header
is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication
occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it
occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected
against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.
\*
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher
Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher
Matt McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using
the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
\*
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers
Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla
allows the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL,
it is possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution
attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-47

## Improper filtering of javascript in HTML feed-view

Announced
July 17, 2012
Reporter
Mario Heiderich
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 14
* Firefox ESR 10.0.6
* SeaMonkey 2.11
* Thunderbird 14
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.6

### Description

Security researcher **Mario Heiderich** reported that javascript
could be executed in the HTML feed-view using `<embed>` tag
within the RSS `<description>`. This problem is due to
`<embed>` tags not being filtered out during parsing and can
lead to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a
parser utility class and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.

Original advisory details:

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith,

Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered

memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1948](/security/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1949](/security/CVE-2012-1949))

Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous

site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this

to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1950](/security/CVE-2012-1950))

Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1951](/security/CVE-2012-1951), [CVE-2012-1952](/security/CVE-2012-1952), [CVE-2012-1953](/security/CVE-2012-1953), [CVE-2012-1954](/security/CVE-2012-1954))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site

while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker

could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-1955](/security/CVE-2012-1955))

Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML  tags were not filtered out of the

HTML  of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML

feed view. ([CVE-2012-1957](/security/CVE-2012-1957))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1958](/security/CVE-2012-1958))

Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be

bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1959](/security/CVE-2012-1959))

Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color

management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-1960](/security/CVE-2012-1960))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its

value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct

clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-1961](/security/CVE-2012-1961))

Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1962](/security/CVE-2012-1962))

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to

access a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. ([CVE-2012-1963](/security/CVE-2012-1963))

Matt McCutchen discovered a clickjacking vulnerability in the certificate

warning page. A remote attacker could trick a user into accepting a malicious

certificate via a crafted certificate warning page. ([CVE-2012-1964](/security/CVE-2012-1964))

Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili discovered that javascript was not filtered out

of feed URLs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an

attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks. ([CVE-2012-1965](/security/CVE-2012-1965))

A vulnerability was discovered in the context menu of data: URLs. If the user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2012-1966](/security/CVE-2012-1966))

It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly

handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1967](/security/CVE-2012-1967))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/14.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

* In Ubuntu 11.04, unity-2d users may lose the ability to view drop-down menus,

  context menus, and perform drag-and-drop operations in Firefox. This is a known

  issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1020198> and may be fixed in a

  later update.

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

MozillaFirefox have been updated to the 10.0.6ESR security
release fixing various bugs and several security issues,
some critical.
The ollowing security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
\*
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman,
Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox
13.
\*
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher
Mario Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a
mechanism to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop
to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes
the address of the previously site entered to be displayed
in the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page.
This could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
\*
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya
used the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-afte.r-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
o CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased o CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode o
CVE-2012-1953: Out of bounds read in
ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor o CVE-2012-1952: Bad
cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
\*
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward
and history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
\*
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack through the context menu using a data: URL. In
this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show
only this frame", and "View background image") are
disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL,
allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher
Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed
in the HTML feed-view using tag within the RSS . This
problem is due to tags not being filtered out during
parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class
and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons
which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.
\*
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher
Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
\*
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony
Payne reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS,
Mozilla's color management library. With a carefully
crafted color profile portions of a user's memory could be
incorporated into a transformed image and possibly
deciphered.
\*
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer
Frederic Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header
is ignored when the value is duplicated, for example
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication
occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it
occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected
against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages.
\*
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher
Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher
Matt McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using
the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
\*
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers
Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla
allows the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL,
it is possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
\*
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution
attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to 14.0.1 to fix various bugs
and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed: MFSA 2012-42: Mozilla
developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence
of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
presume that with enough effort at least some of these
could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
CVE-2012-1949: Brian Smith, Gary Kwong, Christian Holler,
Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey,
and Kyle Huey reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 13.
CVE-2012-1948: Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian
Holler, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 13.
MFSA 2012-43 / CVE-2012-1950: Security researcher Mario
Gomes andresearch firm Code Audit Labs reported a mechanism
to short-circuit page loads through drag and drop to the
addressbar by canceling the page load. This causes the
address of the previously site entered to be displayed in
the addressbar instead of the currently loaded page. This
could lead to potential phishing attacks on users.
MFSA 2012-44 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya used
the Address Sanitizer tool to uncover four issues: two
use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug, and a
bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused when
an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but
attempts are made to call into objects in this array later.
The second use-after-free problem is in
nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document
and then adopts into another document, emptying the first
one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when
data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are
dereferenced. The bad cast happens when
nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in
aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
All four of these issues are potentially exploitable.
CVE-2012-1951: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILTimeValueSpec::IsEventBased CVE-2012-1954:
Heap-use-after-free in nsDocument::AdoptNode CVE-2012-1953:
Out of bounds read in ElementAnimations::EnsureStyleRuleFor
CVE-2012-1952: Bad cast in nsTableFrame::InsertFrames
MFSA 2012-45 / CVE-2012-1955: Security researcher Mariusz
Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the location
property. In this issue, calls to history.forward and
history.back are used to navigate to a site while
displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing
the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for
phishing by allowing the user input form or other data on
the newer, attacking, site while appearing to be on the
older, displayed site.
MFSA 2012-46 / CVE-2012-1966: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
through the context menu using a data: URL. In this issue,
context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show only this
frame", and "View background image") are disallowed in a
javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL, allowing for
XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
MFSA 2012-47 / CVE-2012-1957: Security researcher Mario
Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed in the
HTML feed-view using <embed> tag within the RSS
<description>. This problem is due to <embed> tags not
being filtered out during parsing and can lead to a
potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The flaw
existed in a parser utility class and could affect other
parts of the browser or add-ons which rely on that class to
sanitize untrusted input.
MFSA 2012-48 / CVE-2012-1958: Security researcher Arthur
Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a
use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when
mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used
afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for
remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-49 / CVE-2012-1959: Mozilla developer Bobby
Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW,
but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object
is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off and,
when the object is read read back, it is not known that
SCSW was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of
SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access
to the XBL that implements browser functionality.
MFSA 2012-50 / CVE-2012-1960: Google developer Tony Payne
reported an out of bounds (OOB) read in QCMS, Mozilla’s
color management library. With a carefully crafted color
profile portions of a user's memory could be incorporated
into a transformed image and possibly deciphered.
MFSA 2012-51 / CVE-2012-1961: Bugzilla developer Frédéric
Buclin reported that the "X-Frame-Options header is ignored
when the value is duplicated, for example X-Frame-Options:
SAMEORIGIN, SAMEORIGIN. This duplication occurs for unknown
reasons on some websites and when it occurs results in
Mozilla browsers not being protected against possible
clickjacking attacks on those pages.
MFSA 2012-52 / CVE-2012-1962: Security researcher Bill
Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by
JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string
into a fixed string when there are additional dependent
strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs
during conversion, the base data is freed, leaving other
dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to
a potentially exploitable crash.
MFSA 2012-53 / CVE-2012-1963: Security researcher
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at INRIA reported Content
Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the
"report-uri" location include sensitive data within the
"blocked-uri" parameter. These include fragment components
and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
different origin than the protected resource. This can be
used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and
OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
MFSA 2012-54 / CVE-2012-1964: Security Researcher Matt
McCutchen reported that a clickjacking attack using the
certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate
error warning page (about:certerror) with the "Add
Exception" button of a real warning page from a malicious
site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate
exception for a different site than the perceived one. This
can lead to compromised communications with the user
perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate
exception has been added.
MFSA 2012-55 / CVE-2012-1965: Security researchers Mario
Gomes and Soroush Dalili reported that since Mozilla allows
the pseudo-protocol feed: to prefix any valid URL, it is
possible to construct feed:javascript: URLs that will
execute scripts in some contexts. On some sites it may be
possible to use this to evade output filtering that would
otherwise strip javascript: URLs and thus contribute to
cross-site scripting (XSS) problems on these sites.
MFSA 2012-56 / CVE-2012-1967: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution attack
using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a
JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or
add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web
page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in
such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow
those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1088)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2012-1948, CVE-2012-1951, CVE-2012-1952, CVE-2012-1953,
CVE-2012-1954, CVE-2012-1958, CVE-2012-1962, CVE-2012-1967)

A malicious web page could bypass same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW)
and execute arbitrary code with chrome privileges. (CVE-2012-1959)

A flaw in the context menu functionality in Firefox could allow a malicious
website to bypass intended restrictions and allow a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1966)

A page different to that in the address bar could be displayed when
dragging and dropping to the address bar, possibly making it easier for a
malicious site or user to perform a phishing attack. (CVE-2012-1950)

A flaw in the way Firefox called history.forward and history.back could
allow an attacker to conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user
into believing they are viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2012-1955)

A flaw in a parser utility class used by Firefox to parse feeds (such as
RSS) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. This issue could have affected
other browser components or add-ons that assume the class returns
sanitized input. (CVE-2012-1957)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled X-Frame-Options headers could allow a
malicious website to perform a clickjacking attack. (CVE-2012-1961)

A flaw in the way Content Security Policy (CSP) reports were generated by
Firefox could allow a malicious web page to steal a victim's OAuth 2.0
access tokens and OpenID credentials. (CVE-2012-1963)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled certificate warnings could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to create a crafted warning, possibly tricking
a user into accepting an arbitrary certificate as trusted. (CVE-2012-1964)

A flaw in the way Firefox handled feed:javascript URLs could allow output
filtering to be bypassed, possibly leading to a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2012-1965)

The nss update RHBA-2012:0337 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
introduced a mitigation for the CVE-2011-3389 flaw. For compatibility
reasons, it remains disabled by default in the nss packages. This update
makes Firefox enable the mitigation by default. It can be disabled by
setting the NSS\_SSL\_CBC\_RANDOM\_IV environment variable to 0 before
launching Firefox. (BZ#838879)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.6 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill
McCloskey, Abhishek Arya, Arthur Gerkis, Bill Keese, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Bobby
Holley, Code Audit Labs, Mariusz Mlynski, Mario Heiderich, Frederic Buclin,
Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Matt McCutchen, Mario Gomes, and Soroush Dalili as
the original reporters of these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.6 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
