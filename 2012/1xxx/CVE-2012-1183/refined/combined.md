Subject: CVE Request -- Asterisk: AST-2012-002 and AST-2012-003 flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

1) AST-2012-002:

An out-of stack-based buffer write flaw was found in the way the Miliwatt
application of the Asterisk, open source telephony toolkit, performed
generation of constant audio tone at 1000Hz (the 'o' option) from certain,
provided audio packets, when the 'internal_timing' Asterisk configuration file
option was disabled. In this configuration, a remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted audio packet file, which once processed by the Miliwatt
application would lead to that application crash, or, potentially arbitrary
code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

Upstream security advisory:
[1] <http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-002.pdf>

Asterisk v1.8.10.1 announcement:
[2] <http://www.asterisk.org/node/51797>

Upstream patch against the v1.8 branch:

References:
[4] <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=408431>
[5] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=804038>

2) AST-2012-003:

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Asterisk Manager
Interface of Asterisk, open source telephony toolkit, performed processing of
certain HTTP Digest Authentication headers. A remote attacker, attempting to
connect to the HTTP session could send a HTTP Digest Authentication header with
specially-crafted values for certain fields, which once processed by the
Asterisk parse digest authorization header functionality would lead to asterisk
crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
running the application.

Upstream security advisory:

Could you allocate two ids for these issues?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1183 CVE-2012-2414 CVE-2012-2415

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Asterisk PBX and telephony
toolkit:

CVE-2012-1183

   Russell Bryant discovered a buffer overflow in the Milliwatt
   application.

CVE-2012-2414

   David Woolley discovered a privilege escalation in the Asterisk
   manager interface.

CVE-2012-2415

   Russell Bryant discovered a buffer overflow in the Skinny driver.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

CVE Name

Description

Matt Jordan <mjordan AT digium DOT com>

An attacker can cause Asterisk to crash in one of two ways:
1. A dialplan uses the Milliwatt application with 'o' option
2. The internal_timing option in asterisk.conf is off
3. The attacker sends a large audio packet.  The number of samples in the audio
packet determines the number of internal data samples that are copied into the
buffer. This overruns the buffer, potentially causing a crash.
OR
1. A dialplan uses the Milliwatt application with the 'o' option
2. The attacker negotiates a media format with a sampling rate greater than
32kHz.  The application will attempt to generate an audio packet using the
sample rate of the negotiated format, where the sample rate will require a
number of data points greater then the size of the buffer.  Again, the the
application copies a number of internal data samples into the buffer that are
greater then the size of the buffer, potentially causing a crash.

Note that the latter attack vector is only possible in Asterisk 10, as it supports
codecs with a sample rate greater then 32kHz.

Resolution

Upgrade to one of the versions of Asterisk listed in the “Corrected In” section, or
apply a patch specified in the “Patches” section.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=804038#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-16 11:38:25 UTC  ``` An out-of stack-based buffer write flaw was found in the way the Miliwatt application of the Asterisk, open source telephony toolkit, performed generation of constant audio tone at 1000Hz (the 'o' option) from certain, provided audio packets, when the 'internal_timing' Asterisk configuration file option was disabled. In this configuration, a remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted audio packet file, which once processed by the Miliwatt application would lead to that application crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
