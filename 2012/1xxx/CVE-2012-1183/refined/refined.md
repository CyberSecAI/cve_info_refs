Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-1183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `milliwatt_generate` function of the `app_milliwatt.c` file within the Asterisk application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The `milliwatt_generate` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. When the 'o' option is used with internal timing disabled, the size of data copied from a received audio packet to the buffer is not correctly validated against the buffer's size. Specifically,  the number of samples in the audio packet determines the amount of data copied, which can overflow the buffer.
- **Missing Bounds Check:** The code fails to properly check if the amount of data to be copied exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the Asterisk application to crash due to the stack buffer overflow, rendering the service unavailable.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed in all sources, some descriptions suggest the possibility of arbitrary code execution if an attacker carefully crafts the overflow to overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack. This would grant the attacker control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who is not authenticated.
- **Specifically Crafted Audio Packets:** An attacker sends a specially crafted audio packet to a vulnerable Asterisk instance using the Milliwatt application and the 'o' option.
- **Internal Timing Disabled**: Exploitation requires that the 'internal_timing' option in the Asterisk configuration is disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to an Asterisk server.
- The attacker must be able to send audio packets to the vulnerable service, using the Milliwatt application with the 'o' option enabled and internal timing disabled.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability is required to craft the malicious audio packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `milliwatt_generate` function when generating a constant 1000Hz tone with the 'o' option.
*   The issue is related to processing the number of samples in the audio packet, where the number of samples determines how much internal data is copied into a buffer which can overflow.
*   The vulnerability can also be triggered by negotiating a media format with a sampling rate greater than 32kHz in Asterisk 10, as the application will attempt to generate an audio packet with the sample rate of the negotiated format which will require more data points than the size of the buffer.
*   The issue affects multiple versions of Asterisk, including 1.4.x, 1.6.x, 1.8.x, and 10.x.
*   Patches were released to address the vulnerability by correcting the buffer size check.
