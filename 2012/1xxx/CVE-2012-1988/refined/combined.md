Package        : puppet
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2012-1906 CVE-2012-1986 CVE-2012-1987 CVE-2012-1988

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in puppet, a centralized
configuration management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-1906

    Puppet is using predictable temporary file names when downloading
    Mac OS X package files.  This allows a local attacker to either
    overwrite arbitrary files on the system or to install an arbitrary
    package.

CVE-2012-1986

    When handling requests for a file from a remote filebucket, puppet
    can be tricked into overwriting its defined location for filebucket
    storage.  This allows an authorized attacker with access to the puppet
    master to read arbitrary files.

CVE-2012-1987

    Puppet is incorrectly handling filebucket store requests.  This allows
    an attacker to perform denial of service attacks against puppet by
    resource exhaustion.

CVE-2012-1988

    Puppet is incorrectly handling filebucket requests.  This allows an
    attacker with access to the certificate on the agent and an unprivileged
    account on puppet master to execute arbitrary code via crafted file
    path names and making a filebucket request.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.13-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.13-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.

# USN-1419-1: Puppet vulnerabilities

11 April 2012

Several security issues were fixed in puppet.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [puppet](/security/cves?package=puppet) - Centralized configuration management

## Details

It was discovered that Puppet used a predictable filename when downloading Mac

OS X package files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary

files. ([CVE-2012-1906](/security/CVE-2012-1906))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled filebucket retrieval

requests. A local attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary files.

([CVE-2012-1986](/security/CVE-2012-1986))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled filebucket store requests. A

local attacker could exploit this to perform a denial of service via resource

exhaustion. ([CVE-2012-1987](/security/CVE-2012-1987))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled filebucket requests. A local

attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file path.

([CVE-2012-1988](/security/CVE-2012-1988))

It was discovered that Puppet used a predictable filename for the Telnet

connection log file. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary

files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.10. ([CVE-2012-1989](/security/CVE-2012-1989))
