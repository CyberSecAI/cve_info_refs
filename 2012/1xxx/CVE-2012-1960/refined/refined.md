  "cve_id": "CVE-2012-1960",
  "vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read in QCMS.",
  "affected_components": [
    "Mozilla Firefox",
     "Mozilla Thunderbird",
     "SeaMonkey",
     "Xerox FreeFlow Print Server"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the QCMS library, Mozilla's color management library.",
  "impact": "With a carefully crafted color profile, portions of a user's memory could be incorporated into a transformed image and possibly deciphered. Could potentially cause a denial of service via application crash.",
  "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted color profile.",
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious color profile. An attacker can entice a user into opening such a profile through a website, email attachment or other means.",
   "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs in the `qcms_transform_data_rgb_out_lut_sse2` function. The fix ensures that the output of the TRC (Tone Reproduction Curve) is always between 0 and 1. The issue is triggered by a crafted parametric curve in the color profile, which can lead to complex or undefined values for the input range. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the gamma table is accessed out of bounds due to the calculation of a value outside of the range between 0 and 1. The fix involves sanitizing the gamma tables and ensuring that the d parameter of the parametric curve does not cause issues. The fix landed under [bug 764181](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=764181) to make the security hole less obvious."
