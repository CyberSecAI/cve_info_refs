[Mark Meijers](http://www.markmeijers.com) wrote 12 years ago

I have an issue:

after selecting a theme to use, I cannot edit the .tpl files anymore. I can edit them, but the changes won't be visible on the website. The only way to apply the changes is to copy the altered theme and rename the entire theme. Could this be fixed or am I doing something wrong?

Have you set debug to true?
