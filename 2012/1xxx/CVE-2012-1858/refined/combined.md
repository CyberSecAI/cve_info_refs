# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-034 - Critical

## Combined Security Update for Microsoft Office, Windows, .NET Framework, and Silverlight (2681578)

Published: May 08, 2012 | Updated: March 06, 2013

**Version:** 1.6

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and seven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows, the Microsoft .NET Framework, and Microsoft Silverlight. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits a malicious webpage that embeds TrueType font files. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows; for Microsoft .NET Framework 4, except when installed on Itanium-based editions of Microsoft Windows; and for Microsoft Silverlight 4 and Microsoft Silverlight 5. This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2007, and Microsoft Office 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the most severe of these vulnerabilities by correcting the manner in which affected components handle specially crafted TrueType font files and by correcting the manner in which GDI+ validates specially crafted EMF record types and specially crafted EMF images embedded within Microsoft Office files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2681578](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681578) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**I have a non-vulnerable version of software installed, why am I being offered security update KB2589337?**

Some non-affected software, including Microsoft Visio Viewer 2010, contain the vulnerable shared component of Microsoft Office, but because they do not access the vulnerable code, they are not affected. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.

**I am running Windows Server 2008. Why am I not being offered security update KB2660649?**

Security update package KB2660649 is only applicable on Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2008 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 2 systems when the optional [Desktop Experience feature](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772567%28v%3Dws.10%29.aspx) has been installed and enabled. Windows Server 2008 customers who have installed and enabled the Desktop Experience feature will have the vulnerable component addressed by KB2660649 and will therefore need to install this security update. Customers who have not installed the Desktop Experience feature or who have installed but not enabled the feature will not have the vulnerable component and will therefore not be offered security update package KB2660649.

**I am running Windows Server 2008 R2. Why am I not being offered security update KB2660649?**

Security update package KB2660649 is only applicable on Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems and Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1 systems when the Ink Support component of the optional [Ink and Handwriting Services feature](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd759248.aspx) has been installed and enabled. Windows Server 2008 R2 customers who have installed and enabled the Ink Support component of the Ink and Handwriting Services feature will have the vulnerable component addressed by KB2660649 and will therefore need to install this security update. Customers who have not installed the Ink Support component of the Ink and Handwriting Services feature or who have installed but not enabled the feature will not have the vulnerable component and will therefore not be offered security update package KB2660649.

**I am running one of the operating systems that** **are** **listed in the affected software table** **for security update** **KB2658846. Why am I not being offered this** **update?**

Security update KB2658846 will only be offered to systems on which the affected component (DirectWrite) is installed.

**Note** On supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, DirectWrite is not installed by default. On these operating systems, DirectWrite is installed as part of any of the following updates: [Windows Graphics, Imaging, and XPS Library (KB971512)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/971512), [Platform Update Supplement (KB2117917)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2117917), or the [Update for DirectWrite and XPS (KB2505189)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505189). Note that these updates are offered through automatic updating.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.

**Why are multiple package updates available for** **my software?**

The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different package updates as indicated in the **Affected Software** table due to the componentized servicing model of the software. To be protected from the vulnerabilities, all updates available for any affected software are required, but they do not need to be installed in a particular order.

**There** **is more than one update** **listed for the** **software** **installed on my system. Do I need to install all of the updates?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of software can be applied in any sequence.

**What is defense-in-depth?**

In information security, defense-in-depth refers to an approach in which multiple layers of defense are in place to help prevent attackers from compromising the security of a network or system.

**Are there special** **requirements related** **to applying** **the** **security update packages that address** **CVE-2012-0181?**

Yes. The detection logic for the security update package identified as KB2686509 performs an eligibility check of the system in order to verify whether the system meets the requirements to activate the fix applied by KB2676562, which addresses CVE-2012-0181. If the system meets the requirements, both KB2686509 and KB2676562 will be successfully installed on the system and the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0181 will be addressed. Otherwise, KB2686509 will be re-offered until the system does meet the requirements. Successful installation of both the KB2686509 and KB2676562 update packages are necessary to be protected against CVE-2012-0181 on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems. If your system does not meet the requirements to install the update, please follow the guidance documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2686509](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2686509).

**I have Microsoft Office 2010 installed on my system. Why might I not be offered update package KB2589337** **for** **Microsoft Office 2010?**

The vulnerabilities addressed by update package KB2589337 only affect Microsoft Office 2010 when installed on systems running Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Therefore, the Microsoft Office 2010 update KB2589337 will not be offered to systems running Windows Vista or later versions of Microsoft Windows.

**Is** **this security update related to** **MS12-035,** **Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution?**

No. Although both of these security updates affect the .NET Framework, the updates affect different components and are not related. These updates may be applied in any order.

**Is** **Windows** **8 Consumer** **Preview affected by** **any of the** **vulnerabilities addressed in this bulletin?**

Yes. The KB2658846, KB2660649, and KB2676562 updates are available for the Windows 8 Consumer Preview release. Customers with Windows 8 Consumer Preview are encouraged to apply the updates to their systems. The updates are only available on [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**How do I know which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed?**

If Microsoft Silverlight is already installed on your computer, you can visit the [Get Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/get-started/install/) page, which will indicate which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight are currently installed on your system. Alternatively, you can use the Manage Add-Ons feature of current versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer to determine the version and build information that is currently installed.

You can also manually check the version number of sllauncher.exe located in the "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x86 Microsoft Windows systems) or in the "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x64 Microsoft Windows systems).

In addition, on Microsoft Windows, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found in the registry at [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x86 Microsoft Windows systems, or [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x64 Microsoft Windows systems.

On Apple Mac OS, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found as follows:

1. Open the **Finder**
2. Select the system drive and go to the folder **Internet Plug-ins - Library**
3. Right-click the file **Silverlight.Plugin** (if your mouse has only one button, press the **Ctrl** key while clicking on the file) to bring up the context menu, then click **Show Package Contents**
4. Inside the contents folder, locate the file **info.plist** and open it with an editor. It will contain an entry like this, which shows you the version number:
   SilverlightVersion
   4.1.10329
   or
   SilverlightVersion
   5.1.10411

The version installed with this security update for Microsoft Silverlight 4 is 4.1.10329. If your Microsoft Silverlight 4 version number is higher than or equal to this version number, your system is not vulnerable. The version installed with this security update for Microsoft Silverlight 5 is 5.1.10411. If your Microsoft Silverlight 5 version number is higher than or equal to this version number, your system is not vulnerable.

**How do I upgrade my version of Microsoft Silverlight?**

The Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature helps makes sure that your Microsoft Silverlight installation is kept up to date with the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, Microsoft Silverlight functionality, and security features. For more information about the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature, see the [Microsoft Silverlight Updater](https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/resources/documentation/updater.aspx). Customers who have disabled the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature can enroll in [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) to obtain the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, or download the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight manually using the download link in the Affected Software table in the earlier section, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**. For information about deploying Microsoft Silverlight in an enterprise environment, see the [Silverlight Enterprise Deployment Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=119611).

## TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3402

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected components handle a specially crafted TrueType font file. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted TrueType font file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3402](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3402).

#### Mitigating Factors for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3402

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables font download by default. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario. The vulnerability could also be exploited if a user opens an attachment that is sent in an email message.

#### Workarounds for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3402

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

* **Deny access to T2EMBED.DLL**

  **Note** Before applying this workaround, users should apply the latest Microsoft security updates. If you are not sure whether your software is up to date, visit [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747), scan your computer for available updates, and install any high-priority updates that are offered to you.

  **Note** For this workaround, commands for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 may only work in English language versions of these operating systems.

  **Note** This workaround only mitigates the web-based and file sharing attack scenarios related to the Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers. The local Kernel-Mode Drivers attack scenario, and all other attack scenarios that leverage code in other affected Windows components, Microsoft Office and Microsoft Silverlight will not be mitigated by this workaround.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639417](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639417) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround to deny access to t2embed.dll.

  **On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    `Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N`
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands from an administrative command prompt:

    `Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N`

    `Echo y| cacls "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N`

  **On Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2:**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

    `Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"`

    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /deny *S-1-1-0:(F)`
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

    `Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"`

    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /deny *S-1-1-0:(F)`

    `Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll"`

    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /deny *S-1-1-0:(F)`

  **Impact of Workaround.**

  + Applications that rely on embedded font technology will fail to display properly.
  + After applying this workaround, users of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 may be reoffered the KB982132 and KB972270 security updates. These reoffered updates will fail to install. The reoffering is a detection logic issue and users who have successfully applied both the KB982132 and KB972270 security updates previously can ignore the reoffer.
  + Applications with functionality that relies on T2EMBED.DLL, such as generating PDF files, may fail to work as expected. For example, Microsoft Office software will fail to generate PDF files.
  + Microsoft Office 2003 software with the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack may fail to open PowerPoint 2007 (.pptx) files; instead, generating the message, "This file was created by a newer version of Microsoft PowerPoint. Do you want to download a compatibility pack so that you can work with this file?", even though the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack is already installed.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    `cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /R everyone`
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

    `cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /R everyone`

    `cacls "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /E /R everyone`

  On Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.DLL" /remove:d *S-1-1-0`
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.DLL" /remove:d *S-1-1-0`

    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.DLL" /remove:d *S-1-1-0`

#### FAQ for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0159

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the incorrect handling of specially crafted TTF files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability through the Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers could run arbitrary code in kernel mode and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability through Microsoft Silverlight, Microsoft Office or other affected Windows components could gain the same user rights as the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system.

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## .NET Framework Buffer Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0162

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft .NET Framework that can allow a specially crafted Microsoft .NET Framework application to access memory in an unsafe manner. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0162](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0162).

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET Framework Buffer Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0162

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and only in a web browsing attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx).
* On systems where [MS11-044](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms11-044) has been applied, users will be prompted before XBAP applications will execute when in the Internet Zone of Internet Explorer. A user must click through this prompt in order to run the XBAP application on their system.

#### Workarounds for .NET Framework Buffer Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0162

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for .NET Framework Buffer Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0162

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Microsoft .NET Framework improperly allocates a buffer in memory.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In the web browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are two attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a web browsing scenario and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing attack scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
* **Windows .NET applications attack scenario**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the web browsing scenario and systems that are using the Windows .NET applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  Workstations and server that run untrusted Windows .NET applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft .NET Framework allocates buffer space in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## .NET Framework Index Comparison Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0164

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for GDI+ Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0167

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable metafile processing**

  Customers who have applied [MS07-017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=84687) or customers using Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 can disable metafile processing by modifying the registry. This setting will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  To modify the key, perform the following steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit**, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize
  3. On the **Edit** menu, select **New**, and then click **DWORD**.
  4. Type **DisableMetaFiles**, and then press **ENTER**.
  5. On the **Edit** menu, click **Modify** to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.
  6. In the **Value** data box, type **1**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Exit Registry Editor.
  8. Restart the computer.

  To disable metafile processing using a managed deployment script, perform the following steps:

  1. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Disable\_MetaFiles.reg):

     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize]

     "DisableMetaFiles"=dword:00000001
  2. Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an administrator command prompt:

     Regedit.exe /s Disable\_MetaFiles.reg
  3. Restart the computer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Turning off processing of metafiles may cause the performance of software or system components to decrease in functionality. Turning off processing of metafiles may also cause the software or system components to fail completely. Evaluate the applicability of this workaround. Examples of adverse results include the following:

  + You cannot print on the computer.
  + Some applications on the computer may be unable to display Clipart.
  + Some applications that involve OLE rendering may break, especially when the object server is not active.

#### Workarounds for Silverlight Double-Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0176

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer (Method 1)**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{DFEAF541-F3E1-4C24-ACAC-99C30715084A}]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  ```

  Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications and websites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.
* **Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Firefox or Chrome**

  To modify the registry key to disable Microsoft Silverlight, follow these steps:

#### FAQ for Silverlight Double-Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0176

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Silverlight incorrectly freeing memory while rendering specially crafted XAML glyphs.

**What is Microsoft Silverlight?**

Microsoft Silverlight is a cross-browser, cross-platform implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework for building media experiences and rich interactive applications for the web. For more information, see the official site of [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/).

**What are XAML Glyphs?**

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) provides advanced text support including glyph-level markup with direct access to [Glyphs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.windows.documents.glyphs.aspx) for customers who want to intercept and persist text after formatting. These features provide critical support for the different text rendering requirements in each of the following scenarios: screen display of fixed-format documents, print scenarios, and fixed-format document representation, including clients for previous versions of Windows and other computing devices. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Introduction to the GlyphRun Object and Glyphs Element](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms748985.aspx).

**What is** **a "double free" condition?**

A double free condition is a condition in which a program is caused to release or free allocated memory more than once. Releasing memory that has already been freed could lead to memory corruption. An attacker could add arbitrary code to memory that is then executed when the corruption occurs. This code could then be executed at a system level of privilege.

Typically, this vulnerability causes a denial of service to occur. However, in some circumstances, it could cause code execution to occur. Because of the unique layout of the memory on each affected system, exploiting this vulnerability on a mass scale could be difficult.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In the web browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted Silverlight application that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating Silverlight applications. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this issue by correcting the manner in which Microsoft Silverlight resets pointers when freeing memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723): Summary list of monthly detection and deployment guidance articles.

**Note** If you have used an Administrative Installation Point (AIP) for deploying Office XP or Office 2003, you may not be able to deploy the update using SMS if you have updated the AIP from the original baseline. For more information, see the **Office Administrative Installation Point** heading in this section.

**Office Administrative Installation Point**

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system.

* For supported versions of Microsoft Office XP, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](https://office.microsoft.com/orkxp/ha011363091033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client system from an updated administrative installation point to an Office XP original baseline source, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922665](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922665).

  **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article [Updating Office XP Clients from a Patched Administrative Image](https://office.microsoft.com/orkxp/ha011525721033.aspx).
* For supported versions of Microsoft Office 2003, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011401931033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client computer from an updated administrative installation point to an Office 2003 original baseline source or Service Pack 3 (SP3), see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 902349](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/902349).

  **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article, [Distributing Office 2003 Product Updates](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011402381033.aspx?pid=ch011480761033).

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches for Microsoft Windows Server 2003.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

This security update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 supports the following setup switches.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying That** **the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1849](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1849).

#### Mitigating Factors for Lync Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1849

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate file (such as an .ocsmeet file) from this location that is then loaded by a vulnerable application.
* The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Lync Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1849

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

  Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block the loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
* **Disable the** **WebClient** **service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for Lync Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1849

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Lync incorrectly restricts the path used for loading external libraries.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate Microsoft Lync related file (such as an .ocsmeet file) that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Microsoft Lync could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a legitimate Microsoft Lync-related file (such as an .ocsmeet file) to a user, and convincing the user to place the attachment into a directory that contains a specially crafted DLL file and to open the legitimate file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Microsoft Lync could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In a network attack scenario, an attacker could place a legitimate Microsoft Lync-related file and a specially crafted DLL in a network share, a UNC, or WebDAV location and then convince the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Lync is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Lync loads external libraries.

**Is this vulnerability related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**

Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs item in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

Security Bulletin

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-037 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2699988)

Published: June 12, 2012

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and twelve privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Internet Explorer 9 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Internet Explorer 9 on Windows servers. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, HTML sanitization using toStaticHTML, the way that Internet Explorer renders data during certain processes, and the way that Internet Explorer creates and initializes strings. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Center Element Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1523

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1523).

#### Mitigating Factors for Center Element Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1523

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 9 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Center Element Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1523

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Center Element Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1523

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.

#### FAQ for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1858

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who exploited the vulnerability when a user views a webpage that uses the toStaticHTML method may execute a cross-site scripting attack on the user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way that the toStaticHTML API included in Internet Explorer handles content using specific strings when sanitizing HTML.

**What is the toStaticHTMLmethod?**

The toStaticHTML method can be used to remove event attributes and script from user input before display as HTML. For more information, see [toStaticHTML method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc848922.aspx).

**Is this vulnerability related to CVE-2012-1858 in MS12-039, Vulnerabilities in Lync Could Allow Remote Code Execution?**

Yes, the HTML Sanitization Vulnerability, CVE-2012-1858, also affects Microsoft Lync.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks against users who are viewing a website that uses the toStaticHTML method to sanitize HTML. An attacker could then potentially run script on behalf of a victim user who is on the site.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a website. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the websites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles HTML sanitization using the toStaticHTML method.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## EUC-JP Character Encoding Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1872

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow script to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by inserting specially crafted strings in to a website, resulting in information disclosure when a user viewed the website.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1872](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1872).

#### Mitigating Factors for EUC-JP Character Encoding Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1872

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.

  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Col Element Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1876

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that doesn't exist, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

## Title Element Change Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1877

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1877](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1877).

#### Mitigating Factors for Title Element Change Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1877

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Title Element Change Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1877

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

#### Mitigating Factors for insertAdjacentText Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1879

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for insertAdjacentText Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1879

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

#### FAQ for insertAdjacentText Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1879

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an undefined memory location, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

#### FAQ for OnRowsInserted Event Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1881

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Scrolling Events Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1882

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker to gain access to information in another domain or Internet Explorer zone. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted webpage that could allow information disclosure if a user viewed the webpage. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1882](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1882).

#### Mitigating Factors for Scrolling Events Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1882

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Scrolling Events Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1882

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

### [Building Rich Internet Applications Models: Example of a Better Strategy](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/06/building-rich-internet-applications-models-example-of-a-better-strategy.html)

Crawling “classical” web applications is a problem that has been addressed more than a decode ago. Efficient crawling of web applications that use advanced technologies such as AJAX (called Rich Internet Applications, RIAs) is still an open problem. Crawling is important not only for indexing content, but also for building models of the applications, which is necessary for automated testing, automated security and accessibility assessments and in general for using software engineering tools. This paper presents a new strategy to crawl RIAs. It uses the concept of Model-Based Crawling (MBC) and introduces a new model, the “menu model”, which we show to be much simpler than previous models for MBC and more effective at building models than previously published methods. This method and others are compared against a set of experimental and real RIAs.

The [SSRG](http://ssrg.eecs.uottawa.ca/members.html) research team will present these findings at ICWE 2013, 11 July@16:00, Aalborg, North Denmark.

### [AppScan Enterprise v8.7 performance improvements](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/05/appscan-enterprise-v87-performance-improvements.html)

In March 2013, we released version 8.7 of AppScan. One of
the focus areas for that release was to improve the scalability and performance
of the enterprise components of the solution, specifically the AppScan
Enterprise Server and AppScan Enterprise Dynamic Analysis Scanner. The
Engineering team made some architecture changes, which  helped dramatically improve the performance
and scalability of these components. In this blog entry, I'd like to provide an
overview of these changes and their effect.

First, the Engineering team separated the database tables
for storing information during the execution of a scan from the central AppScan
Enterprise Server database and moved those tables into a local built-in
database on the AppScan Enterprise Dynamic Analysis Scanner (DAST scan server).  In the previous versions of the product, the
scan server wrote data into the AppScan Enterprise Server central database
throughout the entire duration of the scan. This consumed a lot of resources on
the database server which affected the Web UI performance and greatly limited
the number of scans you could run simultaneously on a scan server. There were
also latency concerns depending on where the scan server was located in
relation to the database server. In version 8.7, scan data is written into a
local built-in database on the scan server. Data is transferred to the central
database on the AppScan Enterprise Server only at the end of a scan (in one
batch). This improved the performance of the Web UI, enabled running more
simultaneous scans on a single scan server and addressed the latency concerns
when the scan server is located far from the database server.

Figures 1 and 2 for a depiction of the implemented architecture
changes.

[![1](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0192aa5744f7970d-800wi "1")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0192aa5744f7970d-pi)

[![2](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0191028ed660970c-800wi "2")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0191028ed660970c-pi)

Another implementation change made by the Engineering team
was removing the old encryption mechanism for protecting data
"at-rest".  When deploying
v8.7, we recommend that AppScan Enterprise administrators enable the Microsoft
SQL Server Enterprise Edition (2008 and higher) built-in mechanism for data
encryption, Transparent DATA Encryption (TDE), which provides much better
performance.  Alternatively,
administrators could use Encrypting File System which comes with Windows.

So here are the results of the efforts of the Engineering
team:

* Web UI responsiveness has
  increased by approximately 50%
* Scan and reporting
  performance has increased by approximately 50%
* 4-5 scans can run at the
  same time on single DAST scan server
* DAST scan servers can be
  deployed remotely from central AppScan Enterprise Server

We hope that the improved robustness of these
AppScan components will help enhance your overall experience with the product.

### [Research Awards for Project on Crawling Mobile and Rich Internet Applications](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/01/research-awards-for-project-on-crawling-mobile-and-rich-internet-applications.html)

**2012  IBM CAS Project of the Year:****Efficient and Scalable Mapping of Mobile and Complex Rich Internet
Applications for Automated Security Testing**

The ability
to “crawl” Web sites and Web applications is at the core of the Internet.
Crawling is necessary to indexing, searching and security testing operations.
With the rise of “Rich Internet Applications” (RIA) there is a tremendous gain
in end-user experience, but it is becoming harder to automatically crawl these
Web sites. Another recent evolution in computing is the move to everything
mobile. Mobile applications are bound to replace desktop applications in the
coming years. It is therefore critical to develop crawling tools adapted to
this new paradigm.

The objective of
this research is to provide efficient and scalable crawling techniques that
work on real life RIAs and mobile applications, and does so entirely
automatically. It builds on the results of our previous research, but tackles
the open problem that some RIA are simply too large to be crawled exhaustively.

The project was awarded by
IBM with the "Project of the year 2012" distinction based on the
following criteria:

* Excel as a research center for the
  advancements of applied science in research areas strategic to IBM
* Harvest and transfer results from advanced research to strategic products and
  initiatives
* Build and foster relationships among researchers, IBM and Customers
* Expose IBM developers to current research directions, and identify new and
  emerging technology issues for academic research.

The award was presented at [CASCON 2012](https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/awards.jsp#CAS%20Research%20Project%20of%20the%20Year%20Award).
The research is done in collaboration with [University of Ottawa](http://ssrg.site.uottawa.ca/).

### [Find Security Vulnerabilities in Android Apps](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/12/scan-android-apps.html)

Mobile security can be tested in a variety of ways. You can apply black box testing to test the server side logic that your mobile app is working with, **[as we've recently blogged about](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/have-you-scanned-your-mobile-site-for-vulnerabilities-yet.html)**.

You can also apply static analysis to test the client side. The following short video shows exactly how that's done using IBM Security AppScan Source Edition:

For a more complete overview of mobile security, **[check out the webcast](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/08/the-new-frontier-securing-mobile-apps.html)** we've recently published.

### [Understanding AppScan Test Policies](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/12/understanding-appscan-test-policies.html)

IBM Security Appscan provides automated security scanning of web applications.

Did you know that you can apply **test policies** within IBM Security AppScan to cover particular aspects of the scan? Using the right policy produces optimal scanning results and reduces false positives.

[![Figure-02](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef017c3439d2c0970b-800wi "Figure-02")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef017c3439d2c0970b-pi)

In **[this great article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-appscan/)**, you can get an overview of IBM Security AppScan test policies, and learn which policy is optimal based on the type of application and its stage of development. The article also provides a side-by-side policy comparison that details each scan policy that is offered by the IBM Security AppScan tool.

### [Have you scanned your mobile site for vulnerabilities yet?](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/have-you-scanned-your-mobile-site-for-vulnerabilities-yet.html)

**Mobile sites - Resurrecting security risks**

In today's world any self respecting web site must provide access to its services through a desktop browser **as well as** a mobile device. This basically means that there are **two versions to every site**, one for desktop users and one for mobile users. Are both secure? How do we know for sure?

First, let's take a quick look at some of the reasons why companies would prefer to have mobile users visit a mobile-based site instead of directing them to the original desktop site.

* Technologies - There are certain technologies that are not supported on a mobile device (e.g. Flash on iOS) that would have to be re-designed to meet smartphone requirements.
* User experience - The user experience is completely different. For example, take the hover action, a desktop user can hover over a certain area and have menus sliding this way and that. But on a mobile device hovering does not exist.

### [Top 5 Innovations Transforming Security Scanners](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/top-5-innovations-transforming-security-scanners.html)

*Like the web itself, security scanners are advancing at a fast pace. Here are the top 5 technologies that leading security professionals are applying to stay ahead of the curve:*

**5. XSS Analyzer**

The "classic" black box approach for detecting XSS relies on sending a bulk of tests based on a “cheat sheet” of around a hundred different payloads. This is a reasonable approach for an automated tool, but it isn’t very sophisticated.

Mimicking a human attacker, **[XSS Analyzer](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/07/announcing-xss-analyzer.html)** is a learning system that follows a disciplined step-by-step approach. XSS Analyzer learns the defense patterns of an application, and finds ways to defeat those defenses. This allows XSS Analyzer to find vulnerabilities that could never be found automatically before, with higher accuracy and less time.

### [String Analysis in AppScan/JSA](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/string-analysis-in-appscanjsa.html)

Let's see how **[String Analysis](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/what-is-string-analysis.html)** is used to improve the accuracy of **[JSA](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/06/by-now-you-have-probably-heard-about-jsa-introduced-inappscan-standard80-in-oct-10-jsa-is-a-component-that-does-static-ana.html)**.

Consider the following real-world example:

var str = document.URL;
 var url\_check = str.indexOf('login.html');
 if (url\_check > -1) {
    result = str.substring(0,url\_check);
    result = result + 'login.jsp' + str.substring((url\_check+search\_term.length), str.length);
    document.URL = result;
 }

Any standard **[taint analysis](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~omertrip/pldi09/paper.pdf)** would argue that this code is vulnerable to **[Open Redirect](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect)**, since the value of the untrusted variable "str" flows into the assignment "document.URL = result"; this presumably allows an attacker to control the URL target of a redirect operation, which means that phishing is possible.

However, closer inspection reveals there is no vulnerability here: while part of the target URL can indeed be controlled by an attacker (the request parameters), the *target hostname* of the redirection is beyond the attacker's control.

So what could we do?

### [What is String Analysis? A look at one of AppScan's breakthrough technologies](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/what-is-string-analysis.html)

The best technologies are often the ones that you, as a user, never have to worry about. They work automatically, behind the scenes, making a product or service work better. With nothing to configure, nothing new to learn. They just work.

**String Analysis** is such a technology. If you think of it, it's a thing of beauty. Because String Analysis is actually one of the most complicated analysis technologies that IBM (or anyone) has ever developed in the world of static analysis.

## Vulnerabilities in SharePoint Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2695502)

Published: July 10, 2012 | Updated: January 15, 2014

**Version:** 2.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and five privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint and Windows SharePoint Services. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft InfoPath 2007, Microsoft InfoPath 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, and Microsoft Groove Server 2010; and for supported versions of Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 2.0, Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, and SharePoint Foundation 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that HTML strings are sanitized and by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2695502](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2695502) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

**What is Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010?**

[Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/sharepoint/ee263910.aspx) is the new version of Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services. It is the essential solution for organizations that need a secure, manageable, Web-based collaboration platform. SharePoint helps teams stay connected and productive by providing easy access to the people, documents, and information that they need to make well-informed decisions and get work done. Use SharePoint Foundation to coordinate schedules, organize documents, and participate in discussions through team workspaces, blogs, wikis, and document libraries on the platform that is the underlying infrastructure for SharePoint Server.

**What is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0?**

[Windows SharePoint Services 3.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/sharepoint/bb684453) provides a platform for collaborative applications, offering a common framework for document management and a common repository for storing documents of all types. It exposes key Windows Server services like Windows Workflow Services and Windows Rights Management Services.

Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 is provided as a free download for supported editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.

**How is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 related to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?**

Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server capabilities built on top of Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.

For systems with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 installed, you will need to apply the KB2596911 update for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. There is no configuration where you can only have Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and not Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.

#### FAQ for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1858

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a site that is filtering HTML content via SafeHTML.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that HTML strings are sanitized.

**What is cross-site scripting?**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a website. The vulnerability can affect web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the websites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks against users of a targeted site where HTML strings are sanitized. An attacker could then potentially run script on behalf of a victim user on the site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target site that use HTML sanitization. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations the specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content.

For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted specially crafted script to a target site that use HTML sanitization, any webpage on that site that contains the specially crafted script is a potential vector for persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a webpage that contains the specially crafted script, the script could be run in the security context of the user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where users connect to a site that sanitizes HTML strings, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that HTML strings are sanitized.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2012-1858](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1858).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Note** If you have used an Administrative Installation Point (AIP) for deploying Office XP or Office 2003, you may not be able to deploy the update using SMS if you have updated the AIP from the original baseline. For more information, see the **Office Administrative Installation Point** heading in this section.

**Office Administrative Installation Point**

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system.

* For supported versions of Microsoft Office XP, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](https://office.microsoft.com/orkxp/ha011363091033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client system from an updated administrative installation point to an Office XP original baseline source, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922665](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922665).

  **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article [Updating Office XP Clients from a Patched Administrative Image](https://office.microsoft.com/orkxp/ha011525721033.aspx).
* For supported versions of Microsoft Office 2003, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011401931033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client computer from an updated administrative installation point to an Office 2003 original baseline source or Service Pack 3 (SP3), see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 902349](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/902349).

  **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article, [Distributing Office 2003 Product Updates](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011402381033.aspx?pid=ch011480761033).
* For creating a network installation point for supported versions of Microsoft Office, see [Create a network installation point for Microsoft Office](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179063.aspx).

  **Note** If you plan to manage security updates centrally, use Windows Server Update Services. For more information about how to deploy security updates for Microsoft Office, visit the [Windows Server Update Services website](https://technet.microsoft.com/wsus/default.aspx).

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

# HTML reference

This [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) reference describes all **elements** and **attributes** of HTML, including **global attributes** that apply to all elements.

[HTML element reference](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

This page lists all the HTML elements, which are created using tags.

[HTML attribute reference](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes)

Elements in HTML have attributes; these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.

[Global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes)

Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements.

[Content categories](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories)

Every HTML element is a member of one or more content categories â these categories group elements that share common characteristics.

[HTML comments](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Comments)

HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.

[Date and time formats used in HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats)

Certain HTML elements allow you to specify dates and/or times as the value or as the value of an attribute. These include the date and time variations of the [`<input>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element as well as the [`<ins>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins) and [`<del>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del) elements.
