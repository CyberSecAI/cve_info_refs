Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-1863:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft SharePoint not properly handling malicious JavaScript elements within a specially crafted URL, which allows the script to be displayed back to the user's browser. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how SharePoint processes list parameters in URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied data in a URL list parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated user. This could lead to the attacker performing actions with the user's permissions on the SharePoint site such as:
  - Reading content the attacker is not authorized to access.
  - Changing permissions.
  - Deleting content.
  - Injecting malicious content in the victim's browser.
- **Information Disclosure:** The injected script could potentially be used to steal sensitive information accessible to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the list parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince a user to click on the crafted URL. This can be achieved through:
    - Email Attack: Sending an email with the malicious link.
    - Web-Based Attack: Hosting the malicious link on a website, possibly a compromised one or one that accepts user content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click on the crafted URL.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to the SharePoint site in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is a "reflected" XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected and executed as part of the request/response cycle when the user clicks the URL, rather than being permanently stored on the server.
- This vulnerability is addressed by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input.
