| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=797777#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-27 09:44:25 UTC  ``` A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Kadu, the instant messenger compatible with the Gadu-Gadu protocol, performed sanitization of status and sms messages for particular contact in user's history. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted status or sms message, which would be stored in victim's Kadu history file, if the attacker was present on the contact list of the victim and the victim has had storage of statuses enabled for their history file. When the victim later examined the content of the status history, this flaw could lead to arbitrary HTML or webscript execution.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=749036>  Upstream patches: [2] <https://gitorious.org/kadu/kadu/commit/ebe3674cf0f3aa9b36308c06e19cb293cc790b52>     (patch for the XSS issue)  [3] <https://gitorious.org/kadu/kadu/commit/e9506be6d3dcdd408fdf83d8eb82416c9b798c84>     (additional hardening)  [4] <https://gitorious.org/kadu/kadu/commit/91772e46541e22cbc2c7bf41a1a9798c2a58f6d6>     (disable xhtmlrequests)  [5] <https://gitorious.org/kadu/kadu/commit/94e7479617d78a1649a0763960edade7ad09a0d0>     (allow only GET and HEADER requests, additional hardening)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=797777#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-27 10:12:24 UTC  ``` The current versions of kadu package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16 (kadu-0.6.5.4-5.fc15) are NOT affected by this issue. But in -testing repositories we already have kadu-0.10.1-2.fc16 and kadu-0.10.1-2.fc15 and particular upstream patch [2] is already applicable to these (-testing versions).  Radoslaw, when upgrading kadu versions, could you please ensure, we would upgrade to upstream versions, which already have this flaw corrected? (the latest upstream kadu version, available for download seems to be v0.11.0 from: [6] [http://www.kadu.im/w/English:Download](http://www.kadu.im/w/English%3ADownload)  and that one doesn't seem to have above patches applied yet).  So could you ensure, we would upgrade to corrected version already? (or upgrade to v0.11.0 and apply the patches above)  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=797777#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-27 10:13:59 UTC  ``` Putting into NEEDINFO due previous comment (so it won't get unnoticed).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=797777#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-27 10:16:43 UTC  ``` As of right now, it's not clear if CVE identifier has been assigned to this issue already or not. Thus asked at: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/02/27/3> to clarify this. Once CVE identifier for this issue has been allocated, this bugzilla entry will be updated with particular id.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=797777#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-29 21:33:12 UTC  ``` CVE assigned as per <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q1/518>   ``` |  |

Subject: Re: Re: CVE Status Clarification / Request -- kadu:
 Stored XSS by parsing contact's status and sms messages in history

Affected versions: 0.9.0 - 0.11.0 (0.11.1 is not vulnerable)

Vulnerability:

Any javascript code could be executed from Kadu History Window in
following conditions:
* application owner send a prepared SMS and content of this SMS was
stored in history file
* owner of application has an attacker on his buddy list, attacker
sets a prepared presence message/status description and this presence
message/status description is stored in history file

and then:

* owner of application views given SMS or presence message/status
description in history window

Javascript code was allowed to:
* load any file from WEB, by <img> or <script> tags, even <object>
with flash files were possible
* read files from local file system
* (not confirmed by myself) write files to local file system
* show javascript windows (like alert)

```

Subject: CVE Status Clarification / Request -- kadu: Stored XSS by parsing
 contact's status and sms messages in history

Hello Mariusz, Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   [1] though <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=749036#c0>
   mentions CVE identifier has been already requested for this:

   "The bug still doesn't have CVE number but will have in near future."

   it doesn't look like CVE id has been requested for this via OSS
   security list, so moving this discussion / CVE request there.

   Mariusz, could you clarify, if this issue has got a CVE identifier
   already or if we still need one? If aren't able to do so, whom
   should we contact to be clear about "CVE request status" for this?

   Or at least clarify which list that "Here is a part of massage sent
   by developers to package maintainers:" has been sent to? (so
   we could ask there)

   And in the end either use that one, already allocated or allocate
   a new one here via OSS.

   Below being issue description as I got it based on / from [2]:

   A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Kadu, the instant
messenger compatible with the Gadu-Gadu protocol, performed sanitization of
status and sms messages for particular contact in user's history. A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted status or sms message, which would
be stored in victim's Kadu history file, if the attacker was present on the
contact list of the victim and the victim has had storage of statuses enabled
for their history file. When the victim later examined the content of the
status history, this flaw could lead to arbitrary HTML or webscript execution.
