{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Kadu instant messenger application failed to properly sanitize status and SMS messages before storing them in the user's history.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that would be executed when a victim views their history. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to load external files from the web, read local files, potentially write local files, and display arbitrary JavaScript windows.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker sends a specially-crafted status or SMS message to a victim.",
        "The victim must have the attacker on their contact list.",
       "The victim must have the 'store statuses' option enabled in the history file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the victim's contact list and needs to be able to send messages/status updates to them."
  },
  "affected_versions": "Versions 0.9.0 - 0.11.0 of the Kadu instant messenger are vulnerable. Version 0.11.1 is not vulnerable.",
