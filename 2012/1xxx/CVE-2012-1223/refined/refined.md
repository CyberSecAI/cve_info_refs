{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The registered version of R2 has a telnet port active by default which uses a PIN number with a limited range, from 1 to 9999. This allows for easy brute forcing of the PIN. Once authenticated, there are vulnerabilities in the 'File' command.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack overflow vulnerability through the 'File' command.",
      "Directory traversal vulnerability exploitable through the 'File' command.",
      "PIN brute forcing due to a limited PIN range and no IP banning."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution due to the stack overflow, reading of arbitrary files via directory traversal, and unauthorized access through brute-forced PIN.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote exploitation via telnet on port 23 using specially crafted 'File' commands or brute-forcing the PIN.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send telnet commands to the target system's port 23. The attacker must first brute force the PIN, if it is not the default, which can be done easily via simple scanning of 9999 possibilities. The attacker must send a crafted 'File' command in the form 'File([filepath])'."
