Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-1963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way Mozilla Firefox's Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation generates violation reports. Specifically, it includes sensitive data within the "blocked-uri" parameter of these reports, which should not be present, according to the CSP 1.0 specification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is that CSP violation reports leak sensitive data. This data includes URL fragments and query strings from the blocked URI, even when the blocked URI has a different origin than the protected resource.
- **Violation of CSP Recommendations:**  Firefox's behavior is not compliant with CSP 1.0 recommendations, which dictates stripping the fragment and query string when the origins of protected and blocked resources differ.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **OAuth 2.0 Access Token Theft:** A malicious website can exploit this flaw to steal a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user's accounts on other services (e.g., Facebook, Google) that the user has previously authorized to access data from.
- **OpenID Credential Theft:**  Attackers can also obtain OpenID credentials, such as a user's name and email address, and signed OpenID responses. This can potentially enable them to log in as the user on other platforms.
- **Exposure of User Data:**  By acquiring the access tokens, attackers can potentially download sensitive user information from APIs of services like Facebook, Google, and others.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a website that redirects users to a trusted service's authorization endpoint (e.g., Facebook OAuth).
- **CSP Trigger:** The attacker’s website must enforce a Content Security Policy that blocks the URL that contains the sensitive data (e.g., access token).
- **Redirection to Trusted Service:** After a successful authentication at the trusted service, the victim is redirected back, with an access token in the URL’s fragment or query string.
- **CSP Violation and Data Leak:** Due to the attacker's CSP policy, Firefox generates a violation report containing the sensitive data in the `blocked-uri`, sending it to the attacker-specified `report-uri`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Hosting:** The attacker must have the capability to host a website and control its CSP policy.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting their website in the first place.
- **Target User State:** The victim must be logged into the targeted service and must have authorized a third-party service to access their data.
- **Knowledge of OAuth/OpenID Flows:**  The attacker must be familiar with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID workflows to correctly initiate the attack sequence.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report mentions that Chrome, in comparison, sends a "blocked-uri" that contains only the domain of the blocked URL, preventing the attack.
- This issue is also discussed in the context of iframe.src restrictions, where only the original source URI, not the redirection URI, is available outside the iframe.
- The fix involves stripping the fragment from both document-uri and blocked-uri, and further truncating blocked-uri to just the origin (scheme-host-port) for redirects.
- The `original-uri` is added in the redirect case to assist site administrators with tracing the blocked origin.
