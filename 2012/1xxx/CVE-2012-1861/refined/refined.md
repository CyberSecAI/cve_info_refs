      "text": "A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in SharePoint allows attacker-controlled JavaScript to run in the context of the user clicking a link. This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability as it allows an anonymous attacker to potentially issue SharePoint commands in the context of an authenticated user.\n\nTo view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see CVE-2012-1861.\n\n#### Mitigating Factors for SharePoint Script in Username Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1861\n\nMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:\n\n*   In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.\n\n#### Workarounds for SharePoint Script in Username Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1861\n\nMicrosoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n#### FAQ for SharePoint Script in Username Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1861\n\n**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**\n\nThis is a cross-site scripting vulnerability which could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure.\n\n**What causes the vulnerability?**\n\nThe vulnerability is caused when Microsoft SharePoint does not properly handle malicious JavaScript elements contained within a specially crafted URL, allowing the script to be displayed back to the user's browser.\n\n**What is cross-site scripting?**\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a website. The vulnerability can affect web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the websites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.\n\n**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim.\n\n**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**\n\nFor this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site that then displays the script back to the user's browser.\n\nIn an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted SharePoint site and by convincing the user to click the specially crafted URL.\n\nIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted SharePoint site that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convince them to click the specially crafted URL.\n\n**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**\n\nSystems where users connect to a SharePoint server, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.\n\n**What does the update do?**\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**\n\nNo. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**\n\nNo. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued."
