Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-1068:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `wp-recentcomments` WordPress plugin had a vulnerability in its `core.php` file. Specifically, the `rc_ajax()` function did not properly sanitize the `page` parameter passed through the `$_GET` request. This parameter was used directly in the `rc_get_json()` function, which could lead to an SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation. The plugin used the `$_GET['page']` variable directly, without ensuring it was an integer or otherwise safe for use in the database query within the `rc_get_json()` function.
*  **Impact:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code via the `page` parameter in a `GET` request, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to the server, specifically targeting the `rc_ajax` action and including a malicious `page` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, no authentication required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code was located in `wp-recentcomments/trunk/core.php`.
*   The `rc_ajax()` function is triggered by an AJAX request with `action=rc-ajax`.
*   The vulnerable line was: `$page = $_GET['page'];` which was changed to `$page = (int)$_GET['page'];`
*   The fix applied was to cast the `$_GET['page']` variable to an integer, mitigating the SQL injection risk.
*   The plugin was closed due to this security issue as of March 28, 2023 and is no longer available for download.
