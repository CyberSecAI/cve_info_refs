Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2012-1104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how phpCAS 1.2.2 manages the proxying of services. Specifically, a phpCAS protected application, in its default configuration, allows any other CAS service with proxy authorization and valid user credentials within the same SSO realm to proxy requests to other phpCAS applications without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Service Proxying:** The primary weakness is the lack of sufficient checks to verify if a service is authorized to act as a proxy for a user in a given application.
- **Security Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an unauthorized application to use other CAS services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access/Actions:** An attacker could potentially leverage this flaw to use CAS services in an unauthorized way by proxying their requests. This can result in bypassing intended access controls and performing actions as a valid user without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, as it involves communication between CAS services and phpCAS applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs valid user credentials within the SSO realm.
- **Proxy Authorization:** The attacker needs a CAS service with proxy authorization.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to both the vulnerable phpCAS application and the target CAS service.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The phpCAS 1.2.2 library from the jasig project is the vulnerable component.
*   **Specific Flaw:** The core of the issue lies in how phpCAS handles the proxying of services, failing to verify if one application is allowed to proxy for another.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is addressed by implementing proper checks to verify that a service is indeed authorized to proxy for users.
*   **Impacted Applications:**  Applications that embed and use the vulnerable phpCAS library for authentication may be affected such as GLPI and Moodle.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3, indicating a medium severity issue.

**Summary:**
CVE-2012-1104 highlights a security bypass vulnerability in the phpCAS library arising from improper service proxying management. This could allow an attacker with valid credentials and a proxy authorized CAS service to gain unauthorized access and perform actions on other phpCAS applications within the same SSO realm. The vulnerability has been addressed with a patch.
