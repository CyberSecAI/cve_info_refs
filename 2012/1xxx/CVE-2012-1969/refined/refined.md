{
  "CVE-2012-1969": {
    "Description": "The description of a private attachment could be visible to a user who hasn't permissions to access this attachment if the attachment ID is mentioned in a public comment in a bug that the user can see.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `get_attachment_link()` function in Bugzilla only checks if the bug itself is public or not, rather than the permissions of the user accessing the attachment description when generating a link to a private attachment description within a public comment.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthorized users can view the descriptions of private attachments if the attachment ID is mentioned in a public comment. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information that was intended to be private.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can gain access to private attachment descriptions by viewing public comments that contain the attachment ID.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to view the public comment containing a reference to a private attachment ID. No other special privileges are required."
