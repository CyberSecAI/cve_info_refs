How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: eZ Publish: insecure direct object reference

Hi,

My initial CVE ID request was dropped because it was missing some details. Here comes a re-submission.

After posting to oss-security I was asked a few questions by Kurt Seifried from Redhat SRT while the vendor was contacted by Secunia asking for pretty much the same informations. Secunia then decided it wasn't their role to handle this vulnerability.
I don't know if that's part of the process but I feel like you should know to avoid any duplicated work.

1) Email address of requester
yann.michard@...ida.fr, luc.abric@...ida.fr & jkn@...no.
Yann MICHARD discovered the vulnerability, so all the credits goes to him.

2) Software name and optionally vendor name
Vendor: Ez
Product name: Ez Publish
Editions: both Enterprise & Community

3) At least one of (to determine is this a security issue):
  1. Type of vulnerability
OWASP A4: Insecure direct object reference

  2. Exploitation vectors
Access to the vulnerable website (no need for any credentials)

  3. Attack outcome
A browser is enough to execute the attack.

4) For Open Source at least one of:
  1. Link to vulnerable source code or fix Not available yet.

  2. Link to source code change log
Not available yet.

  3. Link to security advisory
Not available yet.

  4. Link to bug entry
<http://issues.ez.no/19238>
The vendor does not want to release more details until a fix is pushed to the clients

  5. Request comes from project member (a.k.a. "trust me, it's a problem") Jostein Knudsen <jkn@...no> from Ez can confirm the vulnerability.

5) Affected version(s) (3.2.4, 3.x, current version, all current releases, something) The whole 4.x serie it seems (4.1 to 4.6 from the bug entry).

6) Whether or not this has been previously requested (i.e. on OSS-Sec or to cve-assign) Well yeah but it seems that the request didn't have enough information.

7) Is this an Open Source or commercial software request Both, the affected software has 2 editions, one open-source, one commercial.

8) Is this an embargoed issue (if yes and commercial: send to cve-assign, if yes and open source: send to vs-sec?) Not really sure what you mean by embargoed.
The French government asked us not do disclose any details until a fix is available AND installed on their systems because it affects some high profile websites.
We didn't plan on releasing any details before the fix anyway.

9) IF multiple issues are listed please list affected versions for each issue and/or who reported them (so we can determine CVE split/merge).
It's the first issue we're publishing regarding this application.
