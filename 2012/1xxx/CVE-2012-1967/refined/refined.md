  "CVE-2012-1967": {
    "description": "Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution attack using a `javascript:` URL. The Gecko engine features a JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web page. In certain cases, javascript: URLs are executed in such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient context provided to JavaScript sandbox when executing javascript: URLs, allowing scripts to escape the sandbox.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate sandboxing",
        "Improper privilege handling",
          "JavaScript sandbox escape"
