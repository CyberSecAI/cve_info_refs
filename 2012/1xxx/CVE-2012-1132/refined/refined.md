Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-1132:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read flaw located in the `parse_subrs()` function of the Type1 font loader in FreeType. This occurs when parsing specific malformed Type1 font files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The `parse_subrs()` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when handling certain malformed Type1 font files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the application that uses the vulnerable FreeType library. This is due to the out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Possible arbitrary code execution:** While most reports mention a crash, some sources also indicate a potential for arbitrary code execution with user privileges, though this is less commonly stated for this specific CVE compared to related CVEs from the same timeframe.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Specially crafted font file:** The attacker needs to provide a malformed Type1 font file that triggers the vulnerability in the `parse_subrs()` function.
- **User interaction:** A user must be tricked into using or opening the malicious font file. This could be achieved through various methods, such as embedding the font in a webpage, attaching it to an email, or providing it via a file download.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Remote attack:** An attacker can be remote.
- **Ability to craft a malformed font file:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specific Type1 font file that exploits the vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs a way to get the victim to process the crafted font file.

**Additional technical details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security Team.
- The fix for this issue involved updating FreeType to version 2.4.9, where the vulnerable code was corrected or made more robust.

**Summary of sources:**
The information above is a summary of technical details found from the following sources:
- Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1403-1.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry for Bug 800590.
- Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2012:0467
