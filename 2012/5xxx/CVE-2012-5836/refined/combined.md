## Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript

enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript

code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit

this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same

domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Thunderbird to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious E-Mail, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript

enabled, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript

code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. If JavaScript were

enabled, an attacker could use this to bypass intended chrome-only

restrictions on reading DOM object properties via a crafted web site.

([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript

enabled, a remote attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had

JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and

had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute

arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or

arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214),

[CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829), [CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840),

[CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217), [CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled,

an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830), [CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new packages introduced

regressions in cookies handling and the User Agent string. This update fixes

the problem.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:1592-1
Rating: important
References: #790140
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 for VMware
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP2

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 10.0.11 ESR
security release, which fixes various bugs and security
issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-106: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series critically
rated of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and memory
corruption issues in shipped software. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
execution. We would also like to thank miaubiz for
reporting two additional use-after-free and memory
corruption issues introduced during Firefox development
that have been fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o use-after-free when loading html file on osx
(CVE-2012-5830) o Mesa crashes on certain texImage2D calls
involving level>0 (CVE-2012-5833) o integer overflow,
invalid write w/webgl bufferdata (CVE-2012-5835)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o crash in copyTexImage2D with image dimensions
too large for given level (CVE-2012-5838)
\*
MFSA 2012-105: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer
overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped
software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting five additional
use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow
flaws introduced during Firefox development that have been
fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditorState::PrepareEditor (CVE-2012-4214) o
Heap-use-after-free in
nsPlaintextEditor::FireClipboardEvent (CVE-2012-4215) o

The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o Heap-use-after-free in XPCWrappedNative::Mark
(CVE-2012-4212) o Heap-use-after-free in
nsEditor::FindNextLeafNode (CVE-2012-4213) o
Heap-use-after-free in nsViewManager::ProcessPendingUpdates
(CVE-2012-4217) o Heap-use-after-free
BuildTextRunsScanner::BreakSink::SetBreaks (CVE-2012-4218)
\*
MFSA 2012-104 / CVE-2012-4210: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a maliciously crafted
stylesheet is inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and
CSS can run in a chrome privileged context without being
properly sanitized first. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-103 / CVE-2012-4209: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a
frame whose name attribute's value is set to "top". This
can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-102 / CVE-2012-5837: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that when script is entered into
the Developer Toolbar, it runs in a chrome privileged
context. This allows for arbitrary code execution or
cross-site scripting (XSS) if a user can be convinced to
paste malicious code into the Developer Toolbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-101 / CVE-2012-4207: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa found when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is
used for text, the "~" character will destroy another
character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in
HZ-GB-2312.
\*
MFSA 2012-100 / CVE-2012-5841: Mozilla developer
Bobby Holley reported that security wrappers filter at the
time of property access, but once a function is returned,
the caller can use this function without further security
checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for
write actions on objects when only read actions should be
properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-99 / CVE-2012-4208: Mozilla developer Peter
Van der Beken discovered that same-origin XrayWrappers
expose chrome-only properties even when not in a chrome
compartment. This can allow web content to get properties
of DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-98 / CVE-2012-4206: Security researcher
Robert Kugler reported that when a specifically named DLL
file on a Windows computer is placed in the default
downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the Firefox
installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In
circumstances where the installer is run by an
administrator privileged account, this allows for the
downloaded DLL file to be run with administrator
privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution from
a privileged account.
\*
MFSA 2012-97 / CVE-2012-4205: Mozilla developer Gabor
Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created
within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the
sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running
untrusted code in a sandbox.
\*
MFSA 2012-96 / CVE-2012-4204: Security researcher
Scott Bell of Security-Assessment.com used the Address
Sanitizer tool to discover a memory corruption in
str\_unescape in the Javascript engine. This could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-95 / CVE-2012-4203: Security researcher
kakzz.ng@gmail.com reported that if a javascript: URL is
selected from the list of Firefox "new tab" page, the
script will inherit the privileges of the privileged "new
tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally
installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a
bookmark of a malicious javascript: URL.
\*
MFSA 2012-94 / CVE-2012-5836: Security researcher
Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining SVG text on a
path with the setting of CSS properties could lead to a
potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-93 / CVE-2012-4201: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that if code executed by
the evalInSandbox function sets location.href, it can get
the wrong subject principal for the URL check, ignoring the
sandbox's Javascript context and gaining the context of
evalInSandbox object. This can lead to malicious web
content being able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack or stealing a copy of a local file if the user has
installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-92 / CVE-2012-4202: Security researcher
Atte Kettunen from OUSPG used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format
images. This issue is potentially exploitable and could
lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-91: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [ubufox](/security/cves?package=ubufox) - Ubuntu Firefox specific configuration defaults and apt support

## Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides an

updated ubufox package for use with the latest Firefox.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86\_64; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0.1
Build ID: 20120908010631
Steps to reproduce:
Start with SVG with text on a path. Make sure there is an earlier sibling in the svg's parent element. Set a parent container to have a relative position. Firefox crashes.
Pull up the attached html file and click "Crash Firefox" to reproduce it.
Actual results:
Firefox crashes. A cursory look in gdb indicates it's somewhere deep in the xul libraries.
Reproduced on Firefox 15.0.1 Linux and Mac and Firefox 16b3 Linux.
Expected results:
The style should be set correctly and Firefox does not crash.

roc, it would be great to have your thoughts on how best to fix this issue.
longsonr: I have two reservations about this patch. The first is that observing frames are going to be left with the wrong bounds and overflow regions if we don't call InvalidateAndScheduleReflowSVG. The second is that, while this patch may prevent the crash at hand, it's not clear to me that we don't have other ways that we end up in code that pokes around the frame tree under the nsSVGEffects::InvalidateDirectRenderingObservers call in nsFrame::DestroyFrom. (Or that we won't accidentally introduce such code in future.)
I wonder if the best way to fix this is to delay the nsSVGEffects::InvalidateDirectRenderingObservers call in nsFrame::DestroyFrom, similar to the way that Mats' patch in [bug 789719](/show_bug.cgi?id=789719 "VERIFIED FIXED - Frame Poison Crash [@ nsLineBox::IndexOf ] | [@ nsIFrame::GetNextSibling() ] during reflow") delays the FrameNeedsReflow call. You could create an nsInvalidateDirectRenderingObserversRunable similar to nsReflowFrameRunnable and, if the frame has rendering observers, pass one of those containing the observer list to nsContentUtils::AddScriptRunner. Better still you could wrap that up in a helper function that makes sure we only ever have one such runable pending, and that we just maintain a hash of weak pointers to observer frames.

Probably a bit late at night for me to be thinking out loud, but here goes...
It's not ideal that we need to call ReflowSVG() on rendering observers in the first place. Ideally we'd only need to call UpdateOverflow() on them. (Although I'm not sure how much safer scheduling a restyle is to scheduling a reflow.)
There seem to be two places where rendering observers need the ReflowSVG. nsSVGPathGeometryFrame needs it because markers are currently included in the mRect, but I can't offhand see a reason why we need that to be the case (just including them in the visual overflow rect would seem to be fine). nsSVGTextFrame also needs a ReflowSVG because the offsets of the children frames' mRects depend on their textPath. That would seem to be harder to eliminate, and would be annoying to have to do given heycam's text rewrite.
Maybe for branches we can do some sort of script blocker thing, and for trunk we can investigate whether we can get rid of that by eliminating the need for rendering observer invalidation to include ReflowSVG() calls?

... and on their ancestors as far as it results in a change, and then
you might bump in to a scroll frame where UpdateOverflow() can in the
worst case result in a reflow currently:

I agree, some kind of async approach is a more robust long term solution.

Okay, I'll have a go at implementing something along the lines of the fix described in the last paragraph of [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=792857#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - SVG text on path + setting a style crashes Firefox"), unless you want to do it, Mats.

(I think he was asking about ESR10, which IIRC we'll continue to support for a bit after ESR17 is released. So -- [Comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=792857#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - SVG text on path + setting a style crashes Firefox") & 27 answered his question. Setting status-firefox-esr10 to "unaffected" based on those comments.)

It's sufficient to resolve the bug, but we still need to know what fixed it to know whether it's merely masked and might come back or whether it's really dead.Flags: needinfo?(mwobensmith)Keywords: [qawanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=qawanted&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [adv-track-main17+][adv-track-esr17+] → [adv-track-main17+][adv-track-esr17+] fix-range-wanted

I'm not the Dan you were directing the question to, but I think any of {nightly, aurora, beta} would do.
In each of those branches, [bug 779971](/show_bug.cgi?id=779971 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: Must not call under nsISVGChildFrame::ReflowSVG\"") landed after the build that you mentioned in [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=792857#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - SVG text on path + setting a style crashes Firefox"), so it definitely wasn't what fixed it. (and we want to find out what \_did\_ fix it)

It will be <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/9edabc0ddc99> this is the one that allows us to traverse a frame tree during frame destruction.
[bug 779971](/show_bug.cgi?id=779971 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: Must not call under nsISVGChildFrame::ReflowSVG\"") stops us traversing the frame tree during frame destruction with textPaths.
Having either [bug 779971](/show_bug.cgi?id=779971 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: Must not call under nsISVGChildFrame::ReflowSVG\"") or [bug 786740](/show_bug.cgi?id=786740 "VERIFIED FIXED - CSS transition with rounded borders cause rendering issues") would fix this issue and 17, 18, trunk all have both now.

Thanks Matt, that still includes the full PGO merge. I don't think we can realistically narrow this down any further. I think we proceed based on Robert's [comment 37](/show_bug.cgi?id=792857#c37 "VERIFIED FIXED - SVG text on path + setting a style crashes Firefox").
dveditz, does this satisfy your qawanted request? If not, please advise how we can break this down further.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
