Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by combining SVG text on a path with the setting of CSS properties. This combination leads to a crash due to issues in how Firefox handles the interaction between these elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness lies in improper handling of SVG text paths and CSS property settings, leading to memory corruption and subsequent crashes. The root cause seems to be in the frame traversal logic during frame destruction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could cause Firefox, Thunderbird, or SeaMonkey to crash, leading to denial of service. This could be achieved if a user is tricked into opening a malicious webpage or email containing the crafted SVG/CSS combination.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The crash could potentially be exploitable to achieve arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly verified in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malicious web pages or emails crafted to include specific SVG elements with corresponding CSS properties, designed to trigger the vulnerability in Firefox, Thunderbird, or SeaMonkey.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a specific combination of SVG text on a path and CSS properties.
- The attacker would need to entice the user to open a malicious web page in Firefox, or email in Thunderbird or SeaMonkey.
- No specific privilege or network position is required beyond having a user open the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Jonathan Stephens.
- This vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 17, SeaMonkey 2.14, and Thunderbird 17.
- The vulnerability was addressed by changes related to how frames are traversed during destruction. The fix in [bug 786740](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=786740) appears to be the primary fix.
- The bug is classified as a "defect" with "critical" severity and was tracked under "sec-critical".
- The issue is not directly exploitable in the email contexts of Thunderbird and SeaMonkey due to disabled scripting by default, but exists in browser-like contexts of those products.
