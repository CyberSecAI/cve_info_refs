  "CVE-2012-5129": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that Mesa incorrectly handled certain arrays. An attacker could use this issue to cause Mesa to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Mesa incorrectly handled certain arrays, leading to a heap buffer overflow in the GPU process when using WebGL.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service or possible arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing specially crafted data with Mesa, specifically through WebGL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted data that will be processed by Mesa, such as via a malicious website using WebGL."
