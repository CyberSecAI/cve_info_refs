 [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/cmp\_configuration/guide/sup2T\_10GEcmp.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/cmp_configuration/guide/sup2T_10GEcmp.html)

Supervisor Engine 2T-10GE Restrictions

* The 1-Gigabit Ethernet ports and the 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports have the same QoS port architecture (**2q4t** / **1p3q4t**) unless you disable the 1-Gigabit Ethernet ports with the  **platform qos 10g-only** global configuration command. With the 1-Gigabit Ethernet ports disabled, the QoS port architecture of the 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports is  **8q4t** / **1p7q4t**.
* In RPR redundancy mode, the ports on a Supervisor Engine 2T-10GE in standby mode are disabled.

### Policy Feature Cards

* [Policy Feature Card Guidelines and Restrictions](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SY/release/notes/ol_20679.html#16488)
* [Policy Feature Card 4XL](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SY/release/notes/ol_20679.html#46275)
* [Policy Feature Card 4](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SY/release/notes/ol_20679.html#58281)

### Policy Feature Card Guidelines and Restrictions

* The PFC4 supports a theoretical maximum of 131,072 (128K) MAC addresses with 118,000 (115.2K) MAC addresses as the recommended maximum.
* The PFC4 partitions the hardware FIB table to route IPv4 unicast, IPv4 multicast, MPLS, and IPv6 unicast and multicast traffic in hardware. Traffic for routes that do not have entries in the hardware FIB table are processed by the route processor in software.

The defaults for  [XL mode](ol_20679.html#PFC4XL_mode) are:

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IPv4 unicast and MPLS: 512,000 routes

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IPv4 multicast and IPv6 unicast and multicast: 256,000 routes

The defaults for  [Non-XL mode](ol_20679.html#PFC4_mode) are:

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IPv4 unicast and MPLS: 192,000 routes

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IPv4 multicast and IPv6 unicast and multicast: 32,000 routes

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The size of the global internet routing table plus any local routes might exceed the non-XL mode default partition sizes.

---

These are the theoretical maximum numbers of routes for the supported protocols (the maximums are not supported simultaneously):

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)  [XL mode](ol_20679.html#PFC4XL_mode) :

‚Ä¢ IPv4 and MPLS: Up to 1,007,000 routes

‚Ä¢ IPv4 multicast and IPv6 unicast and multicast: Up to 503,000 routes

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)  [Non-XL mode](ol_20679.html#PFC4_mode) :

‚Ä¢ IPv4 and MPLS: Up to 239,000 routes

‚Ä¢ IPv4 multicast and IPv6 unicast and multicast: Up to 119,000 routes

Enter the  **platform cef maximum-routes** command to repartition the hardware FIB table. IPv4 unicast and MPLS require one hardware FIB table entry per route. IPv4 multicast and IPv6 unicast and multicast require two hardware FIB table entries per route. Changing the partition for one protocol makes corresponding changes in the partitions of the other protocols. You must enter the  **reload** command to put configuration changes made with the  **platform cef maximum-routes** command into effect.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) With a non-XL-mode system, if your requirements cannot be met by repartitioning the hardware FIB table, upgrade components as necessary to operate in XL mode.

---

* You cannot use one type of PFC on one supervisor engine and a different type on the other supervisor engine for redundancy. You must use identical policy feature cards for redundancy.
* PFC4‚ÄîThese restrictions apply to a configuration with a PFC4 and these DFCs:

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PFC4 and DFC4‚ÄîNo restrictions (PFC4 mode).

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PFC4 and DFC4XL‚ÄîThe PFC4 restricts DFC4XL functionality: the DFC4XL functions as a DFC4 (PFC4 mode).

* PFC4XL‚ÄîThese restrictions apply to a configuration with a PFC4XL and these DFCs:

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PFC4XL and DFC4‚ÄîPFC4XL functionality is restricted by the DFC4: after a reload with a DFC4-equipped module installed, the PFC4XL functions as a PFC4 (PFC4 mode).

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PFC4XL and DFC4XL‚ÄîNo restrictions (PFC4XL mode).

* Switching modules that you install after bootup that are equipped with a DFC that imposes a more restricted PFC mode than the current PFC mode remain powered down.
* You must reboot to use a switching module equipped with a DFC that imposes a more restricted PFC mode than the current PFC mode.

 [http://www.cisco.com/web/about/doing\_business/legal/global\_export\_trade/general\_export/contract\_compliance.html](//www.cisco.com/web/about/doing_business/legal/global_export_trade/general_export/contract_compliance.html)

## Universal Boot Loader Image

The Universal Boot Loader (UBL) image is a minimal network-aware image that can download and install a Cisco IOS image from a running active supervisor engine in the same chassis. When newly installed as a standby supervisor engine in a redundant configuration, a supervisor engine running the UBL image automatically attempts to copy the image of the running active supervisor engine in the same chassis.

### New Software Features in Release 12.2(50)SY

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) On Sup2T (EARL8) new MAC learns for routed frames may not immediately be synced across all DFCs. When New MAC learns for routed frames, no FF is created. As a result, the MAC table between DFCs in the system may be out of sync until software synchronization performs an update (approximately 160 seconds). As a workaround, "platform mac address-table synchronize learn layer3" was added to enable Supervisor2T to learn new MACs (and MAC moves) on routed traffic. This command is disabled by default.

It also allows users to remotely subscribe and unsubscribe from multicast groups. The IGMP MIB Support Enhancements for SNMP feature adds full support of RFC 2933 (Internet Group Management Protocol MIB) in Cisco IOS software. There are no new or modified Cisco IOS commands associated with this feature. For complete details on the IGMP MIB, see this publication:

 **Symptoms:**  Memory increase occurs in ‚ÄòBGP Router‚Äô process due to BGP path attributes. Memory used by this process increases constantly and so do the BGP path attributes while the number of routes does not increase.

 **Conditions:**  This issue occurs with continuous churn in the network such that BGP never manages to converge and when the paths churning do not reuse the existing path attributes. This cause those paths to allocate new path attributes.

 **Workaround:**  Reload the router if low memory conditions are reached or identify the root cause of the churn and attempt to fix that.

 **Further Problem Description:** Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust the memory of an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to BGP code, when processing BGP path attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing path instability in the BGP environment. An exploit could allow the attacker to deplete the memory of the affected device.

 **PSIRT Evaluation:** The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 4.3/3.6:  <https://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvssCalculator.do?dispatch=1&version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C>

The server side of the Secure Copy (SCP) implementation in Cisco IOS software contains a vulnerability that could allow authenticated users with an attached command-line interface (CLI) view to transfer files to and from a Cisco IOS device that is configured to be an SCP server, regardless of what users are authorized to do, per the CLI view configuration. This vulnerability could allow valid users to retrieve or write to any file on the device‚Äôs file system, including the device‚Äôs saved configuration and Cisco IOS image files, even if the CLI view attached to the user does not allow it. This configuration file may include passwords or other sensitive information.

The Cisco IOS SCP server is an optional service that is disabled by default. CLI views are a fundamental component of the Cisco IOS Role-Based CLI Access feature, which is also disabled by default. Devices that are not specifically configured to enable the Cisco IOS SCP server, or that are configured to use it but do not use role-based CLI access, are not affected by this vulnerability.

This vulnerability does not apply to the Cisco IOS SCP client feature.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.

There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability apart from disabling either the SCP server or the CLI view feature if these services are not required by administrators.

 **Symptoms:**  A privilege level 1 user is able to log in with a higher privilege level.

 **Conditions:**  This symptom is observed on a Cisco platform when the  **aaa new-model** command is enabled, when the  **privilege level**  *level* command is present under the vty lines, and when the  *level* argument has any value from 2 through 15.

 **Workaround:**  Do not configure privilege level 1 but configure any other privilege level.

* [CSCsv73509](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCsv73509) ‚ÄîResolved in 12.2(50)SY

 **Symptoms:**  When  **no aaa new-model** is configured, authentication happens through the local even when tacacs is configured. This happens for the exec users under vty configuration.

 **Conditions:**  Configure  **no aaa new-model**, configure  **login local** under  **line vty 0 4** and configure  **login tacacs** under  **line vty 0 4**.

 **Workaround:**  There is no workaround.

* [CSCsa43465](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCsa43465) ‚ÄîResolved in 12.2(50)SY

 **Symptoms:**  Users may be able to access root view mode (privilege level) 15 without entering a password.

 **Conditions:**  This symptom is observed on a Cisco router that has the Role-Based CLI Access feature enabled and occurs when the  **none** keyword is enabled in the default login method list.

For example, the symptom may occur when you enter the  **aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ none**. When the TACACS+ server is down, users are allowed to enter non-privileged mode. However, users can also access the root view through the  **enable view** command without having to enter a password.

 **Workaround:**  Ensure that the  **none** keyword is not part of the default login method list.

 **Further Problem Description:** The fix for this caveat places the authentication of the  **enable view** command in the default login method list.

* [CSCsg88561](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCsg88561) ‚ÄîResolved in 12.2(50)SY

 **Symptom:** When accessing VTY lines configured for TACACS AAA authentication, the remote access session will not get access to the device.

 **Conditions:** If using TACACS for VTY user authentication the remote access session will stop being processed after the username and password have been entered. Operation of the device continues as per normal, just the remote VTY session can not be used.

Limited to C7600 ONLY.

 **Workaround:** Local Authentication or RADIUS could be used as a workaround.

This advisory is posted at  [http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20080924-vpn](//tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20080924-vpn)

Recent research (1) has shown that it is possible to cause BGP sessions to remotely reset by injecting invalid data, specifically AS\_CONFED\_SEQUENCE data, into the AS4\_PATH attribute provided to store 4-byte ASN paths. Since AS4\_PATH is an optional transitive attribute, the invalid data will be transited through many intermediate ASes which will not examine the content. For this bug to be triggered, an operator does not have to be actively using 4-byte AS support.

The root cause of this problem is the Cisco implementation of RFC 4893 (4-byte ASN support) - this RFC states that AS\_CONFED\_SEQUENCE data in the AS4\_PATH attribute is invalid. However, it does not explicitely state what to do if such invalid data is received, so the Cisco implemention of this RFC sends a BGP NOTIFICATION message to the peer and the BGP session is terminated.

RFC 4893 is in the process of getting updated to avoid this problem, and the fix for this bug implements the proposed change. The proposed change is as follows:

‚ÄúTo prevent the possible propagation of confederation path segments outside of a confederation, the path segment types AS\_CONFED\_SEQUENCE and AS\_CONFED\_SET [RFC5065] are declared invalid for the AS4\_PATH attribute. A NEW BGP speaker MUST NOT send these path segment types in the AS4\_PATH attribute of an UPDATE message. A NEW BGP speaker that receives these path segment types in the AS4\_PATH attribute of an UPDATE message MUST discard these path segments, adjust the relevant attribute fields accordingly, and continue processing the UPDATE message.‚Äù

The only affected version of Cisco IOS that supports RFC 4893 is 12.0(32)S12, released in December 2008.

* [CSCsx73770](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCsx73770) ‚ÄîResolved in 12.2(50)SY

 **Symptom:** A Cisco IOS device that receives a BGP update message and as a result of AS prepending needs to send an update downstream that would have over 255 AS hops will send an invalid formatted update. This update when received by a downstream BGP speaker triggers a NOTIFICATION back to the sender which results in the BGP session being reset.

 **Conditions:** This problem is seen when a Cisco IOS device receives a BGP update and due to a combination of either inbound, outbound, or both AS prepending it needs to send an update downstream that has more than 255 AS hops.

 **Workaround:** The workaround is to implement  **bgp maxas-limit X**  on the device that after prepending would need to send an update with over 255 AS hops. Since IOS limits the route-map prepending value to 10 the most that could be added is 21 AS hops (10 on ingress, 10 on egress, and 1 for normal eBGP AS hop addition). Therefore, a conservative value to configure would be 200 to prevent this condition.

Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software support RFC4893 (‚ÄúBGP Support for Four-octet AS Number Space‚Äù) and contain two remote denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities when handling specific Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) updates.

These vulnerabilities affect only devices running Cisco IOS Software with support for four-octet AS number space (here after referred to as 4-byte AS number) and BGP routing configured.

The first vulnerability could cause an affected device to reload when processing a BGP update that contains autonomous system (AS) path segments made up of more than one thousand autonomous systems.

The second vulnerability could cause an affected device to reload when the affected device processes a malformed BGP update that has been crafted to trigger the issue.

Cisco has released free software updates to address these vulnerabilities.

No workarounds are available for the first vulnerability.

A workaround is available for the second vulnerability.

* [CSCek49649](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCek49649) ‚ÄîResolved in 12.2(50)SY

 **Symptoms:**  Cisco Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7600 modules are reachable via 127.0.0.x addresses.

 **Conditions:**  Cisco Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7600 series devices use addresses from the 127.0.0.0/8 (loopback) range in the Ethernet Out-of-Band Channel (EOBC) for internal communication.

Addresses from this range that are used in the EOBC on Cisco Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7600 series devices are accessible from outside of the system. The Supervisor module, Multilayer Switch Feature Card (MSFC), or any other intelligent module may receive and process packets that are destined for the 127.0.0.0/8 network. An attacker can exploit this behavior to bypass existing access control lists; however, an exploit will not allow an attacker to bypass authentication or authorization. Valid authentication credentials are still required to access the module in question.

Per RFC 3330, a packet that is sent to an address anywhere within the 127.0.0.0/8 address range should loop back inside the host and should never reach the physical network. However, some host implementations send packets to addresses in the 127.0.0.0/8 range outside their Network Interface Card (NIC) and to the network. Certain implementations that normally do not send packets to addresses in the 127.0.0.0/8 range may also be configured to do so..

Destination addresses in the 127.0.0.0/8 range are not routed on the Internet. This factor limits the exposure of this issue.

This issue is applicable to systems that run Hybrid Mode (Catalyst OS (CatOS) software on the Supervisor Engine and IOS Software on the MSFC) and Native Mode (IOS Software on both the Supervisor Engine and the MSFC).

 **Workaround:**  Administrators can apply an access control list that filters packets to the 127.0.0.0/8 address range to interfaces where attacks may be launched.

Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block traffic with a destination IP address in the 127.0.0.0/8 address range sent to the device. Cisco IOS Software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks. CoPP protects the management and control planes by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations.

 **Symptom:** The Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server provide web server functionality to be used by other Cisco IOS features that require it to function. For example, embedded device managers available for some Cisco IOS devices need the Cisco IOS HTTP server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server to be enabled as a prerequisite.

One of the functionalities provided by the Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server is the WEB\_EXEC module, which is the HTTP-based IOS EXEC Server. The WEB\_EXEC module allows for both ‚Äúshow‚Äù and ‚Äúconfigure‚Äù commands to be executed on the device through requests sent over the HTTP protocol.

Both the Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server use the locally configured enable password (configured by using the  **enable password** or  **enable secret** commands) as the default authentication mechanism for any request received. Other mechanisms can also be configured to authenticate requests to the HTTP or HTTPS interface. Some of those mechanisms are the local user database, an external RADIUS server or an external TACACS+ server.

If an enable password is not present in the device configuration, and no other mechanism has been configured to authenticate requests to the HTTP interface, the Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server may execute any command received without requiring authentication. Any commands up to and including commands that require privilege level 15 might then be executed on the device. Privilege level 15 is the highest privilege level on Cisco IOS devices.

 **Conditions:** For a Cisco IOS device to be affected by this issue all of the following conditions must be met:

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) An enable password is not present in the device configuration

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Either the Cisco IOS HTTP server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server is enabled

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) No other authentication mechanism has been configured for access to the Cisco IOS HTTP server or Cisco IOS HTTPS server. Such mechanisms might include the local user database, RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service), or TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System)

The Cisco IOS HTTP server is enabled by default on some Cisco IOS releases.

 **Workaround:** Any of the following workarounds can be implementd:

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enabling authentication of requests to the Cisco IOS HTTP Server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server by configuring an enable password

Customers requiring the functionality provided by the Cisco IOS HTTP server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server must configure an authentication mechanism for any requests received. One option is to use the  **enable password** or  **enable secret** commands to configure an enable password. The enable password is the default authentication mechanism used by both the Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server if no other method has been configured.

In order to configure an enable password by using the  **enable secret** command, add the following line to the device configuration:

 **enable secret**  *mypassword*

Replace  *mypassword* with a strong password of your choosing. For guidance on selecting strong passwords, please refer to your site security policy. The document entitled ‚ÄúCisco IOS Password Encryption Facts‚Äù explains the differences between using the  **enable secret** and the  **enable password** commands to configure an enable password. This document is available at the following link:  [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk59/technologies\_tech\_note09186a00809d38a7.shtml](//www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk59/technologies_tech_note09186a00809d38a7.shtml)

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enabling authentication of requests to the Cisco IOS HTTP Server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server by configuring an authentication mechanism other than the default

Configure an authentication mechanism for access to the Cisco IOS HTTP server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server other than the default. Such authentication mechanism can be the local user database, an external RADIUS server, an external TACACS+ server or a previously defined AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) method. As the procedure to enable an authentication mechanism for the Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server varies across Cisco IOS releases and considering other additional factors, no example will be provided. Customers looking for information about how to configure an authentication mechanism for the Cisco IOS HTTP server and for the Cisco IOS HTTPS server are encouraged to read the document entitled ‚ÄúAAA Control of the IOS HTTP Server‚Äù, which is available at the following link:  [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk59/technologies\_tech\_note09186a008069bdc5.shtml](//www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk59/technologies_tech_note09186a008069bdc5.shtml)

‚Äì![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disabling the Cisco IOS HTTP Server and/or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server functionality

Customers who do not require the functionality provided by the Cisco IOS HTTP server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server can disable it by adding the following commands to the device configuration:

 **no ip http server**  **no ip http secure-server**

The second command might return an error message if the Cisco IOS version installed and running on the device does not support the HTTPS server feature. This error message is harmless and can safely be ignored.

Please be aware that disabling the Cisco IOS HTTP server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server may impact other features that rely on it. As an example, disabling the Cisco IOS HTTP server or the Cisco IOS HTTPS server will disable access to any embedded device manager installed on the device.

 **Further Problem Description:** In addition to the explicit workarounds detailed above it is highly recommended that customers limit access to Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server to only trusted management hosts. Information on how to restrict access to the Cisco IOS HTTP server and the Cisco IOS HTTPS server based on IP addresses is available at the following link:  [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/https/configuration/12-4/nm-http-web.html#GUID-BB57C0D5-71DB-47C5-9C11-8146773D1127](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/https/configuration/12-4/nm-http-web.html#GUID-BB57C0D5-71DB-47C5-9C11-8146773D1127)

Cisco IOS devices that are configured for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol and certificate based authentication are vulnerable to a resource exhaustion attack. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in the allocation of all available Phase 1 security associations (SA) and prevent the establishment of new IPsec sessions.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.

 **Symptoms:**  A device that is running Cisco IOS software may crash during processing of an Internet Key Exchange (IKE) message.

 **Conditions:**  The device must have a valid and complete configuration for IPsec. IPsec VPN features in Cisco IOS software that use IKE include Site-to- Site VPN tunnels, EzVPN (server and remote), DMVPN, IPsec over GRE, and GET VPN.

 **Workaround:**  Customers that do not require IPsec functionality on their devices can use the  **no crypto isakmp enable** command in global configuration mode to disable the processing of IKE messages and eliminate device exposure.

If IPsec is configured, this bug may be mitigated by applying access control lists that limit the hosts or IP networks that are allowed to establish IPsec sessions with affected devices. This assumes that IPsec peers are known. This workaround may not be feasible for remote access VPN gateways where the source IP addresses of VPN clients are not known in advance. ISAKMP uses port UDP/500 and can also use UDP/848 (the GDOI port) when GDOI is in use.

 **Further Problem Description:** This bug is triggered deep into the IKE negotiation, and an exchange of messages between IKE peers is necessary.

If IPsec is not configured, it is not possible to reach the point in the IKE negotiation where the bug exists.

 **Symptoms:** After launching a flood of random IPv6 router advertisements when an interface is configured with ‚Äúipv6 address autoconf‚Äù, removing the IPv6 configuration on the interface with ‚Äúno ipv6 address autoconf‚Äù may cause a reload. Other system instabilities are also possible during and after the flood of random IPv6 router advertisements.

 **Conditions:** Cisco IOS is configured with ‚Äúipv6 address autoconf‚Äù.

 **Workarounds:** Not using IPv6 auto-configuration may be used as a workaround.

 **Further Information:** Cisco IOS checks for the hop limit field in incoming Neighbour Discovery messages and packets received with a hop limit not equal to 255 are discarded. This means that the flood of ND messages has to come from a host that is directly connected to the Cisco IOS device.

 **PSIRT Evaluation:** The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 6.1/5.5:

 **Symptom:** A Cisco router configured for multicast VPN may reload after receiving a malformed MDT data group join packet.

 **Conditions:** Affects all IOS versions that support mVPN MDT.

 **Workaround:** Filter out MDT Data Join messages from the router sending the malformed packet using a Receive Access Control List (rACL) feature. Note by doing this, the offending router will not be able to participate within the mVPN data trees.

The following example shows how to block malformed MDT Data Join messages that are sent from the device‚Äôs IP addresses using a receive ACL:

!

ip receive access-list 111

!

access-list 111 deny udp host <ip address of router sending malformed join

request> host 224.0.0.13 eq 3232

access-list 111 permit ip any any

!

 **Note:**  Ensure that the rACL does not filter critical traffic such as routing protocols or interactive access to the routers. Filtering necessary traffic could result in an inability to remotely access the router, thus requiring a console connection. For this reason, lab configurations should mimic the actual deployment as closely as possible.

As always, Cisco recommends that you test this feature in the lab prior to deployment. For more information on rACLs, refer to ‚ÄúProtecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists‚Äù at

A device running Cisco IOS software that has Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) enabled may be subject to a denial of service (DoS) attack. For the device to be affected by this vulnerability the device also has to have certain Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) User Datagram Protocol (UDP) services enabled. To exploit this vulnerability an offending IPv6 packet must be targeted to the device. Packets that are routed throughout the router can not trigger this vulnerability. Successful exploitation will prevent the interface from receiving any additional traffic. The only exception is Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) service, which if exploited, will cause the device to crash. Only the interface on which the vulnerability was exploited will be affected.

 **Symptom:**  Using scripts to access a Cisco IOS device may bypass the command authorization feature.

 **Conditions:**  AAA is configured

 **Workarounds:**  None

 **Symptoms:**  Devices running Cisco IOS may reload with the error message ‚ÄúSystem returned to ROM by abort at PC 0x0‚Äù when processing SSHv2 sessions. A switch crashes. We have a script running that will continuously ssh-v2 into the 3560 then close the session normally. If the vty line that is being used by SSHv2 sessions to the device is cleared while the SSH session is being processed, the next time an ssh into the device is done, the device will crash.

 **Conditions:**  This problem is platform independent, but it has been seen on Cisco Catalyst 3560, Cisco Catalyst 3750 and Cisco Catalyst 4948 series switches. The issue is specific to SSH version 2, and its seen only when the box is under brute force attack. This crash is not seen under normal conditions.

 **Workaround:**  There are mitigations to this vulnerability: For Cisco IOS, the SSH server can be disabled by applying the command  **crypto key zeroize rsa** while in configuration mode. The SSH server is enabled automatically upon generating an RSA key pair. Zeroing the RSA keys is the only way to completely disable the SSH server.

Access to the SSH server on Cisco IOS may also be disabled via removing SSH as a valid transport protocol. This can be done by reapplying the  **transport input** command with ‚Äòssh‚Äô removed from the list of permitted transports on VTY lines while in configuration mode. For example:  **line vty 0 4 transport input telnet end**

If SSH server functionality is desired, access to the server can be restricted to specific source IP addresses or blocked entirely using Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the VTY lines as shown in the following URL:

Multiple Cisco products are affected by denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities that manipulate the state of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections. By manipulating the state of a TCP connection, an attacker could force the TCP connection to remain in a long-lived state, possibly indefinitely. If enough TCP connections are forced into a long-lived or indefinite state, resources on a system under attack may be consumed, preventing new TCP connections from being accepted. In some cases, a system reboot may be necessary to recover normal system operation. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to complete a TCP three-way handshake with a vulnerable system.

In addition to these vulnerabilities, Cisco Nexus 5000 devices contain a TCP DoS vulnerability that may result in a system crash. This additional vulnerability was found as a result of testing the TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released free software updates for download from the Cisco website that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

 **Symptoms:**  The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM), formerly known as BGP TTL Security Hack (BTSH), checks the time-to-live (TTL) value of the packets at the application level, which is not efficient. Also, GTSM does not stop the establishment of a TCP connection for a packet with an invalid TTL value.

 **Symptom:** On routers that are configured for WCCP, interfaces that are connected to the content engine can become locked. By locked what is meant is that the interface driver is in a state where the physical interface will stop sending and receiving packets.

 **Conditions:** This issue has been introduced by  [CSCuk61396](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCuk61396), only the images that have the fix for  [CSCuk61396](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCuk61396) are affected by this issue.

 **Workaround:** There are no workarounds. If an interface becomes locked, the only way to recover the system is to do a reload.

* [Additional Troubleshooting Information](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SY/release/notes/ol_20679.html#27282)

### System Troubleshooting

This section contains troubleshooting guidelines for system-level problems:

* When the system is booting and running power-on diagnostics, do not reset the switch.
* After you initiate a switchover from the active supervisor engine to the redundant supervisor engine, or when you insert a redundant supervisor engine in an operating switch, always wait until the supervisor engines have synchronized and all modules are online before you remove or insert modules or supervisor engines or perform another switchover.
* If you have an interface whose speed is set to  **auto** connected to another interface whose speed is set to a fixed value, configure the interface whose speed is set to a fixed value for half duplex. Alternately, you can configure both interfaces to a fixed-value speed and full duplex.
* If you apply both ACL and FnF with sampler on the SVI interface, the operational state of the Feature Manager gets reduced which causes the traffic to get software switched. In this state, if incoming traffic rate is high, CPU utilization will also go high. Therefore, apply ACL and FnF without sampler on the SVI interface. Otherwise, apply ACL and FnF with sampler on the physical interface.

### Module Troubleshooting

This section contains troubleshooting guidelines for module problems:

* When you hot insert a module into a chassis, be sure to use the ejector levers on the front of the module to seat the backplane pins properly. Inserting a module without using the ejector levers might cause the supervisor engine to display incorrect messages about the module. For module installation instructions, refer to the  *Catalyst 6500 Series Module Installation Guide*.
* Whenever you connect an interface that has duplex set to autonegotiate to an end station or another networking device, make sure that the other device is configured for autonegotiation as well. If the other device is not set to autonegotiate, the autonegotiating port will remain in half-duplex mode, which can cause a duplex mismatch resulting in packet loss, late collisions, and line errors on the link.

### VLAN Troubleshooting

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Catalyst 6500 series switches do not support ISL-encapsulated Token Ring frames. To support trunked Token Ring traffic in your network, make trunk connections directly between switches that support ISL-encapsulated Token Ring frames. When a Catalyst 6500 series switch is configured as a VTP server, you can configure Token Ring VLANs from the switch.

---

Although DTP is a point-to-point protocol, some internetworking devices might forward DTP frames. To avoid connectivity problems that might be caused by a switch acting on these forwarded DTP frames, do the following:

* For interfaces connected to devices that do not support DTP, in which trunking is not currently being used, configure interfaces with the  **switchport mode access** command, which puts the interface into access mode and sends no DTP frames.
* When manually enabling trunking on a link to devices that do not support DTP, use the  **switchport nonegotiate** and  **switchport mode trunk** commands, which puts the interface into trunking mode without sending DTP frames.

### Spanning Tree Troubleshooting

The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) blocks certain ports to prevent physical loops in a redundant topology. On a blocked port, switches receive spanning tree bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) periodically from neighboring switches. You can configure the frequency with which BPDUs are received by entering the  **spanning-tree vlan**   *vlan\_ID*  **hello-time** command (the default frequency is set to 2 seconds). If a switch does not receive a BPDU in the time period defined by the  **spanning-tree vlan**  *vlan\_ID*  **max-age** command (20 seconds by default), the blocked port transitions to the listening state, the learning state, and to the forwarding state. As it transitions, the switch waits for the time period specified by the  **spanning-tree vlan**   *vlan\_ID*  **forward-time** command (15 seconds by default) in each of these intermediate states. If a blocked spanning tree interface does not receive BPDUs from its neighbor within 50 seconds, it moves into the forwarding state.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) We do not recommend using the UplinkFast feature on switches with more than 20 active VLANs. The convergence time might be unacceptably long with more than 20 active VLANs.

---

To debug STP problems, follow these guidelines:

* The  **show vlan virtual-port** command displays the number of virtual interfaces.
* These maximum numbers of virtual interfaces are supported:

|  | MST | RPVST+ | PVST+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Per-switch limits: | 100,000 total | 12,000 total | 15,000 total |

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS software displays a message if you exceed the maximum number of virtual interfaces.

---

* After a switchover from the active to the redundant supervisor engine, the ports on the redundant supervisor engine take longer to come up than other ports.
* Record all spanning tree-blocked ports in each switch in your network. For each of the spanning tree-blocked ports, record the output of the  **show interface** command. Check to see if the port has registered many alignment, FCS, or any other type of line errors. If these errors are incrementing continuously, the port might drop input BPDUs. If the input queue counter is incrementing continuously, the port is losing input packets because of a lack of receive buffers. This problem can also cause the port to drop incoming BPDUs.
* On a blocked spanning tree port, check the duplex configuration to ensure that the port duplex is set to the same type as the port of its neighboring device.
* On trunks, make sure that the trunk configuration is set properly on both sides of the link.
* On trunks, if the neighboring device supports it, set duplex to full on both sides of the link to prevent any collisions under heavy traffic conditions.
