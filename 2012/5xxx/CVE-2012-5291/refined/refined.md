{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'idteam' parameter of the 'team.php' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting SQL queries through the vulnerable parameter. Although it's a blind injection, successful exploitation can still lead to data breaches and other unauthorized activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter 'idteam' in the 'team.php' script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific privileges within the application are needed as the vulnerability is in the input sanitization."
