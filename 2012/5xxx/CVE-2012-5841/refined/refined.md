  "CVE-2012-5841": {
    "root_cause": "Improper security filtering for cross-origin wrappers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Security wrappers filter at the time of property access, but once a function is returned, the caller can use this function without further security checks.",
       "Cross-origin wrappers were allowing write actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly allowed."
    ],
    "impact": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Malicious content could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web pages.",
      "Specifically crafted HTML mail messages (though JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages, this could be exploited when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to trick a user into loading a malicious page."
