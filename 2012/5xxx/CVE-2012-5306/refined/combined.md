D-Link SecuriCam DCS-5605 Network Surveillance ActiveX Control
DcsCliCtrl.dll lstrcpyW Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

tested against: Microsoft Windows Server 2003 r2 sp2
                Internet Explorer 7/8

Live demo: http://203.125.227.70/eng/index.cgi
username: dlink
password: dlink

product homepage: http://www.d-link.com/products/?pid=771

product description:
"The DCS-5605 is a high performance camera for professional surveillance
and remote monitoring. This network camera features motorized pan,
tilt, and optical/digital zoom for ultimate versatility. The 10x optical
zoom lens delivers the level of detail necessary to identify faces, license
plate numbers, and other important details that are difficult to
clearly distinguish using digital zoom alone"

background:
When browsing the device web interface, the user
is asked to install an ActiveX control to stream
video content. This control has the following settings:

Description: Camera Stream Client Control
File version: 1.0.0.4519
Binary path: C:\Program Files\NetworkSurveillanceAX\DcsCliCtrl.dll
ProgID: DcsCliCtrl.DCSStrmControl.1
GUID: {721700FE-7F0E-49C5-BDED-CA92B7CB1245}
Implements IObjectSafety: Yes
Safe For Scripting (IObjectSafety): True
Safe For Initialization (IObjectSafety): True

Vulnerability:
the ActiveX control exposes the SelectDirectory()
method which supports one optional argument.
See typelib:
...
/* DISPID=22 */
	/* VT_BSTR [8] */
	function SelectDirectory(
		/* VT_VARIANT [12] [in] */ $varDefPath
		)
	{
		/* method SelectDirectory */
	}
...

This method suffers of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability
because an unsafe lstrcpyW() call inside DcsCliCtrl.dll:

...
100712E0   81EC 34040000    sub esp,434
100712E6   A1 2C841010      mov eax,dword ptr ds:[1010842C]
100712EB   33C4             xor eax,esp
100712ED   898424 30040000  mov dword ptr ss:[esp+430],eax

100712F5   8B9C24 48040000  mov ebx,dword ptr ss:[esp+448]
100712FC   55               push ebp
100712FD   8BAC24 40040000  mov ebp,dword ptr ss:[esp+440]
10071304   56               push esi

10071314   68 08020000      push 208
10071319   8D4424 34        lea eax,dword ptr ss:[esp+34]
1007131D   6A 00            push 0
1007131F   50               push eax
10071320   E8 0BC40300      call DcsCliCt.100AD730
10071325   83C4 0C          add esp,0C
10071328   85F6             test esi,esi
1007132A   74 0C            je short DcsCliCt.10071338
1007132C   56               push esi
1007132D   8D4C24 34        lea ecx,dword ptr ss:[esp+34]
10071331   51               push ecx
10071332   FF15 D4D20C10    call dword ptr ds:[<&KERNEL32.lstrcpyW>] ; kernel32.lstrcpyW <-------------
...

An attacker could entice a remote user to browse a web
page to gain control of the victim browser, by passing an overlong string to
the mentioned method and overwriting critical structures (SEH).

As attachment proof of concept code.

Note, to reproduce the wanted crash:
when the SelectDirectory() method is called the
user is asked to select a destination folder for the stream recorder.
To set EIP to 0x0c0c0c0c select a folder of choice, then proceed.
When clicking Cancel you have an unuseful crash, however it could be
possible that modifying the poc you will have EIP overwritten aswell.

I think that it is also possible that other products might carry this dll,
I could post an update if I find more.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
