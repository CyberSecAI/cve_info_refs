Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unsafe `lstrcpyW()` call within the `DcsCliCtrl.dll` ActiveX control. This function is used to copy a string, but it does not perform bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `SelectDirectory()` method of the ActiveX control is vulnerable. By providing an overly long string to this method, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack, including the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) frame.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By overwriting the SEH frame, an attacker can redirect the program's execution flow to their own shellcode. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running the vulnerable application. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to achieve this.
- **Browser compromise:** The exploit is triggered by a user browsing a malicious webpage. Successful exploitation leads to compromise of the user's browser, and potentially the entire system, depending on the shellcode's capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** A remote attacker can host a malicious webpage that, when visited by a user with the vulnerable ActiveX control installed, triggers the buffer overflow.
- **User interaction required:** The user needs to browse the attacker's webpage. The proof of concept also involves some user interaction, as the user is prompted to select a destination folder for the stream recorder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.
- **Malicious webpage hosting:** The attacker must host a webpage containing the exploit code.
- **Target must have vulnerable ActiveX control:** The victim machine must have the vulnerable D-Link DCS-5605 ActiveX control installed, specifically the `DcsCliCtrl.dll`.
- **Target user must use Internet Explorer:** The proof of concept specifies IE7 and IE8 as the tested browsers.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `SelectDirectory()` method of the ActiveX control `DcsCliCtrl.dll`, version `1.0.0.4519`.
- The vulnerable function is triggered during the process of selecting a destination folder for stream recording.
- The exploit works by passing a specially crafted oversized string to the `SelectDirectory()` method. This overruns a buffer, overwriting the SEH, and redirecting program execution to attacker controlled shellcode.
- The provided PoC includes a javascript exploit, which can be deployed on a web page.
- The vulnerability allows for remote code execution by exploiting a buffer overflow in the `lstrcpyW()` function.
- The content mentions that other D-Link products might use the same vulnerable dll, expanding the attack surface.
