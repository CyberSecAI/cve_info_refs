## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a

large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.

([CVE-2012-5374](/security/CVE-2012-5374))

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file

creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash

value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](/security/CVE-2012-5375))

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-232-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-232.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-232.48)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

  <http://crypto.junod.info/2012/12/13/hash-dos-and-btrfs/>

CVE-2012-5374 Btrfs CRC32C feature leads to an "infinite loop" or a
              similar lengthy runtime of filesystem operations

CVE-2012-5375 Btrfs CRC32C feature prevents file creation in ways
              that may cross privilege boundaries

Here are a few additional comments. We realize that the assignment of
CVE-2012-5374 is potentially problematic because the researcher did
not investigate the code to determine whether an infinite loop was
actually occurring. Our expectation is that, after source-code
analysis is completed by others, the correct number of CVE IDs for the
issue will still be one.

We realize that the assignment of CVE-2012-5375 is potentially
problematic because there is, in some sense, a vendor statement that
the software behavior is completely intentional ("Group writable
directories have other security issues, and so we picked the hash
knowing this kind of DOS was possible"). However, there are other
threat models that may be relevant in some environments, and some CVE
consumers may wish to track the stated behavior in conjunction with a
vulnerability-handling process. Thus, there arguably should be a CVE
for this issue in Btrfs, and other CVEs could be assigned on request
for each additional hash-based-filesystem codebase with a similar
behavior. As usual, the CVE project is willing to mark the CVE
descriptions as "** DISPUTED **" based on vendor information.

Here is an example of an alternative threat model that might be
relevant. Suppose a system has restricted user accounts that don't
have full shell access or full filesystem access. Specifically, users
have no mechanism for modifying or deleting the dotfiles in their home
directories, but can create other files. A security product, running
as root, automatically creates .hushlogin files in home directories
whenever the current motd has private information. A user can cross
privilege boundaries and bypass this security mechanism by creating a
file with a different name. One can argue that this isn't a
vulnerability in the security product because it couldn't reasonably
anticipate that existence of other filenames would trigger failure of
root's O_CREAT|O_WRONLY open system call for .hushlogin.

Btrfs: fix hash overflow handling

```
The handling for directory crc hash overflows was fairly obscure,
split_leaf returns EOVERFLOW when we try to extend the item and that is
supposed to bubble up to userland.  For a while it did so, but along the
way we added better handling of errors and forced the FS readonly if we
hit IO errors during the directory insertion.

Along the way, we started testing only for EEXIST and the EOVERFLOW case
was dropped.  The end result is that we may force the FS readonly if we
catch a directory hash bucket overflow.

This fixes a few problem spots.  First I add tests for EOVERFLOW in the
places where we can safely just return the error up the chain.

btrfs_rename is harder though, because it tries to insert the new
directory item only after it has already unlinked anything the rename
was going to overwrite.  Rather than adding very complex logic, I added
a helper to test for the hash overflow case early while it is still safe
to bail out.

Snapshot and subvolume creation had a similar problem, so they are using
the new helper now too.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a

large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.

([CVE-2012-5374](/security/CVE-2012-5374))

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file

creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash

value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](/security/CVE-2012-5375))

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-40.62~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-40-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)

  -
  [3.5.0-40.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-40.62)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1945-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

6 September 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a

large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.

([CVE-2012-5374](/security/CVE-2012-5374))

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the

Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file

creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash

value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](/security/CVE-2012-5375))

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that

allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to

run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](/security/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it

provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a

guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to

destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to

write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](/security/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to

connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](/security/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key\_socket implementation

in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine

potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](/security/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP\_CORK option in the

Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](/security/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux

kernel when the IPV6\_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in

combination with the UDP\_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](/security/CVE-2013-4163))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-232-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-232.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-232.48)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
