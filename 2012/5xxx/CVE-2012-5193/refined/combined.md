Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2012-016:
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Bitweaver

Published: 10/23/2012
Version: 1.0

Vendor: Bitweaver (http://www.bitweaver.org/)
Product: Bitweaver
Version affected: 2.8.1 and earlier versions

Product description:
Bitweaver is a free and open source web application framework and content
management system. Bitweaver is written in PHP and uses Firebird as a
database backend.

Finding 1: Local File Inclusion Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2012-5192

The 'overlay_type' parameter in the 'gmap/view_overlay.php' page in
Bitweaver is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be demonstrated by traversing to a known readable
path on the web server file system.

Example:

Performing LFI on 'overlay_type' parameter

#Request

http://A.B.C.D/bitweaver/gmap/view_overlay.php?overlay_type=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F/etc/passwd%00

#Response

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
<snip>

Finding 2: Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in Bitweaver
CVE: CVE-2012-5193

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been discovered
that allow remote unauthenticated users to run arbitrary scripts on the
system.

Example:

The following Proof of Concepts illustrate that Bitweaver 2.8.1 is
vulnerable to XSS.

Example(s):

1. Performing XSS on stats/index.php

[truncated due to length]

Remediation Steps:
The vendor has released a fix to address the Local File Inclusion
vulnerability (finding 1) and several of the Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities (finding 2) in Bitweaver 3.1. However, additional fixes for
the Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities were made on commit c3bef6f in the
development branch.  Users are recommended to download the latest release
of Bitweaver on http://github.com/bitweaver to address the above issues.

These issue can also be mitigated with the use of technologies, such as Web
Application Firewalls (WAF) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Often,
Vulnerability Scanners and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can detect the
presence of Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities and XSS. Trustwave
technologies that address this issue include the following.

ModSecurity (http://www.modsecurity.org/) has added rules to the commercial
rules feed for these issues, available as part of the SpiderLabs
ModSecurity rules feed.

Trustwave's vulnerability scanning solution, TrustKeeper
(https://www.trustwave.com/trustKeeper.php), has been updated to detect
affected versions.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# TWSL2012-016: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Bitweaver

![TWSL2012-016: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Bitweaver](https://www.trustwave.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Web/Spiders/2024/spider_01-mob.png?width=450&height=250&name=spider_01-mob.png)

October 24, 2012

1 Minute Read
by Robert Foggia

The Trustwave SpiderLabs team has published a new advisory for multiple vulnerabilities in Bitweaver. Bitweaver is a Content Management System (CMS) developed in PHP that can be used with a Firebird DB back-end. David Aaron and Jonathan Claudius from the SpiderLabs Research team discovered a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability and several XSS in the software while developing rules for the Trustkeeper scanning solution.

Earlier this year, Trustwave had contacted Bitweaver regarding these discovered vulnerabilities and our team worked with the vendor to get these issues addressed. The vendor has released Bitweaver version 3.1, which fixes the Local File Inclusion vulnerability and several of the XSS issues. However, Trustwave has reported incomplete fixes for XSS vulnerabilities found in this version in the "/users/register.php" page. The vendor has acknowledged that these issues were fixed in the development branch hosted on Github (https://github.com/bitweaver) and these fixes will be pushed in future versions of Bitweaver.

For further protections, it is recommended that a Web Application Firewall (WAF) be installed when using this software. ModSecurity has added protection in the commercial feed and [WebDefend](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/#overview) can protect against these vulnerabilities as well. Additionally, the TrustKeeper scanning solution has been updated "auto-magically" to detect these vulnerabilities.
