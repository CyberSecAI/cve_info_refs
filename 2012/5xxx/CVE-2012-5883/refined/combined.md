[Patched swfstore.swf for YUI 2.8.2 (Bugzilla 4.0)](attachment.cgi?id=678540)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=678540&action=edit)

Bugzilla 3.6 has no SWF files in js/yui/ and so is not affected by the vulnerability described here. Bugzilla 4.0 and newer all have:
md5sum ./swfstore/swfstore.swf 8526b66bd23fe8cebfa3426ad9c74ff0
This is the md5sum of swfstore.swf being released with YUI 2.8.0 - 2.8.2 ([bug 606618](/show_bug.cgi?id=606618 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla 4.0 and Trunk need a YUI upgrade to avoid .swf XSS vulnerability")).
Per <http://yuilibrary.com/support/20121030-vulnerability/>, this SWF file is affected. Bugzilla 4.2 and newer were supposed to be fully upgraded to YUI 2.9.0 ([bug 649879](/show_bug.cgi?id=649879 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update to YUI 2.9.0")) which is not affected by this issue, and which has the following checksum:
md5sum ./swfstore/swfstore.swf 844a3718c5f8c04ece6a86065a658a07
But this file has not been included in the list of updated files in [bug 649879](/show_bug.cgi?id=649879 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update to YUI 2.9.0"), and so we are still storing the file from YUI 2.8.x instead of the new one from YUI 2.9.0. Consequently, we are vulnerable to [CVE-2012-5475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-5475). :(
Attached is the patched swfstore.swf file for YUI 2.8.2 (Bugzilla 4.0):

Is that true? The updated announcement says 2.9.0 and that checksum are vulnerable according to their table, and says the 2.9.0 patch is "Coming Soon"

That is the checksum listed as the fix for the 2.8.2 version, don't know why that isn't also the fix for the 2.9.0 version.

What do we use those for, I don't think I've ever run across flash on BMO. If we don't use it can we simply delete it?
Do we have the affected charts.swf and/or uploader.swf as well?

Just because extensions may use it doesn't mean we need it on BMO. We should remove it, as it's already been the cause of security problems before.

this bug is isn't about bmo.
what are thoughts on updating the .swf, but also adding an explicit entry to .htaccess to block all of yui's .swf files? sites which have installed an extension can remove the block, while other sites gain protection against any further issues.

That was true when I wrote that comment. Meanwhile, I emailed the YUI team to notify them that they said that swfstore.swf was only vulnerable in YUI 2.8.0 and 2.8.1, but not in 2.8.2. But YUI 2.8.2 has the same file as previous 2.8.x releases. So they investigated, and they replied that 2.8.2 and 2.9.0 were indeed also affected. So the support page has been updated during the night, after I posted my comment. So we will indeed also need a patched SWF file for 2.9.0. I will attach it here once it's available.

I think that was a bad decision, but it seems I was the only one to complain when these SWF files have been added to the bugzilla repo. There is no reason to only include two of the four SWF files from YUI. I think there is no rationale behind this. Also, we usually never include stuff which we don't use in the core code, but these two SWF files have been added anyway.
AFAIK, YUI3 no longer uses these SWF files, so this is another good reason to leave YUI2 asap.

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Confidential product and component names can be disclosed to
  unauthorized users if they are used to control the visibility of
  a custom field.

* When calling the 'User.get' WebService method with a 'groups'
  argument, it is possible to check if the given group names exist
  or not.

* Due to incorrectly filtered field values in tabular reports, it is
  possible to inject code which can lead to XSS.

* When trying to mark an attachment in a bug you cannot see as
  obsolete, the description of the attachment is disclosed in the
  error message.

* A vulnerability in swfstore.swf from YUI2 can lead to XSS.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    3.3.4 to 3.6.11, 3.7.1 to 4.0.8, 4.1.1 to 4.2.3, 4.3.1 to 4.3.3
Fixed In:    3.6.12, 4.0.9, 4.2.4, 4.4rc1
Description: If the visibility of a custom field is controlled by
             a product or a component of a product you cannot see,
             their names are disclosed in the JavaScript code
             generated for this custom field despite they should
             remain confidential.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731178
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-4199

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0.8, 4.1.1 to 4.2.3, 4.3.1 to 4.3.3
Fixed In:    4.0.9, 4.2.4, 4.4rc1
Description: Calling the User.get method with a 'groups' argument leaks
             the existence of the groups depending on whether an error
             is thrown or not. This method now also throws an error if
             the user calling this method does not belong to these
             groups (independently of whether the groups exist or not).

Description: Trying to mark an attachment in a bug you cannot see as
             obsolete discloses its description in the error message.
             The description of the attachment is now removed from
             the error message.

# Security Bulletin: Addressing a Vulnerability in YUI 2.4.0 through YUI 2.9.0

**October 30, 2012** -- A XSS vulnerability has been discovered in some YUI 2 `.swf` files from versions 2.4.0 through 2.9.0. This defect allows JavaScript injection exploits to be created against domains that host affected YUI `.swf` files. Patched files are provided below.

**Note:** This vulnerability is similar to, but not the same as, the vulnerability that was [announced in 2010](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/10/25/yui-2-8-2-security-update/).

**Note:** This vulnerability is also listed under [CVE-2012-5881](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5881), [CVE-2012-5882](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5882), and [CVE-2012-5883](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5883).

If your site loads YUI 2 from a **CDN** (yui.yahooapis.com, ajax.googleapis.com, etc.) and not from your own domain, you are **not** affected. **YUI 3 is not affected by this issue.**

Whether or not your site uses the affected components, **simply hosting an affected file means you are vulnerable.** Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

## 1. Check

Determine whether you are hosting affected files from YUI versions 2.4.0 - 2.9.0. You can do this by [checking the MD5s](#dropins) of the `.swf` files in your hosted YUI 2 directory.

## 2. Resolve

You have 3 options for resolving the issue:

1. If you are hosting affected YUI 2 `.swf` files but not using them, simply delete them from your servers to resolve the vulnerability.
2. [Download drop-in replacements](#dropins) for the affected files and replace the affected files with the patched versions.
3. Load the assets from CDN rather than hosting on your servers. The [YUI 2 Dependency Configurator](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/) can help you generate URLs for either CDN. (Yahoo!'s CDN support's combo-handling but not SSL; Google's supports SSL but not combo-handling.)

## 3. Verify

Recheck your site comparing MD5s for YUI 2 `.swf` files hosted on your domain and ensuring that the [vulnerable files listed on this page](#dropins) are no longer present on your server.

## Affected Files and Patches

The following files are known to be compromised by this vulnerability. To find out the MD5 hash of the files you are hosting, use either the **md5** or **md5sum** utility on Linux or OS X, or [this](http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/) equivalent application on Windows.
