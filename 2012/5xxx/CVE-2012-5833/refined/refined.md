**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Mesa's OpenGL implementation, specifically how it handles `texImage2D` calls with a mipmap level greater than 0 on a newly created texture. The Mesa library crashes due to memory access errors when it fails to properly allocate memory for these textures at certain mipmap levels.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** An integer overflow when calculating the texture size. Mesa incorrectly handles `texImage2D` calls involving level > 0, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (application crash) and, in some configurations (Intel drivers), arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption. 
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through a malicious webpage that utilizes WebGL to trigger the vulnerable code path within Mesa.
    * A malicious website using WebGL can manipulate texture data, which can trigger the crash condition. 
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to serve a webpage containing the malicious WebGL code, which the victim must then access using a vulnerable browser.
    * No authentication or specific user privileges are required for exploitation.

**3. Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability involves an integer overflow when calculating the size of a texture at a given mipmap level.
*   The bug is triggered in Mesa's `llvmpipe_resource_map` function, when the `level` parameter is not zero. The crash occurs in `xlib_displaytarget_map`.
*   The issue also appears to be present in `copyTexImage2D` function calls.
*   The vulnerability exists in multiple OpenGL drivers.

**4. Mitigation**

*   The primary mitigation is to update to patched versions of Firefox which, in turn, implement a workaround that prevents triggering the mesa bug.
* The workaround involves rejecting `texImage2D` calls when:
    *   `level` is greater than zero, and
    *   mip-map level 0 is undefined, OR
    *   mipmap level 0 has the same width or height as the targeted mipmap level.
*  Another workaround involves performing a dummy `texImage2D` call to allocate the level 0 images.
*   A more accurate fix involves checking the width and height against `maxSize`, returning a `GL_INVALID_VALUE` error.

**5. Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Firefox, including both stable and ESR branches, and also affects other browsers which utilize mesa.
*   The issue is marked as `sec-critical` due to the potential for arbitrary code execution on some systems.
*   The issue affects multiple Linux distributions, requiring patches for Red Hat, openSUSE, and Ubuntu.

In summary, CVE-2012-5833 is a critical vulnerability stemming from an integer overflow in Mesa's OpenGL implementation that can be triggered through malicious WebGL content, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution. Patches and workarounds focus on preventing the vulnerable code path in Mesa from being triggered through careful checks and texture size limitations in higher-level libraries (like Firefox's WebGL implementation).
