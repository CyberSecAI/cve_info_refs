The provided content from Exploit Database describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Ezylog Photovoltaic Management Server.  The specific CVE IDs listed are CVE-2012-5864, CVE-2012-5863, CVE-2012-5862, and CVE-2012-5861, meaning the document relates to the specified CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**a) SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root cause:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in web pages. Specifically, the `inverterselect` GET parameter in `dettagliinverter.php` and the `lingua` POST parameter in `changelanguagesession.php` are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** SQL injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows attackers to interact with the MySQL database. They can access sensitive information like username/password combinations stored in plain text.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious GET or POST requests to vulnerable pages with crafted SQL injection payloads.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**b) Hard-coded Accounts:**

*   **Root cause:** The `login.php` page contains hardcoded password checks that bypass the database authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Hardcoded credentials. Specifically, the passwords `36e44c9b64` (which decrypts from `satIZufhIrUfk`) and `astridservice` (when the `stilecustumization` variable is set to `astrid`). A third hardcoded username/password combination is inserted into the database upon successful login using `saF8bay.tvfOk`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Allows an attacker to bypass normal authentication procedures and gain administrative access.
*   **Attack vectors:** Providing the hardcoded password strings in the login form, regardless of the username.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**c) Command Injection:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper sanitization of the `ip_dominio` POST parameter in `ping.php`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Command injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device with administrative privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to `ping.php` with a malicious `ip_dominio` parameter, including command injection characters (e.g., `&`).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**d) Broken Session Enforcement:**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of proper session verification for web pages.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Missing session management.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit the command-execution and SQL injection vulnerabilities without having a valid session.
*  **Attack vectors:** Accessing vulnerable web pages directly without prior authentication.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The document details multiple severe vulnerabilities in the Ezylog photovoltaic management server, including:
*   SQL Injection
*   Hard-coded credentials
*   Command Injection
*   Broken session enforcement.

These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated remote attackers to gain complete control of the affected systems. The advisory also mentions that the same software is shared among different products from various manufacturers, extending the potential impact.
