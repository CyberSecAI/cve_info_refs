How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I paid for Premiums Support over a week ago and to date have not heard from them or received any support at all.
Feels like a scam.
Can anybody tell me if they are actually still doing anything?
How do I get my money back because clearly they have not provided what was purchased.
VERY UNHAPPY!!!
AND
What is the point in having a link to non-existing ‘training videos’?
On the Details page you have:
Learn quickly with our video tutorials
Click on the ‘video tutorials’ link and you get a ‘Page Not Found’ error.

First of all, the code is not documented AT ALL! and they code in a way which is impossible to be understood without documentation.
Second, no documentation is online on their website, they don’t reply to emails and none of the issues related to this plugin on github or on wordpress.org are solved, they have not even tried to solved them. So I assume there is no support team.
Everyone, use WooCommerce, I haven’t tried it yet, but it’s definitely better supported.
To be honest, I am disappointed I can’t give them 0 stars instead of 1.

Just first time I have to set up a Wordpress payment, and this Plugin just made it extremely easy. I’ve just had an issue from my server and the IPN, that was filtered and blocked. The amazing support service of this plugin spot the problem and now i can use it without any problem.
A big Up for Mihai and WP eCommerce!
