{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The jboss-as-domain-management and jbosssx (now part of PicketLink) modules, when using LDAP authentication, allowed users to authenticate with a blank password if the LDAP server supported unauthenticated authentication. This violated RFC 4513 recommendations, which disallows empty passwords.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of empty passwords during LDAP authentication.",
      "Failure to enforce the requirement for non-empty passwords in name/password authentication interfaces."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass intended authentication by providing an empty password for a valid username, gaining unauthorized access to the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Remote unauthenticated access"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs knowledge of a valid username in the system, and the ability to connect to the JBoss server."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (various versions: 4.3.0, 5.2.0, 6.0.1)",
    "JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0",
    "JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1",
    "JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform (4.3.0, 5.2.2)",
    "JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform (4.2.0, 4.3.0)",
	  "JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves setting the `allowEmptyPasswords` option for LDAP login modules to `false` by default. In some configurations where `ldap` is used directly and empty passwords are required, this configuration change may break compatibility unless modifications are implemented in the configuration.  The issue affects multiple JBoss products and versions and requires a restart of the JBoss server process for the fix to take effect."
