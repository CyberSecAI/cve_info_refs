| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c0)  David Jorm    2012-12-10 05:45:45 UTC  ``` The jboss-as-domain-management and jbosssx (now part of PicketLink) modules under default conditions allow users to authenticate with a blank password when LDAP authentication is configured and unauthenticated authentication is supported by the LDAP server. This is in violation of the recommendations of RFC 4513, which states that clients should disallow empty passwords as input to a name/password authentication interface, and not allow the input of an empty password to trigger the selection of the unauthenticated authentication mechanism.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:22:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWP 5 for RHEL 4   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0230 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0230.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:23:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 5 for RHEL 4   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0229 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0229.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:33:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 6 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 6 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0231 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0231.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:44:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1  Via RHSA-2013:0234 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0234.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:45:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0  Via RHSA-2013:0233 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0233.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:45:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0  Via RHSA-2013:0232 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0232.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-11 18:01:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10  Via RHSA-2013:0248 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0248.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-11 18:13:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 4   JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2013:0249 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0249.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-04 21:01:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1   JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3.0 CP07   JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2   JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0 CP05   JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3.0 CP05  Via RHSA-2013:0586 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0586.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-20 15:59:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2013:0665 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0665.html>   ``` |  |

RHSA-2013:0233 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2013:0233 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one security
issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light
and rich Java applications.

When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
(LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and
configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red
Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5 for RHEL 6 x86\_64
* Red Hat JBoss Middleware Text-Only Advisories for RHEL 6 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 885569](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=885569)
  - CVE-2012-5629 JBoss: allows empty password to authenticate against LDAP

# RHSA-2013:0533 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1, which fixes multiple security issues,
various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

This release of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 serves as a replacement
for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0. It includes various bug fixes and
enhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1
Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/>

## Description

Security:

JBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric
keys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire
plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)

Spring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)
expressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information
from the server. (CVE-2011-2730)

Note: Manual action is required to apply the fix for CVE-2011-2730. If your
system has deployed applications which use Spring framework, the context
parameter "springJspExpressionSupport" must be set to "false" to mitigate
this flaw, for example, in the application's web.xml file. This will
prevent the double-evaluation of EL expressions that led to this flaw.

An XSS flaw allowed a remote attacker to perform an XSS attack against
victims using the JMX Console. (CVE-2011-4575)

SecurityAssociation.getCredential() returned the previous credential if
no security context was provided. Depending on the deployed applications,
this could possibly allow a remote attacker to hijack the credentials of a
previously-authenticated user. (CVE-2012-3370)

A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
arrays (hashes) in JRuby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
inputs to a JRuby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, the Murmur
hash function has been replaced with the Perl hash function.
(CVE-2012-5370)

Note: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of
the scripting\_chain quickstart example application. The CVE-2012-5370 flaw
is not exposed unless the version of JRuby shipped with that quickstart is
used by a deployed, custom application.

Configuring the JMX Invoker to restrict access to users with specific
roles did not actually restrict access, allowing remote attackers with
valid JMX Invoker credentials to perform JMX operations accessible to
roles they are not a member of. (CVE-2012-5478)

twiddle.sh accepted credentials as command line arguments, allowing local
users to view them via a process listing. (CVE-2009-5066)

NonManagedConnectionFactory logged the username and password in plain text
when an exception was thrown. This could lead to the exposure of
authentication credentials if local users had permissions to read the log
file. (CVE-2012-0034)

The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow
unauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security
interceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation
of this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently
disabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context
of the user running the JBoss server. (CVE-2012-0874)

CallerIdentityLoginModule retained the password from the previous call if a
null password was provided. In non-default configurations this could

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c0)  David Jorm    2012-12-10 05:45:45 UTC  ``` The jboss-as-domain-management and jbosssx (now part of PicketLink) modules under default conditions allow users to authenticate with a blank password when LDAP authentication is configured and unauthenticated authentication is supported by the LDAP server. This is in violation of the recommendations of RFC 4513, which states that clients should disallow empty passwords as input to a name/password authentication interface, and not allow the input of an empty password to trigger the selection of the unauthenticated authentication mechanism.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:22:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWP 5 for RHEL 4   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0230 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0230.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:23:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 5 for RHEL 4   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0229 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0229.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:33:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 6 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 6 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0231 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0231.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:44:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1  Via RHSA-2013:0234 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0234.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:45:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0  Via RHSA-2013:0233 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0233.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-04 23:45:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0  Via RHSA-2013:0232 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0232.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-11 18:01:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10  Via RHSA-2013:0248 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0248.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-11 18:13:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 4   JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2013:0249 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0249.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-04 21:01:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1   JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3.0 CP07   JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2   JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0 CP05   JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3.0 CP05  Via RHSA-2013:0586 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0586.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=885569#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-20 15:59:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2013:0665 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0665.html>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0231)

## Topic

Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 packages that fix one
security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications
based on JBoss Application Server 7.

When using LDAP authentication with either the "ldap" configuration entry
or the provided LDAP login modules (LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule),
empty passwords were allowed by default. An attacker could use this flaw to
bypass intended authentication by providing an empty password for a valid
username, as the LDAP server may recognize this as an 'unauthenticated
authentication' (RFC 4513). This update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option
for the LDAP login modules to false if the option is not already
configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Note: If you are using the "ldap" configuration entry and rely on empty
passwords, they will no longer work after applying this update. The
jboss-as-domain-management module, by default, will prevent empty
passwords. This cannot be configured; however, a future release may add a
configuration option to allow empty passwords when using the "ldap"
configuration entry.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0229)

## Topic

An updated jbosssx2 package for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0
that fixes one security issue is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
4, 5, and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
JBoss Seam.

When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
(LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated
package. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

RHSA-2013:0234 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-02-04
Updated:
2013-02-04
# RHSA-2013:0234 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 which fixes one
security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications
based on JBoss Application Server 7.

When using LDAP authentication with either the "ldap" configuration entry
or the provided LDAP login modules (LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule),
empty passwords were allowed by default. An attacker could use this flaw to
bypass intended authentication by providing an empty password for a valid
username, as the LDAP server may recognize this as an 'unauthenticated
authentication' (RFC 4513). This update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option
for the LDAP login modules to false if the option is not already
configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Note: If you are using the "ldap" configuration entry and rely on empty
passwords, they will no longer work after applying this update. The
jboss-as-domain-management module, by default, will prevent empty
passwords. This cannot be configured; however, a future release may add a
configuration option to allow empty passwords when using the "ldap"
configuration entry.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 as provided from
the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed
applications.

The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

5, and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light
and rich Java applications.

When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
(LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and
configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package. The JBoss
server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# RHSA-2013:0248 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 which fixes
one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
JBoss Seam.

When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
(LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 as provided
from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHSA-2013:0232 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-02-04
Updated:
2013-02-04
# RHSA-2013:0232 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one
security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
JBoss Seam.

When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
(LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 as provided from
the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform from RHUI 5 x86\_64
* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 for RHEL 6 x86\_64
* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Text-Only Advisories x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 885569](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=885569)
  - CVE-2012-5629 JBoss: allows empty password to authenticate against LDAP

RHSA-2013:0586 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-03-04
Updated:
2013-03-04
# RHSA-2013:0586 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: jbosssx security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1, JBoss Enterprise Portal
Platform 4.3.0 CP07 and 5.2.2, and JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0
CP05, and 4.3.0 CP05 which fixes one security issue is now available from
the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform is a business rules management system for
the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss
Rules. JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation
of the Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the
next-generation ESB and business process automation infrastructure.

When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
(LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss installation,
including any databases, database settings, applications, configuration
files, and so on.

All users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1, JBoss Enterprise Portal
Platform 4.3.0 CP07 and 5.2.2, and JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0
CP05, and 4.3.0 CP05 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are
advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains download links (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your
JBoss installation, including any databases, database settings,
applications, configuration files, and so on.

For JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform, JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, and
JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform, it is recommended to halt the server by
stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this
update, and then after installing the update, restart the server by
starting the JBoss Application Server process.
