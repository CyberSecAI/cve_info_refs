- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A client-side cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the DirectAdmin web application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically in the `domain` parameter within the `CMD_DOMAIN` module. This allows injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, account theft, and client-side context manipulation. An attacker with a privileged user account can target other users including customers, moderators, or administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `domain` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs a privileged user account and the ability to trick a victim user into accessing a malicious URL.
