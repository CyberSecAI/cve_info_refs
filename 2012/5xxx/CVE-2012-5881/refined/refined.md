The content is related to CVE-2012-5881.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in some YUI 2 `.swf` files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows JavaScript injection exploits.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for JavaScript injection attacks against domains hosting affected YUI `.swf` files. This could lead to malicious actions on the victim's browser, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable YUI 2 `.swf` files hosted on a server, specifically the charts.swf, uploader.swf and swfstore.swf files in YUI versions 2.4.0 through 2.9.0. Attackers inject malicious JavaScript through these files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject Javascript into the vulnerable SWF files which can be achieved if the SWF files are hosted on a site and accessible by the attacker or if a MITM attack can be performed.
