Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-5889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the failure to properly sanitize user input within the "powermail" extension for TYPO3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs when user-supplied data is not properly escaped or sanitized before being included in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of exploitation is rated as "Medium" and specifically for this instance, the CVSS vector describes no impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (C:N/I:N/A:N). While no impact is listed, XSS vulnerabilities in general can be used to perform a wide variety of attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the internet.
- The attack complexity is medium (AC:M), suggesting the attacker may need some specific knowledge or may need to trick a user to trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts through user input into the "powermail" extension. This could be done by submitting crafted data through forms or other input methods used by the extension. No authentication (Au:N) is required.

**Additional Notes**

- The affected component is a third-party extension and not part of the TYPO3 default installation.
- The affected versions are 1.6.4 and below of the "powermail" extension.
- A fix was released in version 1.6.5 of the "powermail" extension, and users are advised to update.
- The report was made possible due to the discovery by David Henninger, Oliver Meyfarth and Security Team member Markus Bucher
