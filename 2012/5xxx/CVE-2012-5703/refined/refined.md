- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The VMware vSphere API contains a denial-of-service vulnerability due to a maliciously crafted API request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of API requests within the vSphere API, allowing a crafted request to disable the host daemon.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service. Specifically, it would disable the host daemon, preventing management activities on the host. However, virtual machines running on the host would remain unaffected.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a network-based attack, where an unauthenticated attacker sends a malicious API request to the vulnerable vSphere API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to send network requests to the vSphere API. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
