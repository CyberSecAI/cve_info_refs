Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-5050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the VMware vCenter Operations server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data within the vCenter Operations server application, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to steal an administrator's session cookie. This stolen cookie could then be used to impersonate the administrator, gaining unauthorized access to the vCenter Operations server and potentially the systems it manages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves social engineering. The attacker must convince a legitimate administrator to click on a malicious link that contains the crafted XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link containing a script that exploits the XSS vulnerability.
- The attacker also needs a method to deliver this link to the administrator, typically via email, instant message, or other means of communication.
- The administrator needs to be logged into vCenter Operations and have a valid session.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Alexander Minozhenko of ERPScan to VMware.
- The advisory indicates that vCenter Operations versions 1.0.x are affected while version 5.0.x is not. The recommended remediation is to upgrade to vCenter Operations 5.0.x.
- This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description which usually just indicates the presence of an XSS vulnerability without specifying impact, attack vector or affected versions.
