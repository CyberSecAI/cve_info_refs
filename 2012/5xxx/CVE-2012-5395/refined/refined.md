Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki not regenerating the session ID upon user login. It reuses the existing session ID from the browser cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is session fixation. The CentralAuth extension does not refresh the `centralauth_Session` cookie upon login, allowing an attacker to potentially pre-set the cookie to a known value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Impersonation:** If an attacker can set the session cookie to a known value on a victim's browser, and the victim later logs in, the attacker can then use that same session ID to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attack requires the attacker to set a specific cookie (`centralauth_Session`) in the victim's browser with a known value before the victim logs in.
*   **Exploiting XSS or other vulnerabilities:** The attacker can leverage other vulnerabilities, such as XSS, to set the malicious cookie.
* **Shared Environment:** In a shared environment, the attacker could setup the malicious cookie on a shared machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Set Cookies:** The attacker needs the ability to set a specific cookie in the victim's browser before the victim logs in. This could be achieved through various means such as exploiting a vulnerability, or having access to the victim's browser directly (for example on a shared machine).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text also mentions CVE-2012-5391 which is related to a similar session fixation issue in the core MediaWiki software. CVE-2012-5395 is specific to the CentralAuth extension.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by regenerating the session ID on login.
* The fix was deployed on the cluster on November 15th.
* The version affected is not specified, but it was addressed in the 1.20.1, 1.19.3 and 1.18.6 security releases.
