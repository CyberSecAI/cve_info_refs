## Centreon 2.3.3 through 2.3.9-4 blind sqli injection vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Note VU#856892

Original Release Date: 2012-12-12 | Last Revised: 2012-12-12

---

### Overview

Centreon 2.3.3 through 2.3.9-4 contains a blind sql injection vulnerability.

### Description

| [CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html): Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')  Centreon 2.3.3 through 2.3.9-4 contains a blind sql injection vulnerability. The vulnerability is found within the menuXML.php file inside the 'menu' parameter. It was reported that by injecting a payload after the menu parameter, for example '  AND SLEEP(5) AND 'meHL'='meHL, the web application hung for 5 seconds. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote authenticated attacker may be able to run a subset of SQL commands against the back-end database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**The vendor has stated that this vulnerability has been addressed in [Centreon 2.4.0](http://forge.centreon.com/projects/centreon/repository/revisions/13749). Users are advised to update to Centreon 2.4.0 or newer. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an SQL request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
