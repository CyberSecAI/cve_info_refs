  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-5784",
    "description": "Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect implementation of the hostname verification process within the Apache Axis library. Specifically, the `getCN` function does not verify that the server hostname matches the domain name present in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName fields of the X.509 certificate.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Missing hostname verification against X.509 certificate name",
          "Incomplete fix of previous related issue"
      ],
      "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can spoof SSL servers by presenting a valid certificate with a common name in a field that is not the CN field, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or unauthorized access to systems.",
      "attack_vector": "Network-based attack, where a man-in-the-middle attacker intercepts communication between a client and server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between a client and a server and present a valid SSL certificate. The attacker does not need to compromise CAs or forge certificates but needs to control a server and have a valid certificate for any domain name.",
