  "CVE-2012-5134": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer underflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded certain entities. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer underflow vulnerability exists in the `xmlParseAttValueComplex` function within `parser.c` of the libxml2 library, during the processing of XML entities.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer underflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening or processing a specially crafted XML document.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted XML document to a user or system processing XML with the vulnerable library. The attacker can be remote and does not require any authentication."
