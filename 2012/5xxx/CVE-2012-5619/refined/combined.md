| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=883330#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-04 10:33:45 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way the Sleuth Kit (TSK), a collection of UNIX-based command line tools allowing to investigate a computer, performed management of '.' (dotfile) file system entry. An attacker could use this flaw to evade detection by forensic analysis (hide certain files not to be scanned) by renaming the file in question it to be '.' file system entry.  The original reports speaks about this attack vector to be present when scanning FAT (File Allocation Table) file system. It is possible though, the flaw to be present on other file systems, which do not reserve usage of '.' entry for special purpose, too.

Subject: CVE request: TSK misrepresents "." files on FAT filesystems

The Sleuth Kit misrepresents files named "." on FAT filesystems. An
attacker could rename a file to "." to evade detection by a forensic
analysis.

Affected is the current version 4.0.1. Older versions are probably
affected as well.

No patch is currently available. The bug is tracked at
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3523019&group_id=55685&atid=477889>

AFAICS, the bug was originally identified by Wim Bertels
<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=1305739444.2355.35.camel%40zwerfkat&forum_name=sleuthkit-users>

Further discussion is at
<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20120503111900.GL18142%40hauptmenue&forum_name=sleuthkit-users>

The vulnerability is already exploited, for example, by the Flame
malware (possibly unintendedly). Flame uses an encrypted SQLite-DB named
"." for extraction of confidential files and for update distribution.
An analyst may miss the file as the Sleuth Kit does not appropriately
show the file.
