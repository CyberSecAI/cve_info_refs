Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The directory `/var/lib/gofer/journal/watchdog` was world-writable in `gofer` versions 0.67 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **World-Writable Directory:** The primary vulnerability is that the `watchdog` directory had permissions allowing any user on the system to write to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If journal entries are improperly removed from the world-writable directory, a denial of service condition could occur. The watchdog objects within this directory are used to track asynchronous messages by serial number, and tampering with these could disrupt the system's ability to process these messages correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker would need to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability, as it relies on manipulating files within the filesystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the vulnerable system to be able to write to the directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was addressed in `gofer` version 0.68.
*   The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact in CloudForms 1.1 and it is not planned to be addressed in future updates.
