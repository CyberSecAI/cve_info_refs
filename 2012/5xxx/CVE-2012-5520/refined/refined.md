Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-5520

**Vulnerability:** Command Injection

**Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied data when processing OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP) requests. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when OpenVAS Manager constructs shell commands using user-provided data (script, xml_file, output_file) without proper sanitization or escaping, leading to command injection.

**Weakness:**
*   Lack of input validation on data provided via OMP requests.
*   Use of shell command execution with concatenated user-controlled strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the OpenVAS Manager on the vulnerable system. This could include system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attacks by sending crafted OMP requests to the OpenVAS Manager.
*   The attack involves manipulating the parameters passed to the shell command. Specifically, the vulnerable code is:
    ```c
    command = g_strdup_printf ("/bin/sh %s %s > %s"
                                 " 2> /dev/null",
                                 script,
                                 xml_file,
                                 output_file);
    ```
    An attacker could inject malicious commands through the `script`, `xml_file` or `output_file` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send OMP requests to the OpenVAS Manager. This likely means they would need network access to the service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched by Greenbone Networks.
*   Patches were incorporated into new releases of OpenVAS Manager versions 3.0.x and 4.0.x.
*   The OpenVAS Manager version 2.0.5 appears to be not vulnerable to this specific issue because the vulnerable code was changed before version 2.0.5.  In version 2.0.5, the command execution does not have the IP and PORT to be sanitized.
