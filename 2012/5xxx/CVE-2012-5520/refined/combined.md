How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Greenbone OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a full-featured vulnerability scanner. Its capabilities
include unauthenticated and authenticated testing, various high-level
and low-level internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning
for large-scale scans and a powerful internal programming language
to implement any type of vulnerability test.

The scanner obtains the tests for detecting vulnerabilities from a
[feed](https://www.greenbone.net/en/feed-comparison/) that
has a long history and daily updates.

OpenVAS has been developed and driven forward by the company
[Greenbone](https://www.greenbone.net/en/) since 2006. As part of the commercial
vulnerability management product family Greenbone Enterprise Appliance,
the scanner forms the
[Greenbone Community Edition](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/background.html#architecture)
together with other open-source modules.

Read more about the history of OpenVAS
[here](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/background.html#history-of-the-openvas-project).

Doh, a document gets proof read by multiple people and yet it contains a
mistake.  In the Current Status section of the advisory, the date is
incorrect.  A corrected advisory is attached.

Subject: Re: Re: [OVSA20121112] OpenVAS Manager Vulnerable To
 Command Injection

Hello Tim,

  thank you for the heads up and notification.

The versions of openvas-manager package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16
and release of 17 is based on upstream 2.0.5 version yet. From what I have looked
and can tell from upstream advisory and patch (for 3.0.X version):
[1] <http://www.openvas.org/OVSA20121112.html>
[2] <http://wald.intevation.org/scm/viewvc.php?view=rev&root=openvas&revision=14437>

the CVE-2012-5520 does not seem to be applicable to OpenVAS-4 / openvas-manager 2.0.5
version yet:
[3] <http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-announce/2012-August/000140.html>

But prior definitely classifying Fedora 16 and Fedora 17 openvas-manager package versions
as not vulnerable to this issue, I would like to hear opinion / confirmation from someone
more familiar with OpenVAS code.

So could you confirm the CVE-2012-5520 wouldn't affect OpenVAS-4 2.0.X version (yet)?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Subject: Re: Re: Re: [OVSA20121112] OpenVAS Manager Vulnerable To Command Injection

Hello Jan,

in version 2.0.5 the discussed vulnerable like looks like this:
     command = g_strdup_printf ("/bin/sh %s %s > %s"
                                 " 2> /dev/null",
                                 script,
                                 xml_file,
                                 output_file);

So there is not IP and PORT to be sanitized so 2.0.5 is probably on the safe side of this vulnerability.

If you deem it safer we can bump to current 3.0.x version - I know it is usually nono, but there should be no casualties,
since I sincerely doubt there are _ANY_ openvas users on Fedora distribution (16/17) as half of the openvas suite packages is still under review.

Mainly the openvas suite doesn't work on current Fedora due to incompatibility between openvas network stack (openvas-libraries) and the gnutls library we have in Fedora.

Best regards
Michal Ambroz
(one of Fedora openvas-* packagers)
