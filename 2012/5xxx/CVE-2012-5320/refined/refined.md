{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Sagem F@ST 2604 ADSL router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The router's web interface allows changing user passwords, including the administrator password, via a request to `password.cgi`. The lack of proper CSRF protection enables an attacker to craft a malicious HTML page that, when loaded by a logged-in user, will silently change the router password.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change the router's administrator password without the user's knowledge or consent, effectively taking over control of the device. This can lead to complete loss of control over the router and the connected network.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page, which, when loaded by a user already logged into the router's web interface, automatically submits a password change request to `password.cgi`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host the malicious HTML page and entice a user logged into the vulnerable router to access the page. The user must be logged into the router's web interface when accessing the malicious page for the attack to work. No specific network access is required."
