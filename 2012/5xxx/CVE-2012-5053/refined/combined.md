Version 4.70
Revision A
January 2013

New features and changes

General
• General operating system stability improvements.

•

RTK engine processor usage reduced.

• Minor translation updates.

Data formats

•

•

•

Improved QZSS almanac handling. This resolves a rare issue where a bad almanac could cause a
gap in T02/RT27 data.

RTCM version 3 no longer waits for UTC offset data to output valid GPS RTCM data after all
almanac and ephemeris data has been cleared.

BINEX:

–

Improved handling of SBAS L5 observations.

– Web UI now requires BINEX measurements to be enabled before MetaData can be selected.

– Now outputs receiver ID upon initial connection and every 30 minutes thereafter.

•

RT17/27 now outputs receiver ID upon initial connection and then every 30 minutes on the hour.

• NMEA:

–

–

Resolves one to two missing NMEA epochs when switching OmniSTAR™ modes.

VRS™ operation now results in output of NMEA GGA to eight decimal places.

•

T02 files updated to support RTX derived positions.

Data logging

•

•

•

•

Resolves rare issue of logging memory not being recognized.

Improved QZSS almanac handling. This resolves a rare issue where a bad almanac could cause a
gap in T02/RT27 data.

Resolves issue where RINEX version 3 ephemeris files could have an incorrect month listed in the
header.

Email and FTP Push data files now contain the exact same number of characters. Previously these
would differ by one character.

Tracking

•

•

•

•

Enhanced signal spoofing protection.

Improved channel allocations for GNSS tracking.

Enhanced Galileo ephemeris handling.

Improved cold start time when operating in low signal level/challenging environments.

• NTP Server and Client functionality split into two separate tasks to reduce dependencies.

Web User Interface and front panel
• Updated Web User Interface (UI). The Web UI has been refreshed to maximize the screen area
available to display data. The menu bar can now be hidden to further increase the available
screen size. Additionally, the Web UI now uses a "cookie" to recall the last visited page, allowing
you to return to it.

–

–

Shows separate RTK motion state and receiver motion state only when the Position
Monitoring option bit is installed. When Position Monitoring is enabled, the RTK engine
motion state is set to kinematic while the receiver motion state remains as configured. The
RTK engine motion state status appears in the Receiver Configuration / Position page. When
the position monitor is disabled, the RTK motion state is set back to the receiver motion
state.

Shows the reference position entered in the position monitoring page in the position graph if
it is different from the reference station position in the reference station page.

– When Position Monitoring is enabled, it suppresses front panel warning message if receiving

and transmitting correction messages at the same time.

Improved GUI bandwidth and rendering.

RINEX Header information no longer visible to anonymous access.

•

•

• Updates to Correction Controls to resolve an issue where the receiver may not apply the settings

and use the incorrect correction source.

• Updates to the Daily Statistics email alert. Email now displays Current Statistics if the receiver has

not ran for the full 24 hour period.

•

Firmware Upgrade Check feature now returns response to query showing either no upgrade
available, upgrade available, or upgrade available but not in warranty.

Upgrade procedure

Make sure that the receiver firmware warranty date is March 2012 or later.

Use one of the following methods:

• WinFlash utility: Use the latest version that is available with the version 4.70 Web package.

•

Receiver Web User Interface: Make sure that the receiver is already running firmware version
4.xx or later. Download and install the version 4.70 *.TIMG file.

2      Infrastructure NetRS Receiver Release Notes

Introduction
These release notes describe changes made to the Trimble® Infrastructure NetRS® series
receivers. With this release, the receivers can use version 1.3-2 firmware.

This is a minor release that primarily addresses several security-related enhancements.

To date, Trimble has not received any reports of user-installed receivers that have had their
security compromised. However, recent trends within the industry indicate increasing
cyber-attacks. Therefore, Trimble strongly recommends that you upgrade to firmware version
1.3-2, and review the security implemented in your receiver.

For a general guideline on receiver security, go to:

http://trl.trimble.com/dscgi/ds.py/Get/File-
636175/InfrastructureSupNote_NetRx%20Security%20Guidelines.pdf

Given the security-related aspect of this release, all Trimble NetRS receivers are entitled to install
this firmware version regardless of the current firmware warranty date.

Before you upgrade the firmware, download and back up any files or configuration settings.

Changes

Security

This release includes updates to help protect the NetRS receiver against several types of network
and RF-based attacks that were identified during security vulnerability assessments.

Upgrading the firmware
1. Make sure that the receiver has sufficient free memory to upload the firmware file.

2. Use the NetRS browser interface to upload the file onto your receiver.

3.

Click Install.

The installation process will take several minutes.
