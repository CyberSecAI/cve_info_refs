**AFFECTED PLATFORMS:**

The following versions are affected. IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.3 is not impacted.

· IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.2.1 and fix packs

· IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.2 and fix packs

· TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.1 and fix packs

· TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.0 and fix packs

· TRIRIGA Application Platform 2.7 and fix packs

· TRIRIGA Application Platform 2.6 and fix packs

· TRIRIGA Application Platform 2.5 and fix packs

· TRIRIGA Application Platform 2.1 and fix packs

· TRIRIGA Application Platform 8 and fix packs

**REMEDIATION:**

The recommended solution is to apply the fix for each named product as soon as practical. Please see below for information on the fixes available.

***Fix:***

These vulnerabilities are resolved in IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.3. Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, IBM strongly recommends that customers upgrade their platform to version 3.3 as soon as possible. Instructions on how to download and install IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.3 can be found here: [*IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.3 Download Instructions*](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24033723)

***Workaround:***

Until you apply the fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so IBM strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

***Mitigation:***

None Known
