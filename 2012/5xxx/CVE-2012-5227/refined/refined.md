Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Peel Shopping application (versions 2.8 and 2.9) contains vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks through the `recherche.php` and potentially other unspecified pages. The provided exploit example shows how to inject malicious JavaScript via the `motclef` parameter in `recherche.php` and also directly in the URI.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is also vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, specifically through the `tva.php` page when modifying an entry via the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the website
*   **SQLi:** An attacker could potentially:
    *   Gain access to sensitive database information
    *   Modify or delete database data
    *   Potentially gain control of the database server

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that inject JavaScript code.
*   **SQLi:** The attack vector is through crafted SQL queries injected into the application via URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges are explicitly mentioned as required, suggesting remote exploitation is possible.
*   The attacker needs to be able to identify the vulnerable pages with parameters and craft malicious payloads for XSS and SQLi

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided content contains explicit vulnerable URLs, making reproduction easier.
*   The vulnerabilities are present in Peel Shopping versions 2.8 and 2.9
*   The advisory also lists CVE-2012-5226, indicating a closely related vulnerability, but doesn't give specific details
