Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the flawed implementation of the DIGEST authentication mechanism in Apache Tomcat. Specifically, the server was tracking client nonces and nonce counts, rather than the server's own nonces, which effectively weakened the replay attack protection. Furthermore, authentication could be bypassed when a session ID was present and there was improper checking of username/password before indicating a stale nonce.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Nonce Tracking:** Tomcat tracked client nonces and nonce counts instead of server nonces, which is a core component of proper DIGEST implementation.
*   **Session ID Bypass:**  The authentication mechanism was bypassed entirely when a session ID was present.
*   **Stale Nonce Handling:** The user name and password checks were not performed before indicating a nonce was stale, which allowed bypassing of credential checks under certain conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Replay Attacks:** A remote attacker could perform replay attacks due to the flawed nonce handling.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Under certain circumstances, an attacker could bypass authentication by manipulating nonces or sessions.
*   **Access Restriction Bypass:** By bypassing authentication, an attacker could access resources they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Sniffing:** An attacker could sniff network traffic for valid requests containing nonces.
*   **Crafted Requests:** Maliciously crafted requests to exploit the vulnerabilities in the DIGEST implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests, possibly with crafted payloads.
*   **Understanding of DIGEST:** The attacker requires an understanding of HTTP Digest authentication and how to manipulate the nonce and related parameters to exploit the weaknesses.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was often addressed alongside CVE-2012-5886 and CVE-2012-5887, as they all relate to DIGEST authentication weaknesses in Tomcat. Some sources provide more detail on how each of the three CVEs relates to each other, including specifics on the conditions for exploitation.
