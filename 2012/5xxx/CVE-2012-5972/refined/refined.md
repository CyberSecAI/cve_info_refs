- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The built-in web server in SpecView software is vulnerable to directory traversal due to improper handling of ".." sequences in requested URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially access files and directories outside of the web server's intended document root, which may lead to information disclosure and potentially other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through specially crafted HTTP requests to the built-in web server. By including sequences like `../` in the URL, attackers can navigate the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SpecView web server to exploit the vulnerability.
