The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in B2Evolution CMS 4.1.3: a SQL injection and a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).

**1. SQL Injection**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in the `viewfile.php` script. Specifically, the `path` parameter is not sanitized, allowing the injection of SQL commands.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the application's database, potentially leading to complete database and application compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Remote exploitation via a crafted URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user but no further interaction with other users is required for this attack.

**2. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient input validation in the message sending functionality. The application does not properly sanitize HTML code within messages.
*   **Vulnerability:** Persistent XSS
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious script code that is stored on the server and executed within the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking of administrators and content manipulation.
*  **Attack vector:** Remote exploitation through the message sending feature.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user and send a crafted message to another user. Low user interaction by the target user is required as they need to view the message.

The vendor released version 4.1.4 to address these vulnerabilities. This information is also included in the provided content.
