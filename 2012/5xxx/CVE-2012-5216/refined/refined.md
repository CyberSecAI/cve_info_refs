- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HP ProCurve 1700 series switches are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially change the product settings if a logged-in user views a malicious page.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious page that, when viewed by a logged-in user, will send unauthorized requests to the switch.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious page and trick a logged-in user to visit the malicious page. The attacker can be located on the internet. The attack requires no authentication since IP addresses do not count as authentication.
