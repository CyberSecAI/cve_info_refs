| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 9.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 9.0 |

# [R1] Debian MediaTomb (fork) Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

[MediaTomb](http://mediatomb.cc/) is an open source UPnP MediaServer. For various reasons, MediaTomb has seen wide deployment over the years. However, the project appears to have been abandoned by the creators as the primary website hasn’t seen an update since 2010 and the SorceForge SVN repository [hasn’t seen a commit since 2014](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mediatomb/). However, that has not slowed the apparent love and integration of MediaTomb. The SourceForge page claims over 200 downloads this week, the discussion forums have been written to fairly recently, and [Stack Overflow still gets questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39398102/need-to-restart-mediatomb-to-get-it-recognized).

This is probably because [Ubuntu has continued offering it as a package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mediatomb). However, they [haven’t done a lot to the code themselves it appears](https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/wily/mediatomb/wily), even though [open bugs exists](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mediatomb). For the purposes of this write up, we will be referring to the Ubuntu package since they appear to be hosting/distributing more than anyone else. That said, other Linux distributions may have their own forks of MediaTomb and be vulnerable to the same issues below, such as Debian as we later confirmed.

About the MediaTomb Code

Anyone that has had the distinct displeasure of reading the [Portable Universal Plug and Play SDK (libupnp)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pupnp/) source code would immediately recognize that MediaTomb is built on a fork of libupnp. Indeed, some quick investigation into this confirmed that MediaTomb uses their own libUPnP with "[various custom patches and extensions](https://sourceforge.net/p/mediatomb/bugs/114/)". Notice, that the Fedora mediatomb package maintainer even links to a libupnp [CERT VU](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681). We can only assume that libupnp vulnerabilities don’t apply, right?

While testing a new NASL detection script, we found it was causing a crash in MediaTomb. Specifically, there is a NULL pointer dereference at in the function `check_soap_body()` in `soap_device.c` (line 470). We went to see if this had been patched in libupnp and found that it [had been patched eight years ago](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/2c094ee8ea01259967f82513296b031f718603fd/).

Given that MediaTomb is still being distributed by Ubuntu and more than 1,000 instances are [visible via Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=MediaTomb), we will make a best-effort to quickly flag some of the vulnerabilities that we know have been fixed in libupnp and still exist in MediaTomb. All of the below have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 Desktop using mediatomb-dbg.

Fedora actually has this in their bug tracker for MediaTomb along with the other 2012 stack overflows, [all unfixed](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=906045), despite [an upstream patch being available](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/2bb79879b77dd215a26c92d1348adf2ae406dfd8/).

We've written a PoC cleverly named "`cve-2012-5958.py`" that triggers the issue, producing the following stack trace:

```

#13 0x00007ffff4f9ab5d in clone () at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/clone.S:109

```

We’ve also written a PoC named "`cve-2012-5959.py`" (consistency is key) that triggers the issue, producing a different stack trace.

Bug 1948586

A null pointer dereference can be triggered via an HTTP POST with malformed SOAP data, [with an upstream patch available](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/2c094ee8ea01259967f82513296b031f718603fd/). We wrote a PoC cleverly named "`bug_1948586.py`" that triggers the issue in MediaTomb. Note that the old SourceForge bug tracker that used 7-digit IDs was deprecated, and it does not appear that those tickets were preserved, at least not publicly. As such, we only have a commit that references the old bug ID, and the commit details itself.

[Bug 133](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/bugs/133/) (no CVE)

A heap overflow can be triggered when providing specifically crafted callback parameters. Currently, there does not seem to be a patch for this issue. We wrote a PoC cleverly named "`bug_133.py`" that triggers the issue in MediaTomb to demonstrate the issue.

CVE-2016-6255

This allows a remote unauthenticated attacker create arbitrary files in the WebRoot simply by sending an HTTP POST request. Note that Ubuntu's mediatomb installation must have write permission to the WebRoot directory. This issue has been patched by commit [c91a8a3](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/c91a8a3903367e1163765b73eb4d43be7d7927fa/) and [66e43a2](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/66e43a28d27fee95d270d2b8106d8a099c14f334/). We wrote a PoC cleverly named "`barking_aardvark.py`" that when used like so:

`$ ./barking_aardvark.py http://192.168.1.217:49153/danger_zone`

Will result in a file being created. This can be seen in the default Ubuntu install, with the following sorcery:

```

albino-lobster@ubuntu:~ $ cat /usr/share/mediatomb/web/danger_zone
Better call Kenny Loggins
albino-lobster@ubuntu:~ $

```

### Solution

See the details above which link to fixing commits where applicable. Since this is a third-party library used within a fork of mediatomb and impacts multiple Linux distributions, it is up to each one to resolve the issues in their installation. In the meantime, restrict access to the mediatomb server.

### Proof of Concept

That's a negative Ghost Rider.

Stack-based buffer overflow in the unique\_service\_name function in ssdp/ssdp\_server.c in the SSDP parser in the portable SDK for UPnP Devices (aka libupnp, formerly the Intel SDK for UPnP devices) before 1.6.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a UDP packet with a crafted string that is not properly handled after a certain pointer subtraction.

# Security Flaws in Universal Plug and Play: Unplug, Don't Play

* Jan 29, 2013
* 3 min read
* [HD Moore](/blog/author/hd-moore/)

*Last updated at Tue, 03 Sep 2024 20:46:00 GMT*

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/post-images/14058/stats.png#img-half-right)

This morning we released a whitepaper entitled [Security Flaws in Universal Plug and Play](https://information.rapid7.com/rs/411-NAK-970/images/SecurityFlawsUPnP%20%281%29.pdf). This paper is the result of a research project spanning the second half of 2012 that measured the global exposure of UPnP-enabled network devices. The results were shocking to the say the least. Over 80 million unique IPs were identified that responded to UPnP discovery requests from the internet. Somewhere between 40 and 50 million IPs are vulnerable to at least one of three attacks outlined in this paper. The two most commonly used UPnP software libraries both contained remotely exploitable vulnerabilities. In the case of the [Portable UPnP SDK](http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/), over 23 million IPs are vulnerable to remote code execution through a single UDP packet. All told, we were able to identify over 6,900 product versions that were vulnerable through UPnP. This list encompasses over 1,500 vendors and only took into account devices that exposed the UPnP SOAP service to the internet, a serious vulnerability in of itself.

The vulnerabilities we identified in the Portable UPnP SDK have been fixed as of version 1.6.18 (released today), but it will take a long time before each of the application and device vendors incorporate this patch into their products. In most cases, network equipment that is "no longer shipping" will not be updated at all, exposing these users to remote compromise until UPnP is disabled or the product is swapped for something new. The flaws identified in the [MiniUPnP](http://miniupnp.free.fr/) software were fixed over two years ago, yet over 330 products are still using older versions.

For the reasons outlined above, we strongly suggest that end users, companies, and ISPs take immediate action to identify and disable any internet-exposed UPnP endpoints in their environments. UPnP is pervasive - it is enabled by default on many home gateways, nearly all network printers, and devices ranging from IP cameras to network storage servers.

To this end, we have provided [ScanNow UPnP](http://www.rapid7.com/resources/free-security-software-downloads/universal-plug-and-play-jan-2013.jsp), a free tool that can identify exposed UPnP endpoints in your network and flag which of those may remotely exploitable through recently discovered vulnerabilities. A screenshot of this tool in action in the lower right.

If you are accessing the internet from your home network, we now offer an alternative to ScanNow and Metasploit. The [Rapid7 UPnP Check](http://upnp-check.rapid7.com/) is a one-click security scan for broadband and mobile users. If you are concerned about the security of your non-technical friends and family, this is a quick way for them to check their home router for UPnP vulnerabilities. The main difference between this service and ScanNow is that the UPnP Check will run a scan from the internet and can only check the external interface of your router.

Although ScanNow only supports Microsoft Windows, users of Mac OS X and Linux can accomplish the same task using [Metasploit.](http://www.rapid7.com/downloads/metasploit.jsp) To use the latest module,which includes vulnerability reporting for the recently disclosed vulnerabilities, make sure you have the most current update applied.

Using this module within Metasploit's web interface is simple. Create a new project and access the Modules tab. In the search bar, enter "ssdp\_msearch", then select the module named **UPnP SSDP M-SEARCH Information Discovery**. Enter the network range you want to scan and Metasploit will take care of the rest. The module will run in the background and the Analysis tab will be updated with hosts and vulnerabilities as they are found.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/post-images/14058/scannow.png#img-half-right)

To accomplish the same task using the command-line, first open the Metasploit console.

```
$ msfconsole
msf>

```

From the msf prompt, enter the following commands, substituting your own network for RHOSTS

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/upnp/ssdp_msearch

msf  auxiliary(ssdp_msearch) > set RHOSTS 192.168.0.0/24

msf  auxiliary(ssdp_msearch) > run

```

Any devices supporting UPnP should appear, with specific CVEs listed for those that have at least one exploitable vulnerability.

```
[*] 192.168.0.9:1900 SSDP Net-OS 5.xx UPnP/1.0 | http://192.168.0.9:3278/etc/linuxigd/gatedesc.xml
[+] 192.168.0.254:1900 SSDP miniupnpd/1.0 UPnP/1.0 | vulns:2 (CVE-2013-0229, CVE-2013-0230)

```

If you are interested in hearing more about these issues, I will be hosting a [one-hour webcast on February 4th at 3:00pm EST](http://information.rapid7.com/Webcast-UPnP-Registration.html?LS=1677495%20&CS=blog).  You can also leave comments on this post.

Debian Bug     : 699316

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in libupnp, a library
used for handling the Universal Plug and Play protocol. HD Moore from Rapid7
discovered that SSDP queries where not correctly handled by the
unique_service_name() function.

An attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on libupnp
could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to the daemon
crash and possible remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.6-5+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp packages.

This library is used in several vendor network devices, in addition to media streaming and file sharing applications. These vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 29th, 2013 in a CERT Vulnerability Note, VU#922681, which can be viewed at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681>.  Affected Products  * Cisco is currently evaluating products for possible exposure to these UPnP vulnerabilities. Products will only be listed in the "Vulnerable Products" or "Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" sections of this advisory when a final determination about product exposure is made. Products that are not listed in either of these two sections are still being evaluated.   Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco TelePresence C Series Endpoints   + Cisco TelePresence System EX Series   + Cisco TelePresence SX20This section will be updated when more information is available.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are not affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco TelePresence EC20   + Cisco Telepresence Touch DevicesCisco Products based on IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR, and NX-OS do not use libupnp and are not affected.      The Cisco ASA Series Adaptive Security Appliance and the Firewall Services Modules (FWSM) do not use libupnp and are not affected.      This section will be updated when more information is available.  Details  * UPnP™ is an architecture that enables discovery, event notification, and control of devices on a network, independent of operating system, programming language, or physical network connection. UPnP™ is based on common Internet standards and specifications such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and XML.      The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices is affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in the processing of incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. CERT released the following CVE IDs to document these vulnerabilities: CVE-2012-5958, CVE-2012-5959, CVE-2012-5960, CVE-2012-5961, CVE-2012-5962, CVE-2012-5963, CVE-2012-5964, and CVE-2012-5965.

View the RV Series Routers End-of-Life Notices at <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9923/prod_eol_notices_list.html>  Workarounds  * UPnP can be disabled on many devices using the Web User Interface. Instructions on how to disable UPnP are generally given in the *Product Administration Guide*. For example, in the "Configuring Basic Firewall Settings" section of the *RV-120W Administration Guide*, there is a checkbox to enable/disable UPnP. For additional information, see <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/csbr/rv110w/administration/guide/rv110w_admin.pdf#page84>.      Customers should follow basic hardening rules when configuring wireless devices, such as not allowing "Guest" access and requiring authentication credentials to login.       Customers can also block traffic from untrusted hosts on UDP port 1900 to affected devices using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs). This protection mechanism filters and drops packets that are attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities.      Effective exploit prevention can also be provided by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance and the Firewall Services Module (FWSM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600 Series routers using transit access control lists (tACLs).

## Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) contains multiple buffer overflows in SSDP

#### Vulnerability Note VU#922681

Original Release Date: 2013-01-29 | Last Revised: 2014-07-30

---

### Overview

The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices libupnp library contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Devices that use libupnp may also [accept UPnP queries over the WAN interface](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/357851), therefore exposing the vulnerabilities to the internet.

### Description

| Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of network protocols designed to support automatic discovery and service configuration. The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) is an open source project that has its roots in the Linux SDK for UPnP Devices and software from Intel (Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies and later Developer Tools for UPnP Technologies). Intel no longer maintains or supports these tools. Many different vendors produce UPnP-enabled devices that use libupnp.  As part of a large scale security research project, [Rapid7](http://www.rapid7.com/) investigated internet-connected UPnP devices and found, among other security issues, multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the libupnp implementation of the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). Rapid7's report summarizes these vulnerabilities:***Portable SDK for UPnP Devices unique\_service\_name() Buffer Overflows****The libupnp library is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows when handling malicious SSDP requests. This library is used by tens of millions of deployed network devices, of which approximately twenty million are exposed directly to the internet. In addition to network devices, many streaming media and file sharing applications are also exposed to attack through this library.**This advisory does not address historic or current vulnerabilities in the HTTP and SOAP processing code of libupnp.****Affected Versions****Versions 1.2 (Intel SDK) and 1.2.1a - 1.8.0 (Portable SDK) are affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows in the unique\_service\_name() function, which is called to process incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. Additionally, versions prior to 1.6.17 are vulnerable to additional issues in the same function. Please see Appendix A for a review of the vulnerable code by version.****Affected Vendors****Hundreds of vendors have used the libupnp library in their products, many of which are acting as the home routers for consumer networks. Any application linking to libupnp is likely to be affected and a list of confirmed vendors and products is provided in Appendix B.*Additional details may be found in a [paper](https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-2150) and [advisory](https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2013/01/29/security-flaws-in-universal-plug-and-play-unplug-dont-play) from Rapid7. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**[libupnp 1.6.18](http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/) has been released to address these vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Deploy firewall rules to block untrusted hosts from being able to access port 1900/udp.**Disable UPnP**Consider disabling UPnP on the device if it is not absolutely necessary. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| We attempted to notify more than 200 vendors identified by Rapid7 as running libupnp. The following list includes vendors who responded to our notification and vendors for whom we had existing security contact information. |

Response to CERT VU#922681
1/31/2013

**Summary**

The Software Developer Kit (SDK) for Universal Plug-n-Play (UPnP) Devices contains a library originally developed as the Intel SDK for UPnP Devices. Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been found in the popular versions of this library used on many network vendor devices. For more information on this vulnerability please visit: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681>

**Affected Products**

IPitomy has not confirmed the vulnerability yet and is still investigating. However we are listing below the only products that could be affected as well as the recommended steps to prevent any potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

**IP1000 and IP1000v2**

 These products contain an affected version of the UPnP library. IPitomy recommends disabling UPnP permanently on these products.
 This product defaults the UPnP setting to “on”.
 Note we have scanned the IP1000 products from the WAN side and have determined that with the UPnP service on, the systems do not respond to UPnP requests from the WAN, therefore exploitation of these UPnP vulnerabilities would have to occur from the LAN side of the device.

**IPR20**

 IPR20 contains router functionality. The UPnP service is disabled by default on these devices. IPitomy recommends that you ensure that UPnP service is disabled.
 IPitomy has confirmed that if UPnP service is enabled the device does not respond to UPnP requests on the WAN interface, therefore exploitation of these UPnP vulnerabilities would have to occur through the LAN side of the device.
 Properly installed (IPR20 WAN port connected to customer LAN), devices should not present these vulnerabilities.

Title:
Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) contains multiple buffer overflows in SSDP
(US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#922681)

Summary:
US-CERT Note VU#922681 describes that the "Portable SDK for UPnP Devices libupnp" library contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Devices that use "libupnp" may also accept UPnP queries over the WAN interface, therefore exposing the vulnerabilities to the internet. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause a denial of service.

Details can be found at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681> and <https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-2150>

Comment:
The UPnP implemention used in the BOSS operating system is a proprietary solution developed by Teldat, and no Teldat product running the BOSS operating system is affected. Note that products sold under the former company name of "Funkwerk Enterprise Communications" - if running the BOSS operating system - are equally not affected by this vulnaerablity.

Package        : libupnp4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5958 CVE-2012-5959 CVE-2012-5960 CVE-2012-5961
                 CVE-2012-5962 CVE-2012-5963 CVE-2012-5964 CVE-2012-5965
Debian Bug     : 699459

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in libupnp4, a library
used for handling the Universal Plug and Play protocol. HD Moore from Rapid7
discovered that SSDP queries where not correctly handled by the
unique_service_name() function.

An attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on
libupnp4 could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to
the daemon crash and possible remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp4 packages.
