  "CVE-2012-5659": {
    "description": "An insufficient environment sanitization flaw was found in the way 'abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache' tool, performing installation of required debuginfo packages into ABRT's cache, of ABRT, an automatic bug detection and reporting tool, used the PYTHONPATH environment variable. A local attacker could provide a commonly used Python module with specially-crafted content in non-standard system location / path, which would lead into arbitrary Python code execution with privileges of the 'abrt' user, when the 'abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache' tool was run from the parent directory of the folder, containing the malicious module.",
    "root_cause": "The abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache tool did not sufficiently sanitize its environment variables, specifically the PYTHONPATH environment variable.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insufficient environment sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary Python code execution with privileges of the 'abrt' user, which could lead to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vector": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious python module in a non-standard location and execute the vulnerable tool from a specific directory.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when 'abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache' is run from the parent directory of the folder containing the malicious module."
