{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Missing CN (Common Name) validation of the CAS server certificate.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phpCAS library does not properly validate the CN of the SSL certificate when connecting to the CAS server. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to present a valid, but fake certificate, impersonating the CAS server."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where an attacker intercepts communication between the phpCAS client and the CAS server."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the CAS server, often on the same network or through DNS poisoning.  They must also be able to generate a valid SSL certificate for a domain name that matches the CAS server domain name."
    ],
     "details": "The vulnerability exists in phpCAS versions prior to 1.3.3, where the client does not validate the server's SSL certificate CN during HTTPS connection establishment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting up a rogue server impersonating the CAS server, with a valid certificate that does not match the correct CN, and tricking clients into connecting to it."
