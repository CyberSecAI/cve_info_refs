```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A race condition in the way ABRT handled directories used to store crash information.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Race condition leading to a symlink attack.
- Impact of exploitation: A local attacker with the privileges of the abrt user could make any file writable by the abrt user, leading to privilege escalation to root.
- Attack vectors: Local access.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the privileges of the 'abrt' user.
