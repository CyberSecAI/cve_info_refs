Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how MantisBT handles default access levels for workflow transitions. Specifically, the "Minimum Access Level to Change to this Status" setting in the workflow configuration did not have a proper default, causing it to potentially be set incorrectly to "viewer" when saving changes, even if the intended level was higher.  This occurred because the system would fall back to "viewer" instead of using the expected `$g_update_bug_status_threshold` or `$g_set_status_threshold`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Default Access Levels:** The system did not properly determine the default access level for status transitions, causing them to default to "viewer" instead of the intended level defined by `$g_update_bug_status_threshold` or `$g_set_status_threshold`.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could lead to unintended changes in the access levels that would allow users with lower access levels to change the status of issues which could then be used to discover information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Access Control Modification:**  Saving changes to workflow configuration could unintentionally lower the access levels required to transition issues between statuses.
-   **Potential Information Disclosure**: The incorrect access levels could allow users to access sensitive information that they were not intended to view.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the MantisBT web interface by accessing the workflow configuration settings.
-   **Configuration Modification:** An attacker would need the ability to access and modify the workflow configuration in MantisBT.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the necessary privileges to access and modify the workflow configuration.
-   **Project Level Access:**  The attacker would need access to the project or global configuration settings where the workflow is defined.
