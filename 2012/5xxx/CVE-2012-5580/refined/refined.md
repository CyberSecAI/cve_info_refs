{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "A format string vulnerability exists in the `proxy` command-line tool provided with libproxy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Format string vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially cause a crash or, if `FORTIFY_SOURCE` is not used, could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious HTTP proxy URL with format string specifiers.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `http_proxy` environment variable, which is used as input to the vulnerable `proxy` command-line tool.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to set the `http_proxy` environment variable and execute the `proxy` tool."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists only in the `proxy` tool, and not in the core libproxy library. The vulnerability is mitigated to a crash when `FORTIFY_SOURCE` is enabled. The bug was fixed in libproxy version 0.4.0, and it was addressed in Fedora 17 and newer, with an update pushed to Fedora 18 and Fedora 17. There is no plan to fix it in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6."
