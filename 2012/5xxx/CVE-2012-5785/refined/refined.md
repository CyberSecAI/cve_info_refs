  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the terrible design of the APIs to the underlying SSL libraries. Instead of expressing high-level security properties of network tunnels such as conﬁdentiality and authentication, these APIs expose low-level details of the SSL protocol to application developers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Badly designed APIs of SSL implementations (such as JSSE, OpenSSL, and GnuTLS) and data-transport libraries (such as cURL) which present developers with a confusing array of settings and options.",
        "Developers often use SSL APIs incorrectly, misinterpreting and misunderstanding their manifold parameters, options, side effects, and return values.",
        "Developers introducing new vulnerabilities when attempting to “fix” certiﬁcate validation bugs.",
        "Developers do not understand which security properties are or are not provided by a given SSL implementation.",
         "Intermediate layers of the software stack silently disabling certiﬁcate validation.",
        "Developers turning off certiﬁcate validation accidentally (e.g., for testing) or intentionally." ,
        "Using incorrect regular expressions for hostname matching.",
        "Not checking the results of certiﬁcate validation correctly.",
        "Accidentally or deliberately disabling validation."
      ],
      "impact": "Man-in-the-middle attacks can harvest credit card numbers, names, addresses, login credentials and other sensitive information. Affected programs include those responsible for managing cloud-based storage and computation, as well as merchant SDKs. Any SSL connection from any of these programs is insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Active network attacker who may control network routers or switches, Wi-Fi access points, and/or DNS.",
        "The attacker can mislead the client about the server’s network address (e.g., through DNS poisoning) and trick it into connecting to an attacker-controlled server instead."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not have access to the private keys of legitimate servers, does not control any certificate authorities, and cannot forge certificates. The attacker needs to control the network to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker also needs valid SSL certificates for the fake servers that they control to impersonate the legitimate servers."
