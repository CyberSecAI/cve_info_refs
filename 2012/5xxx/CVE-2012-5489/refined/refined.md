Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `get_request_var_or_attr` helper function of `App.Undo.UndoSupport` in Zope 2. This function, prior to specific fixes, could be exploited to access protected attributes of the context (the object in Zope that the code is operating on).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Attribute Access:** The core vulnerability is that `get_request_var_or_attr` did not properly restrict access to attributes, allowing an attacker to potentially retrieve and manipulate protected or private attributes.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The function failed to enforce proper access controls, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information contained within the object's protected attributes.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Access to internal attributes might enable further exploitation depending on the specific application.

**Attack Vectors:**

-  By manipulating the request in such a way that the vulnerable `get_request_var_or_attr` function would return protected attributes.
- The vulnerability is accessible to anyone who can make a request that triggers the affected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Zope application. This may require being an authenticated user depending on how the Zope application is setup.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Zope versions 2.12.21 and 2.13.11, released on 2011-12-12.
- The provided text does not provide exact details on the exploit vector, but it indicates that manipulating the request is the way to trigger the vulnerability.
- The issue is described as a "historical bug".

**Summary of CVE-2012-5489:**

The vulnerability is due to a flawed access control mechanism in the `get_request_var_or_attr` function of Zope 2's `App.Undo.UndoSupport`. This allowed attackers to bypass intended restrictions and gain access to protected attributes of objects, potentially leading to information disclosure and further exploitation. The vulnerability is fixed in Zope versions 2.12.21 and 2.13.11 and earlier versions are vulnerable.
