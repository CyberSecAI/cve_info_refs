- **Root cause of vulnerability:** JavaScript statements can break out of a `<script>` tag in the rendered response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If the JavaScript contains user-provided data, it could pose a security threat allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.
- **Attack vectors:** Injecting malicious JavaScript that breaks out of the intended `<script>` context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript, potentially through user-provided data, which the application doesn't properly sanitize.
