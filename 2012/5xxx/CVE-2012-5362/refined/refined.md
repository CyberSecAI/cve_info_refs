Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-5362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flood of ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the Windows operating system handles a large number of incoming ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages. This suggests a lack of proper rate limiting or resource management for processing these messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means that the targeted Windows system becomes unresponsive or significantly degraded in performance, affecting availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a flood of ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages to the vulnerable Windows system. This can likely be achieved via network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to send network packets to the targeted Windows machine. This could involve being on the same local network or having the ability to send packets over the internet, depending on network configurations. The attacker does not appear to need any specific authentication or privileges to launch the attack.
