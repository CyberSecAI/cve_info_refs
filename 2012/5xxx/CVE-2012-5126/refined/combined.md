## [Stable Channel Release and Beta Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2012/11/stable-channel-release-and-beta-channel.html "Stable Channel Release and Beta Channel Update")

Tuesday, November 6, 2012

****The Chrome team is excited to announce the release of Chrome 23 to the Stable Channel.****23.0.1271.64** **for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome Frame.** **Chrome 23 contains a number of new features including GPU accelerated video decoding on Windows and easier website permissions****.** **More detailed updates are available on the [Chrome Blog](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/11/longer-battery-life-and-easier-website.html).****

**Security fixes and rewards:

Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

Occasionally, we issue special rewards for bugs outside of Chrome, particularly where the bug is very severe and/or we are able to partially work around the issue:**

 **And back to your regular scheduled rewards, including some at the new higher levels:
