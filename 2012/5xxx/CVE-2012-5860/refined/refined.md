The provided content is related to a vulnerability in Oberthur smart cards but it is not assigned a CVE ID. The content is related to VU#659615

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Oberthur ID-One COSMO 64, v5.2 and v5.2a smart cards generate public keys that do not comply with the Digital Signature Standard (FIPS PUB 186-3).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Generation of weak public keys that do not satisfy the requirements of the Digital Signature Standard

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker may be able to compromise the integrity of the smart card identity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is not explicitly stated but it would likely involve exploiting the weakness in the generated public keys after obtaining access to them or a service using them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to take advantage of the weak public key, which would likely require access to the smart card or its output.
- The CVSS vector indicates that the attack requires physical access (AV:L) and is difficult to exploit (AC:H).
