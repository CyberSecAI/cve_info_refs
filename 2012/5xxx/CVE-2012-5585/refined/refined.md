Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5585:

**CVE Description:** The provided text indicates that CVE-2012-5585 is assigned to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Mixpanel module for Drupal.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is that the Mixpanel module does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a webpage viewed by other users. This code can potentially:
  - Steal sensitive information (cookies, session tokens).
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Deface the website.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious code into the Mixpanel module's settings or data fields. When the module displays this data on a webpage, the malicious script will execute within the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to inject code into the Mixpanel settings/data fields. This might require administrative or content management privileges, or through exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow them to inject data.

   - The attacker can be an authenticated user with the necessary permissions or an unauthenticated user if another vulnerability allows them to inject data.

**Additional Details:** This information comes from a message on the oss-security mailing list, where a CVE ID request is being processed. The original request refers to Drupal's security advisory for this vulnerability SA-CONTRIB-2012-167.
