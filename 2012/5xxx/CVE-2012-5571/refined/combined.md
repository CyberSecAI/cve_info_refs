Ensures User is member of tenant in ec2 validation

```
It is possible that a user is no longer a member of a tenant when
they attempt to use an ec2 token. This checks to make sure that
the user still has at least one valid role in the tenant before
authenticating them. This should automatically work for the s3
version as well since it is a subclass.

Fixes bug 1064914

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

## What we do:

* [Incident response](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerability-management)

Ensures User is member of tenant in ec2 validation

```
It is possible that a user is no longer a member of a tenant when
they attempt to use an ec2 token. This checks to make sure that
the user still has at least one valid role in the tenant before
authenticating them. This should automatically work for the s3
version as well since it is a subclass.

Fixes bug 1064914

### Bug Description

Was: (Able to access ec2 resources with out a user-role)

Steps to reproduce:

1.I have created a user,tenant and ec2 credentials using keystone and didnt associated a role

then try to run

$ euca-describe-images

Unauthorized: Failure communicating with keystone2

2.then associated a role to the user

$keystone user-role-add --user-id ee32bff3e1524a2b82fe804aac0ce682 --tenant-id cf38a72df8a14bb8984c699edfceb1c3 --role-id 26760c0f9ed045fcb70112f7b16813b3

3.then again I ran

$ euca-describe-images

IMAGE ami-00000002 None (cirros-0.3.0-x86\_64-uec) 597b866b450d491f889b9432a564e9a9 available public machineaki-00000001 ari-00000003 instance-store

IMAGE ari-00000003 None (cirros-0.3.0-x86\_64-uec-ramdisk) 597b866b450d491f889b9432a564e9a9 available public ramdisk instance-store

IMAGE aki-00000001 None (cirros-0.3.0-x86\_64-uec-kernel) 597b866b450d491f889b9432a564e9a9 available public kernel instance-store

4.remove the user-role

keystone user-role-delete --user-id ee32bff3e1524a2b82fe804aac0ce682 --tenant-id cf38a72df8a14bb8984c699edfceb1c3 --role-id 26760c0f9ed045fcb70112f7b16813b3

5.now the user doesn't have any role associated,now again run

 $ euca-describe-images

IMAGE ami-00000002 None (cirros-0.3.0-x86\_64-uec) 597b866b450d491f889b9432a564e9a9 available public machineaki-00000001 ari-00000003 instance-store

IMAGE ari-00000003 None (cirros-0.3.0-x86\_64-uec-ramdisk) 597b866b450d491f889b9432a564e9a9 available public ramdisk instance-store

IMAGE aki-00000001 None (cirros-0.3.0-x86\_64-uec-kernel) 597b866b450d491f889b9432a564e9a9 available public kernel instance-store

here user should get the message as in step 2 but it was successful.

not sure if this is a bug with keystone or ec2.

If confirmed, it's in the "extension of validity" class like the ones where you could extend the lifetime of a token. A bit hard to exploit (since you need to be given the role in the first place) but definitely needs to be fixed. I would issue an OSSA on this for the same reason we issued one on the previous token issues.

The EC2 mechanisms disregard role entirely, and work from the relationship of the user to the tenant. If that relationship didn't exist, the user shouldn't be able to access the tenant's resources through EC2. WIth the V2 API, just associating a user with a tenant is an implicit "membership" role - and in fact that's how Horizon displays this information.

Actual "roles" as Keystone defines them are irrelevant to the EC2 credential access, and with the V2 API's and the EC2 mechanisms, roles have no function there. They're not checked as a form of RBAC for allowing EC2 credential access.

The V3 API is aiming to clean this up a bit, more for the OpenStack API. V3 API changes does not currently specify any RBAC around EC2 credential authority.

ok tracked this down and verified. The other bug above is separate, but this one still occurs. I managed to successfuly delete the role and the ec2 commands still work. This is because in the ec2 credentials we are storing the user and tenant. We should fix this by adding a check in the ec2 authenticate to make sure that the user still has a valid role before validating.

So if I get this straight, the issue is that if a user has a role that makes it associated with a tenant, but then that role is removed, the token is still valid. That would make it part of the "extension of validity" class I mentioned above, which we considered in the past as worthy of an advisory.

If confirmed, I'll prepare an impact statement.

Vish's folsom-backport tag probably means that Folsom is also affected. What about Essex at first glance ?

Ensures User is member of tenant in ec2 validation

It is possible that a user is no longer a member of a tenant when

    they attempt to use an ec2 token. This checks to make sure that

    the user still has at least one valid role in the tenant before

    authenticating them. This should automatically work for the s3

    version as well since it is a subclass.

@Russell: we have a precedent for issuing after-the-fact OSSA on this kind of thing. Do you think we should here ? If yes, maybe we can give a few days warning to the stakeholders while we work on the impact statement ?

Would be good to push an Essex backport for this as well -- CCing stable/essex team

Proposed impact description:

Title: EC2-style credentials invalidation issue

Reporter: Vijaya Erukala

Products: Keystone

Affects: All versions

Description:

Vijaya Erukala reported a vulnerability in Keystone EC2-style credentials invalidation: when a user is removed from a tenant, issued EC2-style credentials would continue to be valid for that tenant. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the account owner expectations. Only setups enabling EC2-style credentials (for example enabling EC2 API in Nova) are affected.

# USN-1641-1: OpenStack Keystone vulnerabilities

28 November 2012

Keystone would allow unintended access to files over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [keystone](/security/cves?package=keystone) - OpenStack identity service

## Details

Vijaya Erukala discovered that Keystone did not properly invalidate

EC2-style credentials such that if credentials were removed from a tenant,

an authenticated and authorized user using those credentials may still be

allowed access beyond the account owner's expectations. ([CVE-2012-5571](/security/CVE-2012-5571))

It was discovered that Keystone did not properly implement token

expiration. A remote attacker could use this to continue to access an

account that is disabled or has a changed password. This issue was

previously fixed as [CVE-2012-3426](/security/CVE-2012-3426) but was reintroduced in Ubuntu 12.10.

([CVE-2012-5563](/security/CVE-2012-5563))

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [python-keystone](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone)
  -
  [2012.2-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone/2012.2-0ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python-keystone](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/keystone)

Subject: [OSSA 2012-018] EC2-style credentials invalidation issue (CVE-2012-5571)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2012-018
CVE: CVE-2012-5571
Date: November 28, 2012
Title: EC2-style credentials invalidation issue
Reporter: Vijaya Erukala
Products: Keystone
Affects: All versions

Description:
Vijaya Erukala reported a vulnerability in Keystone EC2-style
credentials invalidation: when a user is removed from a tenant, issued
EC2-style credentials would continue to be valid for that tenant. An
authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage this
vulnerability to extend his access beyond the account owner
expectations. Only setups enabling EC2-style credentials (for example
enabling EC2 API in Nova) are affected.

Grizzly (development branch) fix:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1556)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Essex.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2012.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#867029)

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was found that Keystone did not correctly handle users being removed
from tenants when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) style
credentials (credentials that are issued in the same format as standard
Amazon EC2 credentials) were in use. When a user was removed from a tenant,
they retained the privileges provided by that tenant, allowing them to
access resources they should no longer have access to. (CVE-2012-5571)

When access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) was configured,
a file permissions flaw in Keystone allowed a local attacker to view the
administrative access and secret values used for authenticating requests to
Amazon EC2 services. An attacker could use this flaw to access Amazon EC2
and enable, disable, and modify services and settings. (CVE-2012-5483)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2012-5571. Upstream acknowledges Vijaya Erukala as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-5571. The CVE-2012-5483 issue was discovered by Kurt
Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After
installing the updated packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone)
will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

Ensures User is member of tenant in ec2 validation

```
It is possible that a user is no longer a member of a tenant when
they attempt to use an ec2 token. This checks to make sure that
the user still has at least one valid role in the tenant before
authenticating them. This should automatically work for the s3
version as well since it is a subclass.

Fixes bug 1064914

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Moderate: openstack-keystone security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1557)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2012.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#883829)

This update also fixes the following security issues:

A flaw in Keystone allowed an attacker with access to the web and network
interfaces to continue using chained tokens linked to tokens that had
expired. This would allow the attacker to continue using the tokens despite
the parent token being expired, giving them continued access to OpenStack
services. (CVE-2012-5563)

It was found that Keystone did not correctly handle users being removed
from tenants when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) style
credentials (credentials that are issued in the same format as standard
Amazon EC2 credentials) were in use. When a user was removed from a tenant,
they retained the privileges provided by that tenant, allowing them to
access resources they should no longer have access to. (CVE-2012-5571)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Anndy as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-5563, and Vijaya Erukala as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-5571.

All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After
installing the updated packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone)
will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

Subject: [OSSA 2012-019] Extension of token validity through token chaining
 (CVE-2012-5563)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2012-019
CVE: CVE-2012-5563
Date: November 28, 2012
Title: Extension of token validity through token chaining
Reporter: Anndy
Products: Keystone
Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:
Anndy reported a vulnerability in token chaining in Keystone. A token
expiration date can be circumvented by creating a new token before the
old one has expired. An authenticated and authorized user could
potentially leverage this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the
account owner expectations. Note: this vulnerability was fixed in the
past (CVE-2012-3426) but was reintroduced in Folsom when code was
refactored to support PKI tokens.

Grizzly (development branch) fix:
<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/38c7e46a640a94da4da89a39a5a1ea9c081f1eb5>

Folsom fix (included in upcoming Keystone 2012.2.1 stable update):
<https://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/f9d4766249a72d8f88d75dcf1575b28dd3496681>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
