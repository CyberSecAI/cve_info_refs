There are some, which are potentially affected, but where discussion
with upstream is still pending.

Shall we go ahead and post them or do you prefer to have them sorted
out with upstream first?

CURLOPT\_SSL\_VERIFYHOST should be set to 2 not to 1.

From the libcurl documentation:

> When CURLOPT\_SSL\_VERIFYHOST is 2, that certificate must indicate that the
>
> server is the server to which you meant to connect, or the connection fails.
>
> Curl considers the server the intended one when the Common Name field or a
>
> Subject Alternate Name field in the certificate matches the host name in the
>
> URL to which you told Curl to connect.
>
> When the value is 1, the certificate must contain a Common Name field, but it
>
> doesn't matter what name it says. (This is not ordinarily a useful setting).

Thanks for ghedo from debian.org for reporting.

| The patch makes sense but there is an error in the patch and existing code in my view. The "else" an explicit "no verification of the SSL connection (cert/host)" that is requested by the user so it should be 0 for the HOST\_VERIFY. I guess it's not used anyway and could simply be removed all together.  I also think we should have an option to only verify the SSL cert but skip the HOST verification. |

| I have commited a patch to fix this issue. I have tested the solution locally and it works.  The commit also includes an example how to fall back to the old (unsafe) implementation if necessary. The new default is a full CN validation of the SSL certificate.  Any feedback is welcome. The only "ugly" thing was changing the RequestInterface. Maybe [@adamfranco](https://github.com/adamfranco) has some ideas or opinions? |

| Adding the optional parameter to the interface seems OK since in theory the extra validation should be done by any request-handling method, not just CURL. The only change needed is that I think the interface should define the parameter as optional to avoid PHP strict notices. |

Note that curl is the (unaffected) command line tool based on libcurl.
The CVEs should probably refer to insecure usage of libcurl to prevent

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage
