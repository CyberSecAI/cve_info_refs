**oCERT-2012-001 multiple implementations denial-of-service via MurmurHash algorithm collision**

**Description**:

A variety of programming languages suffer from a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition against storage functions of key/value pairs in hash data structures,
the condition can be leveraged by exploiting predictable collisions in the
underlying hashing algorithms.

The issue is similar to the one reported in [oCERT-2011-003](ocert-2011-003.html)
and concerns the MurmurHash algorithm family. The condition for predictable collisions in the hashing functions has
been reported for the following language implementations:
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) (MurmurHash2),
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) (MurmurHash2),
[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/) (MurmurHash3),
[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase) (MurmurHash),
[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) (MurmurHash).
In the case of Java OpenJDK the hash function affected by the reported
issue is not enabled by default, the default function is however reported vulnerable to
[oCERT-2011-003](ocert-2011-003.html).

**Affected version**:

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) < 1.9.3-p327

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) < 1.7.1

[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), all versions

[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase) <= 7

[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) <= 7

**Fixed version**:

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) >= 1.9.3-p327

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) >= 1.7.1

[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), N/A (see References for patch commited to development branch)

[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase), N/A

[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net), N/A

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=880705#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-27 16:08:09 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the Murmur hash function implementation, as being used by various Java implementations. A specially-crafted set of keys could trigger Murmur hash function collisions, which degrade hash table items insert performance by changing hash table operations complexity from an expected/average O(n) to the worst case O(n^2). Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using equivalent substrings.  As various web application frameworks for Java automatically pre-fill certain arrays with data from the HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters) for Java web applications, a remote attacker could use this flaw to make the Java virtual machine to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with a large number parameters which hash to the same value.  A different vulnerability than [CVE-2012-2739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2739).
