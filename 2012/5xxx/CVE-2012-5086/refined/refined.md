Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5086:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2012-5086. This CVE ID is consistently mentioned in the Red Hat Bugzilla entries, Oracle advisories, Hitachi information, and mailing list discussions. The vulnerability description, relating to XMLDecoder access control checks, also matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is an insufficient access control check in the `com.sun.beans.decoder.PropertyElementHandler` class, utilized by Java Beans XMLDecoder. This lack of proper checks allows certain actions to be performed that should be restricted.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The primary weakness is the failure of the `PropertyElementHandler` to perform adequate access control checks when processing XML data. This allows for the possibility of bypassing Java sandbox restrictions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. 
   - This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process or applet, and potentially enable actions that are normally not allowed within a sandboxed environment.
   - Impact includes the possibility of data disclosure and a loss of system confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The primary attack vector is through untrusted Java applications or applets. An attacker could provide crafted XML input that takes advantage of the insufficient access controls of the XMLDecoder.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - An attacker needs to be able to execute an untrusted Java application or applet on a vulnerable system. This could be achieved by luring users to visit malicious web pages hosting compromised applets or by deploying malicious standalone applications.
   - No specific position on a network seems required, as the attack may be executed remotely.

**Additional Details:**
   - The Oracle advisory specifies that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, emphasizing that an attacker can exploit this flaw over a network without needing user credentials.
   - The identified attack vectors specifically target client deployment of Java (untrusted applets and Java Web Start), but may also apply to server deployments where XMLDecoder processes attacker-controlled data.
   - The vulnerability is addressed in various vendor patches, including Oracle's JDK 7u9 and 6u37, IcedTea 6 and 7, and IBM's Java releases.
