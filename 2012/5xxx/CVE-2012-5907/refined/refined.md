- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization within the `json.php` script in TomatoCart, specifically when processing the `module` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `module` parameter passed to `json.php`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use the LFI vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, which can expose sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or system files.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to `json.php` with the `module` parameter containing directory traversal characters (e.g., `../../`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running the vulnerable TomatoCart instance. No special privileges are required.
