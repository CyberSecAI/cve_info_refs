 Yes, had it fixes for both parts listed from the start, there would
be no problem. The problem is the confusion over where CVE-2012-5645
is really fixed. Based on the original description here some
distributions claim CVE-2012-5645 fixed now that they have applied one
patch only. If you just add second fix to CVE-2012-5645, there will be
no way of telling if particular logmsg about "CVE-2012-5645 fixed"
means it's fixed completely, or only half of it.

Hmm I'm waffling here. The issues are the same version/reporter,
roughly the same, can you post the <http://cwe.mitre.org/> identifiers
for these two issues? If they are different enough this might warrant
a CVE split but for now I'm leaving it merged.

 That's two issues...

 ... reported in one freeciv ticket.

 That CVE is a bit unfortunate that it (currently) has description
containing both parts but fix provided is only one part. I think it's
quite likely that they will assign new CVE for the other half to sort
this out.

Freeciv maintainers,
it's been two months. Can you please upload a fixed package?

For the avoidance of doubt (sorry if you knew this):

No-one you've emailed directly is a Debian maintainer (Marko is
upstream).

We (upstream) made a new release fixing both [CVE-2012-5645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5645) and
[CVE-2012-6083](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6083) on 8th Dec (2.3.3). Since then we've made another release
(2.3.4 on 16th Feb). See #699296 where I request that Debian take these
updates into at least unstable.

Hi,
As the last uploader sorry about not getting involved in this. I am not currently about to commit to helping with this but now I have seen the bugs I will try and find time in the next few weeks. I appreciate this will be to late for the release.
Thanks,

Package: freeciv

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.8) - use target "oldstable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

Thanks,

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Please continue to use CVE-2012-5645 for
<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21701>
Added return value indicating success or failure for all dio_get_xxx()
functions, and check that value to avoid infinite loop in reading arrays
from network when there's no more data even though it's expected.

For
<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21672>
Sanity check packet length received over network against values
less than header length alone to avoid situation where body length
is considered negative.

Please use CVE-2012-6083 for this issue.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

Subject: About CVE-2012-5645

I saw message that Freeciv bug #20003 has been assigned
CVE-2012-5645 : <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q4/484>

I'd like to clarify things a bit. It was not single issue, but more
like two separate issues. Most importantly this leads to patch listed
(<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21670>) to
fix only part of the problems described. Something like:

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the server component
of Freeciv, a turn-based, multi-player, X based strategy game,
processed certain packets (invalid packets with whole packet
length lower than packet header size). A
remote attacker could send a specially-crafted packet that, when
processed would lead to freeciv server to terminate (due to memory
exhaustion)

The other half:
A denial of service flaw was found in the way the server component
of Freeciv, a turn-based, multi-player, X based strategy game,
processed certain packets (syntactically valid
packets, but whose processing would lead to an infinite loop). A
remote attacker could send a specially-crafted packet that, when
processed would lead to freeciv server to become unresponsive (due to
excessive CPU use).

is fixed in
<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21701>

 Both are fixed in 2.3.3 (and patch versions applied to the stable
branch S2_3 release was made from:
<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21672> ,
<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21703> )

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=888331#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-18 14:07:52 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way the server component of Freeciv, a turn-based, multi-player, X based strategy game, processed certain packets (invalid packets with whole packet length lower than packet header size or syntactically valid packets, but whose processing would lead to an infinite loop). A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted packet that, when processed would lead to freeciv server to terminate (due to memory exhaustion) or become unresponsive (due to excessive CPU use).
