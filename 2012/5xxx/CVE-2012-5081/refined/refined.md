Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) SSL/TLS implementation not properly handling handshake records with overly large data length values. This occurs within the OpenJDK component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient input validation:** The JSSE implementation fails to validate the data length field in handshake records, making it susceptible to malformed packets.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can exploit the lack of data length validation to cause an exception on the SSL/TLS server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack can cause an SSL/TLS server to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can send a malformed SSL/TLS handshake record to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the target SSL/TLS server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, as it exists in the initial handshake process, which doesn't require prior authentication.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this remotely, without having any local access to the system.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in several updates including OpenJDK (IcedTea6 and IcedTea7), Oracle JDK 7u9 and 6u37, and IBM Java SE.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple products and systems, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and various Cosminexus products.
*   Red Hat has assigned a base CVSS score of 5.0 for the vulnerability which indicates a medium severity.
*   Some of the content provides specific patch instructions using package managers like `zypper` (for openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise) and `yum` or Red Hat Network (for Red Hat Enterprise Linux), along with specific package names which were updated to resolve this and other vulnerabilities
*   The Red Hat Security team rated the vulnerability with "Important" or "Critical" impact, which is higher than the medium severity assigned by CVSS.
*   The description indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by an "unauthenticated, remote attacker".
*   The fix requires that running instances of Java on the affected systems be restarted.
