RHSA-2013:1853 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2013-12-17
Updated:
2013-12-17
# RHSA-2013:1853 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0, which fixes multiple security
issues and several bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that
provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss
Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

This JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 release serves as a replacement for
JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to
the JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 Release Notes for information on the
most significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available
shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/>

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
protected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
prevention filter. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform CSRF
attacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter and do
not contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
XML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Operations
Network installation (including its databases, applications, configuration
files, the JBoss Operations Network server's file system directory, and so
on).

All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your
existing JBoss Operations Network installation (including its databases,
applications, configuration files, the JBoss Operations Network server's
file system directory, and so on).

Refer to the JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 Release Notes for
installation information.

* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: jakarta-commons-httpclient security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0680)

## Topic

An updated jakarta-commons-httpclient package for JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one security issue is now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component can be used to build HTTP-aware
client applications (such as web browsers and web service clients).

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated
package. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-12 10:12:23 UTC  ``` It was reported that Elasticsearch versions 1.3.0-1.3.7 and 1.4.0-1.4.2 have vulnerabilities in the Groovy scripting engine. The vulnerability allows an attacker to construct Groovy scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM.  Upstream bug report: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9655>  Upstream fixes: 1.3: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/69735b0f4ab9ad7df4b82e8c917589b52cb9978c> 1.4: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/4e952b2d75de6ca4caf4b6743462714f3b60d07f> 1.x: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/716f0b24dc5414616e8dc0590dbfcfa0081be892>  Mitigation: Users can address the vulnerability by setting script.groovy.sandbox.enabled to false in config/elasticsearch.yml and restarting the node.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-10 14:13:15 UTC  ``` Upstream announcement of fixed versions 1.3.8 and 1.4.3 which describes the issue: <http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/elasticsearch-1-4-3-and-1-3-8-released/>  Those versions address the issue by disallowing the use of Groovy for dynamic scripting rather than fixing the sandbox bypass.  The following upstream blog post describes how to use scripts stored in Elasticsearch (indexed script) or on disk: <http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/running-groovy-scripts-without-dynamic-scripting/>  This blog post describes how to exploit this issue: <https://jordan-wright.github.io/blog/2015/03/08/elasticsearch-rce-vulnerability-cve-2015-1427/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-10 14:19:02 UTC  ``` This issue has similar impact to [CVE-2014-3120](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3120) ([bug 1124252](show_bug.cgi?id=1124252 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3120 elasticsearch: remote code execution flaw via dynamic scripting")), adjusting impact rating accordingly.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-04-03 21:02:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2017:0868 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0868](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0868)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-02 15:51:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2017:0868 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0868](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0868)   ``` |  |

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

RHSA-2013:0679 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2013-03-25
# RHSA-2013:0679 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: jakarta-commons-httpclient security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one
security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component can be used to build HTTP-aware
client applications (such as web browsers and web service clients).

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 as provided from
the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

# RHSA-2017:0868 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R2 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was reported that Elasticsearch had vulnerabilities in the Groovy scripting engine, which allow an attacker to construct scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM. (CVE-2015-1427)
* It was found that a flaw in Apache groovy library allows remote code execution wherever deserialization occurs in the application. It is possible for an attacker to craft a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability. (CVE-2016-6814)
* It was found that Apache Commons HttpClient does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. (CVE-2012-5783)
* It was found that swagger-ui contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the key names in the JSON document. An attacker could use this flaw to supply a key name with script tags which could cause arbitrary code execution. Additionally it is possible to load the arbitrary JSON files remotely via the URL query-string parameter. (CVE-2016-1000229)
* A vulnerability was found in FormattedServiceListWriter in Apache CXF HTTP transport module that could allow an attacker to inject unexpected matrix parameters into the request URL. On a successful injection these matrix parameters will find their way back to the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client. (CVE-2016-6812)
* Apache CXF JAX-RS implementation provides a number of Atom MessageBodyReaders. These readers use Apache Abdera Parser to parse Atom feeds or Entries, with this Parser expanding XML entities by default. It was found that this represents a major XXE risk. (CVE-2016-8739)
* A path traversal issue was found in Spark version 2.5 and potentially earlier versions. The vulnerability resides in the functionality to serve static files where there's no protection against directory traversal attacks. This could allow attackers access to private files including sensitive data. (CVE-2016-9177)
* It was found that the camel-snakeyaml component is exploitable for code execution. An attacker could use this vulnerability to send specially crafted payload to a camel-snakeyaml endpoint and causing a remote code execution attack. (CVE-2017-3159)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

## Synopsis

Moderate: jakarta-commons-httpclient security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0270)

## Topic

Updated jakarta-commons-httpclient packages that fix one security issue are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component can be used to build HTTP-aware
client applications (such as web browsers and web service clients).

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

All users of jakarta-commons-httpclient are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct this issue. Applications using the Jakarta
Commons HttpClient component must be restarted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

# USN-2769-1: Apache Commons HttpClient vulnerabilities

14 October 2015

Several security issues were fixed in commons-httpclient.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [commons-httpclient](/security/cves?package=commons-httpclient) - A Java(TM) library for creating HTTP clients

## Details

It was discovered that Apache Commons HttpClient did not properly verify the

Common Name or subjectAltName fields of X.509 certificates. An attacker could

exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive

information or alter encrypted communications. This issue only affected Ubuntu

12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-5783](/security/CVE-2012-5783))

Florian Weimer discovered the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](/security/CVE-2012-5783) was incomplete for Apache

Commons HttpClient. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive information or alter

encrypted communications. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-6153](/security/CVE-2012-6153))

Subodh Iyengar and Will Shackleton discovered the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](/security/CVE-2012-5783) was

incomplete for Apache Commons HttpClient. An attacker could exploit this to

perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive information or alter

encrypted communications. ([CVE-2014-3577](/security/CVE-2014-3577))

It was discovered that Apache Commons HttpClient did not properly handle read

timeouts during HTTPS handshakes. A remote attacker could trigger this flaw to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5262](/security/CVE-2015-5262))

## Synopsis

Moderate: jakarta-commons-httpclient security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0682)

## Topic

An updated jakarta-commons-httpclient package for JBoss Enterprise Web
Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one security issue is now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component can be used to build HTTP-aware
client applications (such as web browsers and web service clients).

The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and
configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package. The JBoss
server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

#### Description

See.

<http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf>

Using JSSE you must manually validate server name you're connecting to matches one of the names provided by the certificate. So you can detect a man-in-the-middle type attack with a valid certificado for other site.

# Red Hat Access: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Plug-in

Updated 2014-07-29T19:07:35+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

## Benefits

The Red Hat Access plug-in for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization is a feature which offers seamless integrated access to Red Hat Access services from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Administration Portal. The plug-in provides automated functionality that enables quicker help, answers, and proactive services. It offers easy and instant access to Red Hat exclusive knowledge, resources, engagement, and diagnostic features.

Subscribers that install this plug-in will enjoy the following Red Hat Access services from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Administration Portal:

- Create, manage, and update your Red Hat support cases.

- Conveniently access exclusive Red Hat knowledge and solutions.

- Search error codes, messages, etc. and view related knowledge from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

- Diagnose events.

- View and diagnose log files.

## Installation

The plug-in is a dependency for all versions >= RHEVM 3.3. Therefore it will be installed by default when installing RHEVM.

## Usage

### Login

The plug-in allows access to exclusive Red Hat features through custom Red Hat Access tabs and menu items. Subscribers must log in using their [Red Hat login](https://access.redhat.com/site/help/login_assistance) credentials to enable services. It should be noted that the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Administration Portal credentials are not the same as a user's Red Hat Login.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/login_2.png)

After logging in, exclusive Red Hat Access features will be enabled. Users will now see their Red Hat id in the upper right corner of all Red Hat Access tabs and panels. Logging out from Red Hat will not log the user out of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Administration Portal.

## Search

One important benefit of Red Hat Access is the ability to access all of the knowledge in the Red Hat Customer Portal seamlessly from within Administration Portal. This feature is available in the lower tabs and some context menu's throughout the Administration Portal.

The image below demonstrates how a user can type keywords, error codes, or log messages into the search bar and receive exclusive Red Hat knowledge seamlessly in the product. The query results are displayed in a left hand navigation list and, once clicked, can be viewed in the right panel.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/search_1.png)

The plug-in also features the ability to get to Red Hat Access services from various context menus within the Administration Portal.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/rightclick_1.png)

Upon selecting Red Hat Access from the context menu, the user is presented with a modal dialog with the ability to search solutions.

### Support Case Management

The plug-in makes it easy for subscribers to engage Red Hat Support when necessary. From the modal dialog simply click the 'Open/Edit Support Case' button in the upper right corner. This action will take the user to a menu where they have the ability to either create a new support case or modify an existing support case.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/redhataccess_1.png)

The plug-in knows which log files, config files, and other data that support engineers generally need to see to assist in the resolution of an issue and, it will automatically attach them to a support case.

Administration Portal users can include logs from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, include the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager's database, include SoS reports from hypervisors, or, optionally, include any other file which may be relevant to the support case. The user is always has full control over the data that is provided to Red Hat and can decide what to send and what to omit.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/opennewcase_0.png)

The "Modify Case" radio button will present the user with a list of the support cases they have open with Red Hat. From this dialog, users can read the support case comments, add new comments, attach files, and change the state of the support case.

There are convenience check boxes in this dialog which allow a user to attach the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager's database, a "SOS Report" from the manager, or SoS reports from the hypervisor(s). In addition, the user has the option to attach an arbitrary file.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/modifycase_1.png)

### Documentation

The plug-in also offers Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization product documentation in the lower tabs of the Administration Portal via the Red Hat Documentation tab. This tab will automatically skip to the section of the product documentation which is relevant to that active Administration Portal view.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/documentation.png)

### Event Diagnosis

The Events main tab also supports Red Hat Diagnosing an event. To perform the Red Hat Diagnosis, right-click the event and select "Red Hat Access: Diagnose". During the diagnose the event along with meta-data is sent to Red Hat's diagnostic servers.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/eventdiagnose.png)

After selecting "Red Hat Access: Diagnose" a modal dialog is opened displaying the most relevant solutions.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/eventrecommendations.png)

### Log Viewer

The plug-in also supports a Log Viewer to view logs on both the RHEV Manager and the Manager's host machines. To use the Log Viewer, select a machine from the drop-down in the upper left corner of the view. Once a machine is selected, the machine's log files are displayed in the left pane. To view a file, highlight the file and click "Select File". Once selected, the file will be displayed in a tab in the viewer.

![Drawing](https://access.redhat.com/site/sites/default/files/images/logviewer.png)

The Log Viewer also supports Red Hat Diagnosing snippets from log files. To perform the Red Hat Diagnose first highlight the desired text. Next, click the Red Hat Diagnose button, this will send the text to Red Hat's Diagnostic servers. The user is then returned with relevant solutions.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

ABSTRACT
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the de facto standard for secure In-
ternet communications. Security of SSL connections against an
active network attacker depends on correctly validating public-key
certiﬁcates presented when the connection is established.

We demonstrate that SSL certiﬁcate validation is completely bro-
ken in many security-critical applications and libraries. Vulnerable
software includes Amazon’s EC2 Java library and all cloud clients
based on it; Amazon’s and PayPal’s merchant SDKs responsible
for transmitting payment details from e-commerce sites to payment
gateways; integrated shopping carts such as osCommerce, ZenCart,
Ubercart, and PrestaShop; AdMob code used by mobile websites;
Chase mobile banking and several other Android apps and libraries;
Java Web-services middleware—including Apache Axis, Axis 2,
Codehaus XFire, and Pusher library for Android—and all applica-
tions employing this middleware. Any SSL connection from any of
these programs is insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

The root causes of these vulnerabilities are badly designed APIs
of SSL implementations (such as JSSE, OpenSSL, and GnuTLS)
and data-transport libraries (such as cURL) which present devel-
opers with a confusing array of settings and options. We analyze
perils and pitfalls of SSL certiﬁcate validation in software based on
these APIs and present our recommendations.

cations. The main purpose of SSL is to provide end-to-end security
against an active, man-in-the-middle attacker. Even if the network
is completely compromised—DNS is poisoned, access points and
routers are controlled by the adversary, etc.—SSL is intended to
guarantee conﬁdentiality, authenticity, and integrity for communi-
cations between the client and the server.

Authenticating the server is a critical part of SSL connection es-
tablishment.1 This authentication takes place during the SSL hand-
shake, when the server presents its public-key certiﬁcate. In order
for the SSL connection to be secure, the client must carefully verify
that the certiﬁcate has been issued by a valid certiﬁcate authority,
has not expired (or been revoked), the name(s) listed in the certiﬁ-
cate match(es) the name of the domain that the client is connecting
to, and perform several other checks [14, 15].

SSL implementations in Web browsers are constantly evolving
through “penetrate-and-patch” testing, and many SSL-related vul-
nerabilities in browsers have been repaired over the years. SSL,
however, is also widely used in non-browser software whenever
secure Internet connections are needed. For example, SSL is used
for (1) remotely administering cloud-based virtual infrastructure
and sending local data to cloud-based storage, (2) transmitting cus-
tomers’ payment details from e-commerce servers to payment pro-
cessors such as PayPal and Amazon, (3) logging instant messenger
clients into online services, and (4) authenticating servers to mobile
applications on Android and iOS.

These programs usually do not implement SSL themselves. In-
stead, they rely on SSL libraries such as OpenSSL, GnuTLS, JSSE,
CryptoAPI, etc., as well as higher-level data-transport libraries,
such as cURL, Apache HttpClient, and urllib, that act as wrappers
around SSL libraries. In software based on Web services, there is
an additional layer of abstraction introduced by Web-services mid-
dleware such as Apache Axis, Axis 2, or Codehaus XFire.

Our contributions. We present an in-depth study of SSL connec-
tion authentication in non-browser software, focusing on how di-
verse applications and libraries on Linux, Windows, Android, and
iOS validate SSL server certiﬁcates. We use both white- and black-
box techniques to discover vulnerabilities in validation logic. Our
main conclusion is that SSL certiﬁcate validation is completely bro-
ken in many critical software applications and libraries. When
presented with self-signed and third-party certiﬁcates—including
a certiﬁcate issued by a legitimate authority to a domain called
AllYourSSLAreBelongTo.us —they establish SSL connec-
tions and send their secrets to a man-in-the-middle attacker.

1SSL also supports client authentication, but we do not analyze it
in this paper.

This is exactly the attack that SSL is intended to protect against.
It does not involve compromised or malicious certiﬁcate authori-
ties, nor forged certiﬁcates, nor compromised private keys of legit-
imate servers. The only class of vulnerabilities we exploit are logic
errors in client-side SSL certiﬁcate validation.

The root cause of most of these vulnerabilities is the terrible de-
sign of the APIs to the underlying SSL libraries.
Instead of ex-
pressing high-level security properties of network tunnels such as
conﬁdentiality and authentication, these APIs expose low-level de-
tails of the SSL protocol to application developers. As a conse-
quence, developers often use SSL APIs incorrectly, misinterpreting
and misunderstanding their manifold parameters, options, side ef-
fects, and return values. In several cases, we observed developers
introducing new vulnerabilities when attempting to “ﬁx” certiﬁcate
validation bugs. Furthermore, deveopers often do not understand
which security properties are or are not provided by a given SSL
implementation: for example, they use SSL libraries that do not
validate certiﬁcates even when security is essential (e.g., connect-
ing to a payment processor). More prosaic, yet deadly causes in-
clude intermediate layers of the software stack silently disabling
certiﬁcate validation and developers turning off certiﬁcate valida-
tion accidentally (e.g., for testing) or intentionally.

2. OVERVIEW OF OUR RESULTS

Our study uncovered a wide variety of SSL certiﬁcate valida-
tion bugs. Affected programs include those responsible for manag-
ing cloud-based storage and computation, such as Amazon’s EC2
Java client library and Elastic Load Balancing API Tools, Apache
Libcloud, Rackspace iOS client, and Windows-based cloud storage
clients such as ElephantDrive and FilesAnywhere.

Java-based Web-services middleware, such as Apache Axis, Axis
2, and Codehaus XFire, is broken, too. So is the Android library
for Pusher notiﬁcation API and Apache ActiveMQ implementation
of Java Message Service. All programs employing this middleware
are generically insecure.

Certiﬁcate validation bugs are pervasive in “merchant SDKs,”
which typically run on e-commerce servers (e.g., online stores) and
are responsible for transmitting customers’ ﬁnancial details to pay-
ment processing gateways. Broken libraries include Amazon Flex-
ible Payments Service (both Java and PHP), as well as PayPal Pay-
ments Standard and PayPal Invoicing (both in PHP), PayPal Pay-
ments Pro, Mass Pay, and Transactional Information SOAP (all in
Java). Most payment modules for integrated shopping carts, such
as ZenCart, Ubercart, PrestaShop, and osCommerce, do not val-
idate certiﬁcates, either. A man-in-the-middle attack enables the
attacker to harvest credit card numbers, names, addresses, etc. of
the customers of any merchant who uses one of these programs for
payment processing. Mobile app providers who use AdMob’s sam-
ple code to link app instances to their AdMob accounts are vulner-
able, too, enabling the attacker to capture the developer’s account
credentials and gain access to all of her Google services.

Instant messenger clients such as Trillian and AIM do not val-
idate certiﬁcates correctly, either. A man-in-the-middle attack on
Trillian yields login credentials for all Google (including Gmail),
Yahoo!, and Windows Live services (including SkyDrive).

Not the most interesting technically, but perhaps the most devas-
tating (because of the ease of exploitation) bug is the broken certiﬁ-
cate validation in the Chase mobile banking app on Android. Even
a primitive network attacker—for example, someone in control of
a malicious Wi-Fi access point—can exploit this vulnerability to
harvest the login credentials of Chase mobile banking customers.
Other insecure Android software includes Breezy, a “secure” print-
ing app, and the ACRA library for application crash reporting.

In summary, SSL connections established by any of the above
programs are insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack. All
vulnerabilities have been empirically conﬁrmed.

Causes. For the most part, the actual SSL libraries used in these
programs are correct. Yet, regardless of which well-known library
the software relies on—whether JSSE, OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or Cryp-
toAPI, used directly or wrapped into a data-transport library such
as Apache HttpClient or cURL—it often ﬁnds a way to end up with
broken or disabled SSL certiﬁcate validation.

The primary cause of these vulnerabilities is the developers’ mis-
understanding of the numerous options, parameters, and return val-
ues of SSL libraries. For example, Amazon’s Flexible Payments
Service PHP library attempts to enable hostname veriﬁcation by
setting cURL’s CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST parameter to true. Un-
fortunately, the correct, default value of this parameter is 2; setting
it to true silently changes it to 1 and disables certiﬁcate validation.
PayPal Payments Standard PHP library introduced the same bug
when updating a previous, broken implementation. Another ex-
ample is Lynx, a text-based browser which is often used program-
matically and thus included in our study. It checks for self-signed
certiﬁcates—but only if GnuTLS’s certiﬁcate validation function
returns a negative value. Unfortunately, this function returns 0 for
certain errors, including certiﬁcates signed by an untrusted author-
ity. Chain-of-trust veriﬁcation in Lynx is thus broken.

Developers often misunderstand security guarantees provided by
SSL libraries. For example, JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension)
has multiple interfaces for managing SSL connections. The “ad-
vanced” SSLSocketFactory API silently skips hostname veriﬁca-
tion if the algorithm ﬁeld in the SSL client is NULL or an empty
string rather than HTTPS. This is mentioned in passing in the JSSE
reference guide, yet many Java implementations of SSL-based pro-
tocols use SSLSocketFactory without performing their own host-
name veriﬁcation. Vulnerable libraries include Apache HttpClient
version 3.* and the Weberknecht implementation of WebSockets.
Any Java program based on these libraries is generically insecure
against a man-in-the-middle attack. Vulnerable programs include
SOAP Web-services middleware such as Apache Axis and Code-
haus XFire, as well as any software built on top of it (for ex-
ample, Amazon’s EC2 client library), any Android app that uses
Pusher API to manage real-time messaging (for example, GitHub’s
Gaug.es), clients of Apache ActiveMQ servers, etc.

Other bugs include using incorrect regular expressions for host-
name matching, not checking the results of certiﬁcate validation
correctly, accidentally or deliberately disabling validation, etc.

Lessons. First, the state of adversarial testing appears to be excep-
tionally poor even for critical software such as mobile banking apps
and merchant SDKs responsible for managing secure connections
to payment processors. Most of the vulnerabilities we found should
have been discovered during development with proper unit testing.
Second, many SSL libraries are unsafe by default, requiring high-
er-level software to correctly set their options, provide hostname
veriﬁcation functions, and interpret return values. As we show,
software that relies on these libraries is often not up to the task.

Third, even safe-by-default libraries, such as cURL’s wrapper
around OpenSSL, are misused by developers that misinterpret the
meaning of various options. This calls for better documentation and
more rigorous formalization of API semantics. In particular, APIs
should present high-level abstractions to developers, such as “con-
ﬁdential and authenticated tunnel,” as opposed to requiring them to
explicitly deal with low-level details such as hostname veriﬁcation.
Fourth, SSL bugs are often hidden deep inside layers of middle-
ware, above the actual SSL implementation but below the applica-

tion, making the problem hard to locate and repair, and effectively
taking it out of application developers’ hands.

Fifth, least interesting technically but still critically important,
we observed many cases of developers deliberately disabling cer-
tiﬁcate validation, while assuring both users and higher-level pro-
grams that SSL is being supported but not informing them that pro-
tection against active attacks has been turned off.

3. OVERVIEW OF SSL

3.1 Threat model

We assume an active, man-in-the-middle network attacker who
may control network routers or switches, Wi-Fi access points, and/or
DNS. She may also control one or more servers and possess valid
SSL certiﬁcates for these servers. When an SSL client attempts to
connect to a legitimate server, the attacker can mislead it about the
server’s network address (e.g., through DNS poisoning) and trick it
into connecting to an attacker-controlled server instead.

Our attacker (1) does not have access to the private keys of le-
gitimate servers, (2) does not control any certiﬁcate authorities, (3)
cannot forge certiﬁcates. Even if she succeeds in spooﬁng the ad-
dress of a legitimate server, a correctly implemented SSL client
should refuse to accept the malicious server’s certiﬁcate because of
a mismatch between the name(s) on the certiﬁcate and the domain
to which the client is connecting.

3.2 SSL certiﬁcate validation

An SSL connection starts with a handshake between the client
and the server. The handshake protocol is summarized in Figure 1;
see RFC 6101 [16] for a complete description.

We focus on the client’s validation of the server certiﬁcate. All
SSL implementations we tested use X.509 certiﬁcates. The com-
plete algorithm for validating X.509 certiﬁcates can be found in
RFC 5280 [15] and RFC 2818 [14]. In this paper, we consider two
of the checks; both are critical for security against active attacks.

Chain-of-trust veriﬁcation. Each X.509 certiﬁcate has an “issuer”
ﬁeld that contains the name of the certiﬁcate authority (CA) that
issued the certiﬁcate. Every SSL client is conﬁgured with a list of
certiﬁcates for trusted root CAs.

In addition to its own certiﬁcate, the server sends the certiﬁcate
of the issuing CA. If the issuing CA is not a root CA, the server
also sends a list of certiﬁcates of higher-level CAs all the way to
a root CA. The client attempts to build a chain starting from the
server’s certiﬁcate at the bottom. Each certiﬁcate in the chain must
be signed by the CA immediately above it; the root CA must be one
of the client’s trusted CAs. The client also veriﬁes that the certiﬁ-

cates have not expired and that the certiﬁcates of the intermediate
CAs have the CA bit set in the “Basic Constraints” ﬁeld.

Hostname veriﬁcation. After the chain of trust is established, the
client must verify the server’s identity. RFC 2818 advises the im-
plementors to use “SubjectAltNames” as the main source of server
identiﬁers and support “Common Name” for backward compatibil-
ity only, but most of the software we tested does it the other way
around and checks “Common Name” ﬁrst. After building the list
of server identiﬁers, the client attempts to match the fully qualiﬁed
DNS name of the requested server to one of the identiﬁers.

If the client ﬁnds an exact match in the list of server identi-
ﬁers, veriﬁcation is done by straightforward string comparison. The
client may also ﬁnd a wildcard name in the list of identiﬁers. The
rules for wildcard matching are fairly complex [14, 17], especially
concerning international character sets.

Certiﬁcate revocation and X.509 extensions. This paper focuses
on verifying the server’s identity, but full certiﬁcate validation in-
volves many more checks. These checks are essential for security,
yet are handled poorly or not at all by non-browser software.

For example, some SSL libraries such as OpenSSL implement
certiﬁcate revocation, but require the application to provide the
certiﬁcate revocation list (CRL). The applications we analyzed do
not avail themselves of this facility. Furthermore, libraries such as
JSSE require the application to check validity of the CRL on its
own. Most applications don’t bother. Other SSL libraries, such as
Python’s ssl, do not expose a method for CRL checking.

Some X.509 certiﬁcate extensions contain security-critical infor-
mation such as key usage (e.g., is the CA allowed to use this key for
signing certiﬁcates?), name constraints (restricting the names that
a sub-CA can certify), and certiﬁcate policies, described in RFC
2527 [13]. For instance, a CA may assign different levels of trust
to different sub-CAs, but the application must provide a policy that
takes advantage of this information. In practice, these extensions
are largely neglected. For example, until recently OpenSSL did not
validate name constraints correctly, while cURL does not even have
an interface for specifying the application’s certiﬁcate policy.

Attacks exploiting improper treatment of certiﬁcate revocation
and X.509 extensions are somewhat different from the “pure” man-
in-the-middle model considered in this paper. We leave their de-
tailed analysis to future work.

4. SSL ABSTRACTIONS

Depending on its needs, an application can “plug” into SSL at
different levels of abstraction. At the lowest level, there are many
popular SSL implementations with different features, licenses, and
hardware requirements: OpenSSL, JSSE, CryptoAPI, NSS, yaSSL,
GnuTLS, BouncyCastle, and others. These libraries are mostly
oblivious to protocols transported over SSL. Therefore, to avoid
having to parse HTTP messages on their own, applications that in-
volve HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) typically do not use them directly.
Instead, they employ one of the many HTTPS libraries (see Sec-
tion 4.2), which in turn use SSL libraries internally. Applications
that use SOAP- or REST-based Web services require additional
middleware on top of HTTPS or WebSockets (see Figure 2).

4.1 SSL libraries

OpenSSL. OpenSSL only provides chain-of-trust veriﬁcation; ap-
plications must supply their own hostname veriﬁcation code. This
is typical for low-level SSL libraries. Different application-layer
protocols such as HTTPS, LDAP, etc. have different notions of
what constitutes a valid hostname and what it means for a hostname
to match the name(s) listed in the certiﬁcate. Therefore, hostname

veriﬁcation must be managed either by the application itself, or by
a data-transport wrapper such as cURL.

Proper hostname veriﬁcation for OpenSSL and CryptoAPI is dis-
cussed in [21, Chap. 10.8], assuming the chain of trust has been
veriﬁed correctly. As discussed in [21, Chap. 10.5], the latter is
error-prone due to the complexity of the underlying API. OpenSSL
allows applications to customize chain-of-trust veriﬁcation by pro-
viding a callback function or modifying conﬁguration variables such
as “verify depth” and “verify mode” as shown in Figure 3.

A program using OpenSSL can perform the SSL handshake by
invoking the SSL_connect function. A high-level overview of the
handling of different conﬁgurations and callbacks is shown in Al-
gorithm 1. They can have complex interactions.

Some certiﬁcate validation errors are signaled through the return
values of SSL_connect, while for other errors SSL_connect returns
OK but sets internal “verify result” ﬂags. Applications must call
SSL_get_ verify_result function to check if any such errors oc-
curred. This approach is error-prone (see Section 7.6).

The certiﬁcate validation function in GnuTLS, gnutls_certif-
icate_verify_peers2, has similarly atrocious error reporting. It
takes a reference to tls_status as an argument and sets it to an
appropriate error code if validation fails. For some errors (e.g.,
insufﬁcient credentials or no certiﬁcate found), it returns a negative
value; for others (e.g., self-signed certiﬁcate), it sets the error code
but returns zero. In Section 7.4 we show that application developers
misunderstand this complex relationship between the error status
and the return value, resulting in broken certiﬁcate validation.

JSSE. Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) provides numerous in-
terfaces through which Java applications—including Android mo-
bile apps—can establish SSL connections.

The low-level API is SSLSocketFactory. Depending on how the
SSL client is created, this API may or may not perform hostname
veriﬁcation. The following code sample is taken from X509Trust
ManagerImpl.checkIdentity in Java 6 update 31:

private void checkIdentity(String hostname,
X509Certificate cert, String algorithm)

throws CertificateException {
if (algorithm != null && algorithm.length() != 0) {

....

if (algorithm.equalsIgnoreCase("HTTPS")) {

HostnameChecker.getInstance(HostnameChecker.TYPE

_TLS).match(hostname, cert);

} else if (algorithm.equalsIgnoreCase("LDAP")) {

HostnameChecker.getInstance(HostnameChecker.TYPE

_LDAP).match(hostname, cert);

} else {

throw new CertificateException(

"Unknown identification algorithm: " + algorithm);

}

}

}

The checkIdentity method throws an exception if the algorithm
ﬁeld is set to anything other than HTTPS or LDAP. This is different
from, for example, OpenSSL, which returns a value even if veriﬁ-
cation fails and expects the application to check this value.

JSSE APIs such as HttpsClient and HttpsURLConnection call
try SetHostnameVerification when creating SSL clients. This
method sets the algorithm ﬁeld to HTTPS. The above code thus
invokes HostnameChecker and veriﬁes the name in the certiﬁcate.

If the algorithm ﬁeld in the client data structure is NULL or an
empty string, checkIdentity silently skips hostname veriﬁcation
without throwing an exception. We conjecture that this behav-
ior is designed to accommodate implementors of certiﬁcate-based
protocols other than HTTPS or LDAP who may want to re-use

JSSE’s default trust manager for chain-of-trust veriﬁcation but pro-
vide their own, protocol-speciﬁc hostname veriﬁcation.

On February 14, 2012, Java 7 update 3 was released. The code
for certiﬁcate validation is different from Java 6, but its behav-
ior is similar: if the algorithm ﬁeld is NULL or an empty string,
checkIdentity is never invoked.

private void checkTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain,

String authType, Socket socket, boolean isClient)
throws CertificateException {
...
/ /
String identityAlg = sslSocket.getSSLParameters().

c h e c k e n d p o i n t

i d e n t i t y

getEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm();

if (identityAlg != null && identityAlg.length != 0)

{

String hostname = session.getPeerHost();
checkIdentity(hostname, chain[0], identityAlg);

}

}

In SSL clients created using “raw” SSLSocketFactory (as op-
posed to HttpsClient or HttpsURLConnection wrappers), the algo-
rithm ﬁeld is NULL, thus JSSE does not perform hostname veriﬁ-
cation. The responsibility for hostname veriﬁcation is delegated to
the software running on top of JSSE. This feature is not explained
in the API documentation. Instead, the following warning can be
found deep inside the JSSE reference guide:2

When using raw SSLSockets/SSLEngines you should
always check the peer’s credentials before sending any
data. The SSLSocket and SSLEngine classes do not
automatically verify that the hostname in a URL matches
the hostname in the peer’s credentials. An application
could be exploited with URL spooﬁng if the hostname
is not veriﬁed.

The prevalence of Java software that uses SSLSocketFactory to
create SSL clients yet does not perform hostname veriﬁcation (see
Section 4.2) suggests that developers are not aware of this feature.
The existence of alternative JSSE interfaces that do perform host-
name veriﬁcation only increases the confusion.

4.2 Data-transport libraries

In practice, most applications rely on data-transport frameworks
to establish HTTPS connections. These frameworks use SSL li-
braries internally in a way that is usually opaque to applications.
Apache HttpClient. Apache HttpClient3 is a client-side HTTP(S)
Java library based on JDK. The latest version is 4.2.1, published
on June 29, 2012, but most existing software employs older, 3.*
versions. Apache HttpClient is used extensively in Web-services
middleware such as Apache Axis 2 (see Section 8) because native
JDK does not support SOAP Web services. Furthermore, Apache
HttpClient provides better performance than JDK for functionali-
ties such as sending HTTP POST requests.

Apache HttpClient uses JSSE’s SSLSocketFactory to establish
SSL connections. As explained in Section 4.1, this means that
Apache HttpClient must perform its own hostname veriﬁcation.
This leads to numerous vulnerabilities in software based on older
versions on HttpClient that do not verify hostnames (Section 7.5).
Furthermore, Apache HttpClient uses HttpHost data structure to
describe HTTP(S) connections. HttpHost does not have any inter-

2http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/
technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.
html

ga/

nal consistency checks: for example, it allows connections to port
443 to have HTTP as the scheme. In Section 7.8, we show how this
leads to errors even in code implemented by SSL experts.
Weberknecht. Weberknecht4 is a Java implementation of the Web-
Sockets protocol. It uses SSLSocketFactory but does not perform
its own hostname veriﬁcation. Any Java program that employs We-
berknecht is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.
cURL. cURL5 is a popular tool and library (libcurl) for fetching
data from remote servers. Since version 7.10, cURL validates SSL
certiﬁcates by default.
Internally, it uses OpenSSL to verify the
chain of trust and veriﬁes the hostname itself. This functionality is
controlled by parameters CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER (default value:
true) and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST (default value: 2).

This interface is almost perversely bad. The VERIFYPEER param-
eter is a boolean, while a similar-looking VERIFYHOST parameter is
an integer. The following quote from the cURL manual explains
the meaning of CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST:

1 to check the existence of a common name in the SSL
peer certiﬁcate. 2 to check the existence of a common
name and also verify that it matches the hostname pro-
vided.
In production environments the value of this
option should be kept at 2 (default value).

Well-intentioned developers not only routinely misunderstand
these parameters, but often set CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFY HOST to TRUE,
thereby changing it to 1 and thus accidentally disabling hostname
veriﬁcation with disastrous consequences (see Section 7.1).

PHP. PHP provides several methods for establishing SSL connec-
tions. For example, fsockopen, which opens a raw socket to the
remote server, can be used to connect to SSL servers by putting
“ssl://” in the URL. Even though fsockopen does not perform any
certiﬁcate checks whatsoever, PHP application developers routinely
use it for SSL connection establishment (see Section 9).

PHP also provides a cURL binding, which uses cURL’s default
settings to establish SSL connections with proper certiﬁcate valida-
tion. As we show in Sections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, application develop-
ers often set cURL options incorrectly, overriding the defaults and
breaking certiﬁcate validation.

Python. Several Python modules can be used for SSL connection
establishment. urllib, urllib2, and httplib connect to SSL servers
but do not check certiﬁcates. This is clearly documented in a bright
pink box on the urllib front page:6

Warning: When opening HTTPS URLs, it does not
attempt to validate the server certiﬁcate. Use at your
own risk!

Nevertheless, even high-security applications routinely use these

modules for SSL connection establishment (see Section 9).

Python also has an ssl module. This module veriﬁes the certiﬁ-
cate’s chain of trust, but not the hostname. The application must do
its own hostname veriﬁcation. In Python version 3, the ssl module
introduced the match_hostname method for hostname veriﬁcation,
but it must be explicitly called by the application.

5. SSL IN NON-BROWSER SOFTWARE

We analyze a representative sample of non-browser software ap-
plications and libraries that use SSL for secure Internet connec-
tions. Some programs, such as instant messenger clients and sim-
ple mobile banking apps, are fairly straightforward in their use of
SSL. Others, especially middleware libraries, use SSL as part of a
multi-layer software stack. Many of the programs we analyze trans-
mit extremely sensitive data—private ﬁles of individual users in the
case of cloud clients, ﬁnancial information of customers in the case
of merchant SDKs, developer account credentials in the case of
mobile advertising software—over potentially insecure public net-
works, thus it is absolutely critical that they use SSL correctly.

Cloud client APIs. As cloud-computing platforms such as Ama-
zon EC2 grow in popularity, their operators supply client SDKs
through which third-party software can transmit user data to cloud-
based storage, manage cloud-based computation (e.g., start and ter-
minate virtual instances), and access other cloud services. For ex-
ample, Amazon provides EC2 API tools in Java, PHP, Python, and
Perl. Apache Libcloud is an example of an independent library for
accessing multiple cloud providers.

Merchant payment SDKs. Operators of e-commerce websites of-
ten rely on third parties such as PayPal and Amazon Flexible Pay-
ments Service (FPS) to process their customers’ payments. Pay-
ment processors provide merchant SDKs (software development
kits) in a variety of languages. These libraries are designed to be
integrated into the back end of e-commerce websites. Merchant
software uses them to transmit customers’ payment details and/or
receive notiﬁcations when payments are made by customers.

An online store typically has two options for payment process-
ing. The ﬁrst option is to have the customer enter payment details
directly into the payment processor’s website. When the customer
checks out, the merchant’s website redirects her browser to PayPal
or Amazon, where the customer enters her name, credit or debit
card number, etc. The merchant never sees these details. Once the
payment is complete, the payment processor redirects the customer
back to the merchant’s website and notiﬁes the merchant.

The merchant’s site runs a daemon listening for IPN (Instant Pay-
ment Notiﬁcation) calls from the payment processor. Upon receiv-
ing a notiﬁcation, the merchant is advised to verify that the call in-
deed originated from the processor (some merchants skip this step,
opening the door to “shop-for-free” attacks [23]). The merchant
then completes the transaction with the customer.

The second option is preferred by larger, more established stores.
It does not require the customer to leave the merchant’s website and
allows the merchant to collect payment details directly from the
customer. The back-end software on the merchant’s website then
transmits these details to the payment processor’s gateway over an
SSL connection and receives the conﬁrmation that the payment suc-
ceeded (often over the same SSL connection).

Fig. 4 shows schematically the interaction between the merchant’s
server and the payment gateway. The SSL client is the merchant’s
back-end software (running on the merchant’s server), while the
payment gateway acts as the SSL server.

We analyzed SSL connection establishment in popular merchant
SDKs, including Java and PHP SDKs for Amazon Flexible Pay-
ments Service and multiple interfaces to PayPal: Payments Pro,
Transactional Information, and Mass Pay (all in Java), as well as
Payments Standard and Invoicing (PHP). We also analyzed both
Amazon’s and PayPal’s utilities that merchants can use to verify
the origin of IPN (Instant Payment Notiﬁcation) calls.

We also analyzed several open-source shopping carts written in
PHP: osCommerce, ZenCart, Ubercart, and PrestaShop. Shopping

carts are an important component of e-commerce websites. They
keep track of customers’ shipping and billing information and al-
low them to purchase multiple items in one transaction. When the
customer checks out, the shopping cart generates a summary of the
purchases and the total price and sends it to the payment gateway.
Shopping carts include modules for many payment processors.

Web-services middleware. Many modern programs rely on Web
services. A Web service is “a software system designed to support
interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network.”7 A
service has an interface described in a machine-readable XML for-
mat. Different providers may provide different concrete implemen-
tations of this interface. Other systems interact with the service by
sending and receiving messages.

Messages to and from Web services are sent using XML-based
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) or REpresentational State
Transfer (REST). From the viewpoint of the client software, a Web
service can be thought of as providing a remote procedure call
(RPC) interface, while SOAP or REST middleware marshals and
unmarshals arguments of RPC calls.

To interact with such a Web service—for example, if a cloud
client implemented in Java wants to interact with Amazon EC2 —
existing Java software often uses SOAP middleware such as Apache
Axis, Axis 2, or Codehaus XFire (see Section 8). Similarly, if
an Android app needs real-time “push” notiﬁcations, it may use
a client-side library to connect to the REST-based Pusher service.8
These middleware frameworks are responsible for transmitting
Web-service messages over the network. If the connection must be
secure, the middleware typically uses SSL but delegates actual SSL
connection management to a data-transport library such as Apache
HttpClient or Weberknecht (see Section 4.2).

Mobile advertising. Mobile advertising services such as AdMob
supply software that providers of mobile apps install on their sites.
When a new app instance is initialized on a customer’s phone, it
connects to the provider’s site, which in turn notiﬁes the AdMob
server so that all ads shown to this app instance will be associated
with the provider’s account (to enable ad revenue sharing, etc.).
The connection from the app provider’s site to the AdMob server
contains the provider’s credentials and must be protected by SSL.

6. EXPERIMENTAL TESTBED

Our primary methodology for the initial discovery of SSL cer-
tiﬁcate validation bugs is black-box fuzzing. We test applications
and libraries implementing SSL client functionality on two Dell
laptops running Microsoft Windows 7 Professional Service Pack

7http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-arch/
8http://pusher.com

1 and Ubuntu Linux 10.04, respectively. Mobile applications are
tested on a Nexus One smartphone running Android 2.3.6 and an
iPad 2 running iOS 4.2.1.

We use local DNS cache poisoning to divert clients’ connections
to a simulated attack server executing on an old Dell laptop with
Ubuntu Linux 10.04. To simulate a man-in-the-middle attacker, we
built two prototypes: one in Java, using JKS keystore to manage
the attacker’s certiﬁcates and keys, the other in C, using OpenSSL
for certiﬁcate and key management. We also used Fiddler, a Web
debugging proxy [9]. If Fiddler encounters a connection request
to a server it has not seen before, it creates a new certiﬁcate with
the common name matching the requested name and stores it in
its repository; otherwise, it retrieves an existing certiﬁcate from
its repository. Fiddler then presents the certiﬁcate to the client,
allowing us to simulate a man-in-the-middle attacker who presents
self-signed certiﬁcates with correct common names. In addition,
we enabled Fiddler to capture and decrypt HTTPS connections.

Our simulated “man-in-the-middle” server presents the client with
several certiﬁcates: (1) a self-signed certiﬁcate with the same com-
mon name as the host the client is attempting to connect to, (2) a
self-signed certiﬁcate with an incorrect common name, and (3) a
valid certiﬁcate issued by a trusted certiﬁcate authority to a domain
called AllYourSSLAreBelongTo.us. If the client establishes
an SSL connection, the attack server decrypts trafﬁc sent by the
client. It can then establish its own SSL connection to any legiti-
mate server speciﬁed by the attacker and forward the client’s trafﬁc.
The attack server also listens for the legitimate server’s response,
decrypts and logs it, re-encrypts it with the symmetric key the at-
tacker shares with the client and forwards it to the client.

If we observed a particular client successfully establishing an
SSL connection when presented with any of the attack certiﬁcates,
we analyzed the source code of the client or, in the case of closed-
source applications, the results of reverse-engineering, decompi-
lation, and runtime traces (focusing in particular on calls to SSL
libraries) in order to ﬁnd the root cause of the vulnerability.

The URL veriﬁcation utility—found in src\Amazon\IpnRe-
turnUrlValidation\SignatureUtilsForOutbound.
php—is broken in a very similar way. This utility is critically im-
portant because it is used by merchants to verify the origin of the
calls informing them that a customer’s payment has been success-
fully processed (see Section 5). Because Amazon’s PHP SDK does
not correctly verify the origin of the IPN call, e-commerce sites
using it may be vulnerable to “shop-for-free” attacks [23].

7.2 PayPal Payments Standard and

PayPal Invoicing (PHP)

PayPal Payments Standard SDK implemented in PHP uses cURL.

The previous version disabled all certiﬁcate validation checks:

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, FALSE);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, FALSE);

The version released on April 27, 2012, “ﬁxes” the problem:

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, TRUE);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, TRUE);

As in Section 7.1, this code overrides the correct default value of

CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST and breaks hostname veriﬁcation.

PayPal Invoicing contains similarly broken code:

public function setHttpTrustAllConnection(

$trustAllConnection)

{

}

$this->curlOpt[CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER] =

!$trustAllConnection;

$this->curlOpt[CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST] =

!$trustAllConnection;

Any PHP code using these PayPal-provided SDKs to establish
an SSL connection to PayPal’s payment processing gateway is in-
secure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

In Sections 7 through 10, we describe the vulnerabilities in spe-

7.3 PayPal IPN in ZenCart

ciﬁc programs, arranged by error type.

7. MISUNDERSTANDING THE SSL API

7.1 Amazon Flexible Payments Service (PHP)
Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) provides SDKs that
merchants use to transmit customers’ payment details to the FPS
gateway. The PHP version of the FPS SDK uses a wrapper around
the libcurl library (see Section 4.2) to establish an SSL connection
to the gateway. cURL’s options for certiﬁcate validation are set in
src\Amazon\FOPS\Client.php as follows:

curl_setopt($curlHandle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);
curl_setopt($curlHandle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, true);
...
/ / E x e c u t e t h e
$response = curl_exec($curlHandle);

r e q u e s t

This well-intentioned code contains a fatal mistake. cURL’s de-
fault value of CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST is correctly set to 2. In the
curl_setopt($curlHandle,CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, true) call,
true silently turns into 1, overriding the default and instructing
cURL to check the existence of any common name in the certiﬁcate
(Section 4.2), which may or may not match the name requested.

Any PHP code using this Amazon-provided SDK to establish an
SSL connection to the Amazon Flexible Payments Service gateway
is insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

ZenCart’s functionality for PayPal IPN shows a profound misun-
derstanding of cURL’s parameters. It disables certiﬁcate validation
entirely, yet attempts to enable hostname veriﬁcation—even though
the latter has no effect if certiﬁcate validation is disabled.

$curlOpts=array( ...

CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => FALSE,
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => 2
... );

7.4 Lynx

Lynx is a text-based browser, included in our study because it is
often used programmatically by other software. It relies on GnuTLS
to validate SSL certiﬁcates:

ret = gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2(handle->gnutls_

state, &tls_status);

if (ret < 0) {

int flag_continue = 1;
char *msg2;

if (tls_status & GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND) {

msg2 = gettext("no issuer was found");

} else if (tls_status & GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_CA) {

msg2 = gettext("issuer is not a CA");

} else if (tls_status & GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND)

{

msg2 = gettext("the certificate has no known issuer"

);

} else if (tls_status & GNUTLS_CERT_REVOKED) {

msg2 = gettext("the certificate has been revoked");

} else {

msg2 = gettext("the certificate is not trusted"); }

... }

This code misinterprets the semantics of gnutls_certificate_
verify_peers2. As explained in Section 4.1, this function indeed
sets the tls_status code if certiﬁcate validation fails, but for cer-
tain errors—including self-signed certiﬁcates!—it returns 0. Even
though the above code includes two identical checks for GNUTLS_
CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND, neither check is ever executed when GNU-
TLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND is actually true! In this case hostname
veriﬁcation is correct, but chain-of-trust veriﬁcation is broken.

7.5 Apache HttpClient

The most widely used version of Apache HttpClient is 3.1, re-
leased in 2007. This library, as well as its earlier versions, sets
up SSL connections using JSSE’s SSLSocketFactory without per-
forming its own hostname veriﬁcation (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2).
As a consequence, Apache HttpClient 3.* accepts any certiﬁcate
with a valid chain of trust, regardless of the name. As mentioned in
Section 4.2, the same bug occurs in Weberknecht.

The hostname veriﬁcation bug in HttpClient was ﬁxed in version
4.0-alpha1 [1]. The current version, 4.2.1, has its own hostname
veriﬁer and delegates chain-of-trust veriﬁcation to JSSE. Unfortu-
nately, as we show in Section 8, the existence of a correct imple-
mentation of HttpClient has had little effect on the security of appli-
cations that rely on HttpClient for SSL connection establishment.
Apache HttpClient 4.* involved a major architectural re-design,
thus much of legacy and even new software still relies on version
3.*. The use of HttpClient is often hidden inside Web-services mid-
dleware such as Axis 2 and XFire, which—several years after ver-
sion 4.* became available—still ship with HttpClient 3.* and thus
skip hostname veriﬁcation for SSL certiﬁcates.

It is worth noting that the custom hostname veriﬁcation code
added to HttpClient 4.* is incorrect and will reject valid certiﬁcates.
The following code is from HttpClient 4.2.1:

/ / The CN b e t t e r h a v e a t

} else {

i s n o t

example, it will reject mail.<a>.<b>.com if the name in the
certiﬁcate is m*.<a>.<b>.com.

Furthermore, the original patch, as well as its derivatives, has
a minor bug in the regular expression for parsing IPv4 addresses,
causing it to accept IP addresses starting with zero (this does not
immediately result in a security vulnerability):

private static final Pattern IPV4_PATTERN =

Pattern.compile("^(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d

?\\d)(\\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d))
{3}\$");

7.6 Trillian

Trillian, a popular instant messenger client, relies on OpenSSL
for SSL connection establishment. By default, OpenSSL does not
throw a run-time exception if the certiﬁcate is self-signed or has an
invalid chain of trust. Instead, it sets ﬂags. Furthermore, OpenSSL
does not provide any hostname veriﬁcation.

If the application has called SSL_CTX_set to set the SSL_VERIFY
_PEER ﬂag (see Section 4.1), then SSL_connect exits and prints an
error message when certiﬁcate validation fails. Trillian does not set
the SSL_VERIFY_PEER ﬂag. When this ﬂag is not set, SSL_connect
returns 1. The application is then expected to check the status of
certiﬁcate validation by calling SSL_get_verify_result. Trillian
does not call this function.

Trillian thus accepts any SSL certiﬁcate and is insecure against a
man-in-the-middle attack. Depending on the speciﬁc module cho-
sen by the Trillian user, this reveals usernames, passwords, secu-
rity tokens, etc. for Google Talk (typically compromising all of the
user’s Google services), AIM, ICQ, Windows Live (including Sky-
Drive), and Yahoo! Messenger (and thus all Yahoo! services).

Interestingly, it was reported back in 2009 that older versions of
Trillian do not correctly validate MSN certiﬁcates [20]. This bug
was ostensibly ﬁxed in Trillian 4.2. Our analysis shows, however,
that SSL certiﬁcate validation is still completely broken for all ser-
vices, not just for MSN (Windows Live), in Trillian 5.1.0.19.

7.7 Rackspace

The Rackspace app for iOS (version 2.1.5) is an open-source
application for administering Rackspace cloud services. It uses the
OpenStack iOS cloud client framework, which in turn relies on the
ASIHTTPRequest library to set up HTTPS connections.

ASIHTTPRequest provides a conﬁguration variable Validates
SecureCertificate, set to 1 by default.
If reset to 0, it turns
off both chain-of-trust and hostname veriﬁcation. OpenStack sup-
ports multiple accounts on remote servers and lets users customize
SSL certiﬁcate validation on per-account basis using the ignoreSSL
Validation variable. The value of this variable depends on the GUI
switch validateSSLSwitch, which should be shown to the user.

The Rackspace app (version 2.1.5) does not present the user with
this option.9 The GUI switch validateSSLSwitch is thus never dis-
played or explicitly assigned. Instead, it is simply initialized to 0 by
the Objective-C allocator. This turns on ignoreSSLValidation in
ASIHTTPRequest, which in turn sets ValidatesSecureCertificate
to 0 and disables certiﬁcate validation.

As a consequence, SSL connections established by the Rackspace

app on iOS are insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

match = hostName.equals(cn);

}

7.8 TextSecure

This code computes the length of the preﬁx by subtracting 2
from the number of parts (determined by the number of dots in the
name). This logic is incorrect: validity of the ﬁrst part of a domain
name should have nothing to do with the total number of parts. For

TextSecure is an Android application for encrypting SMS and
It was written by Moxie Marlinspike who had

MMS messages.

9We are informed by Mike Mayo that this was an accidental over-
sight and will be ﬁxed in subsequent releases of the app.

previously discovered several SSL certiﬁcate validation vulnerabil-
ities [11, 12]. This following code can be found in the application
(however, it does not appear to be reachable from the user interface
and may not currently lead to an exploitable vulnerability):

schemeRegistry.register(new Scheme("http",

PlainSocketFactory.getSocketFactory(), 80));

schemeRegistry.register(new Scheme("https",

SSLSocketFactory.getSocketFactory(), 443));

...
HttpHost target = new HttpHost(hostUrl.getHost(),

hostUrl.getPort(), HttpHost.DEFAULT_SCHEME_NAME);

...
HttpResponse response = client.execute(target, request);

Even if the port number is 443, DEFAULT_SCHEME_NAME is “http”

and the connection is over HTTP, not HTTPS.

8. USING INSECURE MIDDLEWARE

As explained in Section 5, software based on Web services usu-
ally relies on middleware libraries to manage network connections.
SSL functionality inside these libraries is opaque to the applica-
tions. If the middleware employs a broken HTTPS implementation
that does not correctly validate SSL certiﬁcates, all applications
based on it typically “inherit” the vulnerability.

8.1 Apache Axis, Axis 2, Codehaus XFire

Apache Axis is an open-source Java implementation of SOAP.
The latest release is 1.4, discontinued in 2007 in favor of Axis 2,
but the library is still used, for example, in PayPal’s Java SDKs.
Apache Axis 2 is a complete redesign of Apache Axis. The lat-
est release is 1.6.2. Codehaus XFire is another open-source Java
implementation of SOAP. It was discontinued in 2007 in favor of
Apache CXF, but is still used, for example, in Amazon’s EC2 Java
SDK. The latest release of XFire is 1.2.6.

Apache Axis uses its own version of HttpClient, while Axis 2
and XFire use Apache HttpClient version 3.1. Both versions of
HttpClient rely on SSLSocketFactory for SSL connection estab-
lishment but mistakenly omit hostname veriﬁcation (Section 4.2).
SSL vulnerabilities caused by bugs in Web-services middleware
are pervasive in Amazon libraries. Affected software includes Ama-
zon EC2 API Tools Java library, which uses XFire to set up SSL
connections to EC2 servers, and Amazon Flexible Payments Ser-
vice (Java) merchant SDK, which relies on an old Apache Http-
Client. The latter library is used by merchants to transmit cus-
tomers’ payment details to the FPS gateway. The PHP version of
the library is broken, too, but in a very different way (Section 7.1).
In contrast to the PHP version, however, the Java utility for verify-
ing instant payment notiﬁcations uses JSSE’s HttpsClient instead
of Apache HttpClient and thus checks SSL certiﬁcates correctly.

Other software that relies on Axis includes Java SOAP SDKs
for PayPal Payments Pro (Direct Payment), PayPal Transac-
tional Information, and PayPal Mass Pay, as well as Apache
ActiveMQ implementation of JMS (Java Message Service).

8.2 Pusher

Pusher is a WebSocket-based API that provides real-time mes-
saging functionality to mobile and Web applications. Pusher’s An-
droid libraries10 are based on Weberknecht (see Section 4.2). Any
application using these libraries (e.g., GitHub’s Gaug.es) is thus
insecure. It is also worth noting that Gaug.es is using an updated
version of Weberknecht, which, in addition to incorrectly using raw
SSLSocketFactory (see Section 4.1), disables the trust manager.

10https://github.com/EmoryM/Android_Pusher

In summary, any software using any of the above Web-services

frameworks is insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

Apache CXF. Apache CXF is a continuation of XFire. It supports
SOAP, along with REST and CORBA; the latest release is 2.6.1.
It does not rely on Apache HttpClient. Instead, SSL connections
are established using OpenJDK’s HttpsClient. Therefore, prop-
erly conﬁgured instances of CXF do verify hostnames.

Apache CXF provides an application-controlled option to turn
off certiﬁcate validation. Certiﬁcate validation is enabled by de-
fault, but was disabled in the sample wsdl_first_https code sup-
plied with CXF until we notiﬁed the developers.

9. USING INSECURE SSL LIBRARIES

As described in Section 4.2, PHP’s fsockopen does not validate
SSL certiﬁcates. Nevertheless, it is often used even by applications
that must be secure against a man-in-the-middle attack. For exam-
ple, PayPal’s IPN utility contains this code:

/ / p o s t b a c k t o PayPal u t i l i t y
...
$fp = fsockopen (’ssl://www.paypal.com’, 443, $errno,

t o v a l i d a t e

$errstr, 30);

This code is replicated in PayPal payment modules for ZenCart
and PrestaShop shopping carts. PrestaShop uses fsockopen in its
CanadaPost payment module, too. Other similarly vulnerable soft-
ware includes Open Source Classiﬁeds,

Python’s URL libraries do not validate certiﬁcates (Section 4.2),
yet developers still use them for SSL connections. Examples in-
clude Tweepy, a library for accessing Twitter API that uses httplib,
and Mozilla’s Zamboni project, which accepts contributions for
extension developers and uses urllib2 to connect to PayPal.

10. BREAKING OR DISABLING
CERTIFICATE VALIDATION

In general, disabling proper certiﬁcate validation appears to be
the developers’ preferred solution to any problem with SSL libraries.
Here are a few typical quotes from developers’ forums:

• “I want my client to accept any certiﬁcate (because I’m only
ever pointing to one server) but I keep getting a javax.net.
ssl.SSLException: Not trusted server certificate ex-
ception”11—[note the fallacious reasoning!]

• “Tutorial: Disabling Certiﬁcate Validation in an HTTPS Con-
nection. . . Reply: Thank you very much. You solved my
biggest problem in the project.” 12

• “I have always turned off CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER

in curl.”13

• “I am using axis on java to consume a webservice. The web
service is in https, and I want to avoid the the check for cer-
tiﬁcate.”14

• “However, by default, SSL support in NSStream is a little
paranoid.
It won’t, for example, use a self-signed certiﬁ-
cate or an expired certiﬁcate to establish a secure connec-
tion. NSStream does a number of validity checks when es-
tablishing the secure connection, and if they don’t all pass,
the streams appear to be valid, but no data gets sent or re-
ceived. This is somewhat frustrating, and it could be there’s
a way to ﬁnd out when the secure connection failed, but I
haven’t been able to ﬁnd it in the documentation, or using
Google. There is an error domain declared for these errors
(NSStreamSocketSSLErrorDomain), but in my experimenta-
tion, no errors gets generated, the streams even accept bytes
for transfer, but nothing happens.” 15

Unfortunately, these bad development practices ﬁnd their way
even into critical software responsible for transmitting ﬁnancial in-
formation and sensitive data, where security against man-in-the-
middle attacks is absolutely essential and SSL certiﬁcate valida-
tion should be mandatory. For example, a comment in the Autho-
rize.Net eCheck module of ZenCart says that certiﬁcate validation
is disabled for “compatibility for SSL communications on some
Windows servers (IIS 5.0+)”—note the fallacious reasoning!

10.1 Chase mobile banking

Chase is a major US bank. SSL connections established by its
mobile banking application on Android are insecure against a man-
in-the-middle attack. This allows a network attacker to capture cre-
dentials, such as username and password, of any Chase customer
using this app, along with the rest of their session.

Decompilation and analysis of this app’s code show that it over-
rides the default X509TrustManager. The replacement code simply
returns without checking the server’s certiﬁcate. The code below
is the result of reverse-engineering, thus variable names and other
details may differ from the actual code:

public final void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[]
paramArrayOfX509Certificate, String paramString)

{

if ((paramArrayOfX509Certificate != null) && (
paramArrayOfX509Certificate.length == 1))
paramArrayOfX509Certificate[0].checkValidity();

while (true)
{

return;
this.a.checkServerTrusted(

paramArrayOfX509Certificate, paramString);

}

}

Note the unreachable invocation of checkServerTrusted. We
conjecture that this was a temporary plug during development that
somehow found its way into the production version of the app.

10.2 Apache Libcloud

Apache Libcloud16 is a Python library extension providing sup-
port for 26 different cloud service providers. Libcloud relies on
the underlying Python library to verify the chain of trust in SSL
certiﬁcates; internally, Python uses OpenSSL. Once the chain of
trust is veriﬁed, Libcloud veriﬁes the hostname using the _verify
_hostname method in httplib_ssl.py. This code uses an in-
correct regular expression for hostname veriﬁcation. For example,
it accepts oogle.com as a match for google.com, exposing all
Libcloud clients to a man-in-the-middle attack:

def _verify_hostname(self, hostname, cert):

# V e r i f y h o s t n a m e a g a i n s t p e e r
c e r t
# Check b o t h commonName and e n t r i e s
# u s i n g a r u d i m e n t a r y g l o b t o d n s
# t o f i n d m a t c h e s

i n s u b j e c t A l t N a m e ,

r e g e x c h e c k

common_name = self._get_common_name(cert)
alt_names = self._get_subject_alt_names(cert)

# r e p l a c e ∗ w i t h a l p h a n u m e r i c and d a s h
# r e p l a c e . w i t h l i t e r a l
valid_patterns = [re.compile(pattern.replace(r".", r"

.

\.").replace(r"*", r"[0-9A-Za-z]+"))

for pattern

in (set(common_name) | set(alt_names))

]

return any(

pattern.search(hostname)
for pattern in valid_patterns

)

This bug has been ﬁxed in Libcloud version 0.11.1 after we no-

tiﬁed the developers.

10.3 Amazon Elastic Load Balancing API Tools
This library overrides JDK’s default X509TrustManager to dis-
able hostname veriﬁcation. Even if X509TrustManager had not been
overriden, this library employs Codehaus XFire which does not
perform hostname veriﬁcation (see Section 8.1).

10.4 Shopping carts

osCommerce, ZenCart, Ubercart, and PrestaShop are open-
source shopping carts implemented in PHP. They use cURL for
SSL connections to payment gateways. If cURL is not available,
they typically fall back on (insecure) fsockopen.

All carts are bundled with plugin modules for speciﬁc payment
processors. Almost without exception, these modules turn off cer-
tiﬁcate validation. In ZenCart, vulnerable modules include Link-
Point, Authorize.Net, and PayPal Payments Pro, as well as PayPal
IPN functionality (see Section 7.3). The insecure LinkPoint mod-
ule contains an amusing comment at the beginning of the ﬁle: “###
YOU REALLY DO NOT NEED TO EDIT THIS FILE! ###”

Vulnerable modules include eBay, PayPal, and Canada Post in
PrestaShop, PayPal, Authorize.Net, and CyberSource in Ubercart,
Sage Pay Direct, Authorize.Net, MoneyBookers, and PayPal Ex-
press, Pro, Pro PayFlow, and Pro PayFlow EC in osCommerce.

SSL connections to payment gateways from merchants using any

of these carts are insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

The only exceptions are Google modules for PrestaShop and os-
Commerce. The Google Checkout module for osCommerce comes
from code.google.com and is not bundled with osCommerce.
It sets CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER to true and leaves CURLOPT_SSL_
VERIFYHOST to its correct default value, 2. By contrast, the ofﬁcial,
PayPal-provided PayFlow module disables certiﬁcate validation.

10.5 AdMob

Google’s AdMob provides sample code to mobile site owners
that they can use on their servers to associate instances of their
mobile apps with their developer accounts (see Section 5). This
code uses cURL to establish an SSL connection to AdMob’s server,
but turns off certiﬁcate validation. A man-in-the-middle attacker
can thus gain access to all of the developers’ Google services.

10.6 Android apps

15http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/
05/nsstream-tcp-and-ssl.html
16http://libcloud.apache.org/

Groupon Redemptions, an Android app for merchants, disables
certiﬁcate validation twice: by allowing any hostname via the “al-
low all” hostname veriﬁer and by binding to an empty trust man-

ager. Similarly, Breezy, an app for secure document printing, dis-
ables hostname veriﬁcation and overrides the default trust manager.
ACRA, an Android library for posting application crash reports
to a Google Doc, overrides the default trust manager. Any app
using this library is insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

10.7 AIM

AIM client version 1.0.1.2 on Windows uses Microsoft’s Cryp-
toAPI. Runtime analysis shows that it calls CryptoAPI’s certiﬁ-
cate validation function CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy. To
disable certiﬁcate validation, it passes a CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_PARA
variable with CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_CA_FLAG set, in-
structing CryptoAPI to accept certiﬁcates signed by untrusted au-
thorities. AIM does not perform any hostname veriﬁcation, either.

10.8 FilesAnywhere

FilesAnywhere is an application for managing cloud storage. It
uses CryptoAPI for SSL connections and accepts both self-signed
and third-party certiﬁcates.

FilesAnywhere has an interesting peculiarity. If presented with
a Google certiﬁcate when it attempts to connect to a non-Google
server, it shows a warning message “The WebDav server has a new
address. Please specify http://google.com in the proﬁle.” If pre-
sented with any other third-party certiﬁcate, it silently accepts it
and sends user’s data to a wrong, potentially malicious server.

11. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

Whenever application developers must deal with SSL, the con-
ventional advice is to use standard SSL libraries. This advice is
correct, but insufﬁcient. As this paper shows, even developers of
high-security software often use standard SSL libraries incorrectly.
The following recommendations are informed by our analyses of
broken SSL certiﬁcate validation in diverse applications.

11.1 For application developers

DO use fuzzing (black-box, if necessary) and adversarial test-
ing to see how the application behaves when presented with abnor-
mal SSL certiﬁcates. Even when the vulnerabilities are subtle, the
symptoms usually are not. In many of our case studies, it is obvious
that the software in question has never been tested with any certiﬁ-
cates other than those of the intended server. When presented with
a certiﬁcate issued to AllYourSSLAreBelongTo.us instead
of the expected Amazon or PayPal or Chase certiﬁcate, these pro-
grams eagerly establish SSL connections and spill out their secrets.
These vulnerabilities should have manifested during testing.

DON’T modify application code and disable certiﬁcate valida-
tion for testing with self-signed and/or untrusted certiﬁcates. We
found in our case studies that developers forget to reverse these
modiﬁcations even for the production version of the software. In-
stead, create a temporary keystore with the untrusted CA’s public
key in it. While testing your code with self-signed or untrusted
certiﬁcates, use that keystore as your trusted keystore.

DON’T depend on the library’s defaults to set up the SSL con-
nection securely. Default settings can and do change between dif-
ferent libraries or even different versions of the same library—for
example, cURL prior to version 7.10 did not validate certiﬁcates
by default, but version 7.10 and later do. Always explicitly set the
options necessary for secure connection establishment.

11.2 For SSL library developers

DO make SSL libraries more explicit about the semantics of their
APIs. In many cases, it is obvious that application developers do
not understand the meaning of various options and parameters. For

example, the PHP libraries for Amazon Flexible Payments Services
and PayPal Payments Standard attempt to enable hostname veriﬁ-
cation in cURL, but instead accidentally override the correct default
value and end up disabling it (Sections 7.1 and 7.2). This shows
that even safe defaults may be insufﬁcient. Lynx attempts to check
for self-signed certiﬁcates, but misinterprets the meaning of return
values of GnuTLS’s certiﬁcate validation function and the check is
never executed (Section 7.4). Formalizing the precise semantics of
SSL library API and rigorously verifying the “contracts” between
the application and the library is an interesting topic for future re-
search and may call for programming language support.

DON’T delegate the responsibility for managing SSL connec-
tions to the applications. Existing SSL libraries expose many op-
tions to higher-level software. This is fraught with peril. Appli-
cation developers may not realize that they must explicitly choose
certain options in order to enable certiﬁcate validation. Therefore,
libraries should use safe defaults as much as possible. Furthermore,
they should not silently skip important functionality such as host-
name veriﬁcation as JSSE does when the algorithm ﬁeld is NULL
or an empty string (see Section 4.1). Instead, they should raise a
runtime exception or inform the application in some other way.

DO design a clean and consistent error reporting interface. Li-
braries such as OpenSSL and GnuTLS report some errors via re-
turn values of functions, while other errors from the same function
are reported through a ﬂag passed as an argument. Inconsistent in-
terfaces confuse developers who then mistakenly omit some error
checks in their applications.

These recommendations provide short-term ﬁxes. A principled
solution to the problem must involve a complete redesign of the
SSL libraries’ API. Instead of asking application developers to man-
age incomprehensible options such as CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER or
SSL_get_verify_result, they should present high-level abstrac-
tions that explicitly express security properties of network connec-
tions in terms that are close to application semantics: for exam-
ple, a “conﬁdential and authenticated tunnel.” The library should
also be explicit about the security consequences of any application-
controlled option: for example, instead of “verify hostname?”, it
could ask “Anyone can impersonate the server. Ok or not?”

12. RELATED WORK

Independently of this work, Kevin McArthur announced multi-
ple vulnerabilities caused by improper SSL certiﬁcate validation in
PHP software. 17 Affected programs include, among others, os-
Commerce, Ubercart, PrestaShop, and three PayPal SDKs.

Moxie Marlinspike demonstrated several vulnerabilities in cer-
tiﬁcate validation code in browsers and SSL libraries, including the
lack of basic constraint checking (e.g., checking the CA bit) [11]
and incorrect parsing of NULL characters in the “CommonName”
ﬁeld [12]. By contrast, we focus on non-browser software that uses
(mostly) correct SSL libraries incorrectly.

Kaminsky et al. [10] showed that parsing differences between
CA software and browser certiﬁcate validation code can result in a
CA issuing a certiﬁcate that can be used for a man-in-the-middle
attack. By contrast, we investigate certiﬁcate validation bugs in
non-browser clients, not in CA software.

Stevens et al. showed how an attacker can leverage MD5 hash
collisions to get a CA to issue a specially crafted certiﬁcate that is
valid for an ordinary host but whose hash collides with that of a
certiﬁcate for a new, rogue intermediate CA [18]. By contrast, our
attacks do not involve certiﬁcate forgery.

17http://www.unrest.ca/peerjacking

Several certiﬁcate authorities such as Comodo [5] and DigiNo-
tar [6] were recently compromised and used by attackers to issue
fake certiﬁcates for popular websites. By contrast, our attacks do
not involve CA compromise.

To mitigate the risks of rogue certiﬁcates, Evans et al. proposed
certiﬁcate pinning, i.e., pre-established bindings in the browser be-
tween well-known websites and their certiﬁcates [8]. Certiﬁcate
pinning is not supported by any of the software we analyzed.

Several large-scale studies analyzed HTTPS deployment [7, 22]
and found many errors in SSL certiﬁcates. One of the most com-
mon errors is a mismatch between the server’s fully qualiﬁed do-
main name and certiﬁcate’s identiﬁers. This misconﬁguration alone
does not enable a man-in-the-middle attack.

Chen et al. showed how a malicious proxy can exploit browser
bugs for man-in-the-middle attacks on HTTPS [3]. By contrast, our
attacks do not depend on browser bugs.

Side-channel attacks can extract information from encrypted traf-
ﬁc even when SSL is correctly deployed [4, 19]. By contrast, we
found vulnerabilities that enable a man-in-the-middle attacker to
decrypt SSL trafﬁc, obviating the need for side-channel analysis.
Other side-channel attacks include a timing attack that extracts the
private key from OpenSSL implementations [2].

13. CONCLUSION

The main lesson of this paper is that using SSL in non-browser
software is a surprisingly challenging task. We demonstrated that
even applications that rely on standard SSL libraries such as JSSE,
OpenSSL, GnuTLS, etc. often perform SSL certiﬁcate validation
incorrectly or not at all. These vulnerabilities are pervasive in crit-
ical software, such as Amazon FPS and PayPal libraries for trans-
mitting customers’ payment details from merchants to payment
gateways; integrated shopping carts; Amazon EC2, Rackspace, and
other clients for remote administration of cloud storage and virtual
cloud infrastructure; Chase mobile banking on Android; and many
other popular programs. Their SSL connections are completely in-
secure against a man-in-the-middle attack.

We also presented our recommendations for safer use of SSL in
non-browser software. Future research directions include (1) de-
velopment of better black-box testing and code analysis tools for
discovering errors in SSL connection establishment logic, (2) de-
sign of formal veriﬁcation techniques and programming language
support for automatically checking whether applications use SSL
libraries correctly and not misinterpret the meaning of critical op-
tions and parameters, and (3) design of better APIs for SSL and
other secure networking protocols.
