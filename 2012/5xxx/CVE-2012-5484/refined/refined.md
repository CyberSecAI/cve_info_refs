  "CVE-2012-5484": {
    "Description": "A weakness was found in the way IPA clients communicated with IPA servers when initially attempting to join IPA domains. As there was no secure way to provide the IPA server's Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to the client during a join, the IPA client enrollment process was susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. This flaw could allow an attacker to obtain access to the IPA server using the credentials provided by an IPA client, including administrative access to the entire domain if the join was performed using an administrator's credentials.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of secure method to provide the IPA server's CA certificate to the client during the initial join process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The IPA client did not have the CA certificate of the server during initial join.",
      "The initial communication to retrieve the CA certificate was susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could gain access to the IPA server, potentially including administrative access if the join was performed using administrative credentials. With OTP (one-time password) an attacker could only gain unprivileged access.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack during the initial IPA client join process by intercepting and hijacking the initial communication.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to spoof DNS names of the IPA server or redirect network traffic during the initial join process.",
      "Ability to intercept and subvert SSL communication while the client retrieves the CA certificate."
    ],
  "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability is exposed only during the initial client join to the realm, not for further communication after obtaining the CA certificate.",
        "When a fix for this flaw has been applied to the client but not yet the server, ipa-client-install in unattended mode, will fail if you do not have the correct CA certificate locally.",
        "The fix involves downloading the CA certificate via a mutually authenticated LDAP connection or by providing the CA certificate through an external method."
