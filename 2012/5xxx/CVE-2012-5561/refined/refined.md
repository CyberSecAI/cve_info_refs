{
  "CVE-2012-5561": {
    "Description": "The `/usr/share/katello/script/katello-generate-passphrase` utility, which is run during the installation and configuration process, set world-readable permissions on the `/etc/katello/secure/passphrase` file. A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain the passphrase for Katello, giving them access to information they would otherwise not have access to.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `katello-generate-passphrase` script created the passphrase file with world-readable permissions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure file permissions allowing unauthorized access.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could read the passphrase file and gain access to sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the server where the `katello-generate-passphrase` utility is used during the installation process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the machine where Katello is installed and the vulnerable file exists."
