Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-5387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability within the White Label CMS plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to potentially force a logged-in administrator to perform unwanted actions.
- **Persistent XSS:** The provided exploit also demonstrates a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is related to CVE-2012-5388. However, the CSRF (CVE-2012-5387) vulnerability can be used to trigger the XSS, which is included in the exploit payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker can use the CSRF vulnerability to modify the plugin settings.
-   Combined with the persistent XSS, this allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of other users accessing the WordPress admin panel. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The primary attack vector is through a crafted HTML page or link that triggers a CSRF request when visited by a logged-in administrator. This request then modifies plugin settings to inject malicious JavaScript via XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a crafted page or link controlled by the attacker.
-   No prior authentication to the WordPress site is required for the CSRF attack itself. However, an administrator session must exist in the browser of the victim at the time the malicious request is made.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit uses an image tag to trigger the CSRF vulnerability. This is a common method used in CSRF attacks, as it does not require user interaction beyond loading the page.
- The exploit targets version 1.5 of the White Label CMS plugin and leverages the `wlcms_o_developer_name` parameter to inject the XSS payload.
- The exploit-db entry mentions both CVE-2012-5387 (CSRF) and CVE-2012-5388 (XSS), indicating that the CSRF can be used to facilitate the XSS.

The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description, particularly the specific vulnerable parameters and the way the CSRF attack is used to inject the XSS payload.
