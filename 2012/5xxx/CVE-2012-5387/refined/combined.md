## Description

The White Label CMS plugin is for developers who want to give their clients a more personalised and less confusing content management system.

For a overview of the changes in 2.0 version of the plugin please visit the Video User Manuals website.

#### Features

* Customize the login page
* Add your branding to the header and footer
* Customize the dashboard
* Control which menus appear for your client
* Setting up a customized dashboard can be done in seconds using the White Label CMS Wizard

#### Customize The Login Page

Impress your clients with a branded login page. Add yours or your client‚Äôs logo, add a background image and even control the CSS if you wish. Personalising the back end of WordPress will give your client the feeling that this is their website, not a generic website.

#### Add Your Branding to the Header and Footer

Stay top of mind with your client by adding your branding to the admin bar, menu or footer.

#### Customize the Dashboard

Are you tired of telling your clients to ignore everything on the Dashboard, but then still receive questions because they‚Äôre confused or have broken something?

With White Label CMS you can clear everything from the dashboard and add in your own dashboard panel. You can even add your own RSS feed so your clients can be kept up to date with what you are doing in your business. Which is much more relevant to your client than where and when the next WordPress Meetup is.

Add your own welcome dashboard, and now you can use an Elementor or Beaver Builder template to make it look beautiful.

#### Control with Menus Appear for Your Client

We have created a new feature called the White Label CMS admin which allows you to hide menus for other users. Setup is simple and gives clients admin access with some restrictions making it harder for them to stumble across settings and mess up the site.

#### Setup a Site in Seconds Using the Wizard

Setting up a customized dashboard is easy and quick using the White Label CMS Wizard. With just a few clicks, you can add your branding and your client‚Äôs details and be up and running in seconds.

There is so much that you can do with White Label CMS, but we want the experience to be simple. The Wizard allows you to set up a clutter-free, customized dashboard without having to scroll through all of the options that are available to you.

## Installation

1. Download the White Label CMS plugin
2. Upload it to your plugins directory
3. Go to the plugins directory and activate the plugin
4. Go to Settings->White Label CMS and use the menu system to change the default values.

## FAQ

### Who is this plugin for?

For developers who handover websites to their clients and use WordPress as a CMS.

### How do I add links to my own panel?

Your custom panel accepts html, so just write the markup as you normally would in html.

### How do you recommend using this plugin?

We have been using this for a number of months now, and we have found clients respond best when it is set up in the following fashion:

* Use the clients logo for the login (it gives the CMS a bit of a wow factor!)
* Use the clients logo in the header
* Use your own logo in the footer, and place a link back to your website
* Remove all panels from the dashboard (they have a lot of information that just confuses the client)
* Add your own panel. Personalise the experience for your client by welcoming them to their website. Provide links to the most relevant elements in the CMS. Provide a link back to your support system if you have one.

### [Pretty much a full featured white label plugin! Love it!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pretty-much-a-full-featured-white-label-plugin-love-it/)

I‚Äôve spent the past few hours installing/uninstalling & testing probably all white label and custom admin plugins currently available in the repository.
I needed a few simple features, hide some admin menu items, hide some admin toolbar items, customise login page, remove default widgets and add a couple of custom widgets.
Unlike all other plugins in the repository, this plugin does it all, out of the box and without asking for a Pro version. UI looks great, nice & easy to look at, and simple to work with.
Excellent work guys and many thanks for making this available for free. üôè

Having the ability to now add a Page as an option to the Welcome Dashboard Panel sets this plugin on top of the heap!

This White Label CMS plugin pleasantly surprised me! It made it possible to create a fully customized dashboard for my client, allowing him to manage his website content (posts, pages, tags, categories, etc.) while incorporating my branding, including the login interface.
Another interesting point: I customized my WP Log In URL (instead of using wp-admin), and it worked well.
I was already familiar with other plugins offering similar functions, but White Label CMS stands out for its cleanliness and simplicity!
Thanks and keep up the excellent work!

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
