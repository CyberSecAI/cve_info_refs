Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-5481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the "Check Permissions" page of Moodle. This page was designed to display user capabilities within a specific course or category. However, it was improperly implemented, leading to an information leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness was a lack of proper access control on the "Check Permissions" page. It failed to restrict the display of user capabilities based on the user's own permissions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed users without the `moodle/role:manage` capability (typically non-admin users) to view the capabilities of all users across the entire Moodle instance, instead of only within their course or category.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** The main impact was the disclosure of sensitive information. Unauthorized users could gain insight into the roles and capabilities of all users on the Moodle platform, which could be useful for further attacks or social engineering.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  The unauthorized access to user capabilities represented a privacy violation, as it revealed information that users might expect to be kept private.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** An attacker could simply navigate to the "Check Permissions" page and view the user list. No special interaction was required by the attacker other than having an account on the Moodle platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Moodle Account:** The attacker needed a valid user account on the affected Moodle instance. They did not need administrative privileges, nor did they need to be enrolled in a particular course or category, as the vulnerability was that the permission check did not limit the view based on context.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker only needed to be aware of the existence of the "Check Permissions" page to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was considered a minor severity risk.
*   The vulnerability affected Moodle versions 2.3 to 2.3.2+.
*   The fix involved limiting access for teachers to do permission checks of their own students within the scope of a given course (context)
