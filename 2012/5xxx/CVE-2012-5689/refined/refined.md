{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2012-5689",
    "description": "A flaw was found in the DNS64 implementation in BIND when using Response Policy Zones (RPZ). If a remote attacker sent a specially-crafted query to a named server that is using RPZ rewrite rules, named could exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.",
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to a coding error in the interaction between the RPZ database and the DNS64 remapping code when handling AAAA lookups for records with A record rewrite rules in RPZ.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of DNS64 and RPZ interactions",
      "Assertion failure leading to unexpected program termination"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially-crafted DNS query, causing the named process to terminate unexpectedly.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted DNS query to a server configured with both DNS64 and RPZ rewrite rules (specifically A record rewrite rules, without corresponding AAAA rules)",
      "Remote exploitation via network traffic"
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted DNS queries to the vulnerable server. The vulnerable server must have DNS64 and Response Policy Zones (RPZ) configured."
