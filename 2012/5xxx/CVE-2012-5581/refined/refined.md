Sidhpurwala    2012-10-17 06:13:21 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtiff handled DOTRANGE tags. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file  that, when opened, would cause an application linked against libtiff to crash  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.   This issue is fixed in libtiff-4.0.2   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c6)  Tom Lane    2012-10-30 16:23:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c5)) > Yeah.  I see that libtiff 4.0.x has completely rewritten the special cases > for DOTRANGE, but it's not clear whether that dodges this problem or not --  Turns out that indeed 4.0.3 does not crash.  It looks like these upstream commits were specifically intended to repair this type of problem:  2012-06-06 00:56:01  fwarmerdam  	* ChangeLog, libtiff/tif_dir.c: avoid special handling of 	PAGENUMBER, HALFTONEHINTS, YCBCRSUBSAMPLING and DOTRANGE in 	non-image directories  2012-06-06 02:06:20  fwarmerdam  	* ChangeLog, libtiff/tif_print.c: improve handling of PAGENUMBER, 	HALFTONEHINTS, YCBCRSUBSAMPLING and DOTRANGE  2012-06-08 01:15:21  fwarmerdam  	* ChangeLog, libtiff/tif_print.c: avoid pretty printing values 	without proper rawdata  I'm not sure about the backwards compatibility implications if we apply these patches --- it seems at least theoretically possible that some apps out there are expecting the original behavior of GetField/SetField.  On the other hand, it's unclear that there is any way to fix this crash without a behavioral change.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c11)  Huzaifa S.

However, the only apparent alternative is to leave the bug unfixed, which is even less attractive.  The saving grace is that the case where an application might have a compatibility problem would be where it had special-case code to handle DotRange or one of the other \"weird\" TIFF tags whose behavior has been simplified by the patch. Such applications are probably very few and far between, since these tags are little-used.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-18 21:10:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1590 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1590.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c21)  Huzaifa S.
