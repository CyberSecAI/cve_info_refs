Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of temporary files within the `xdiagnose` tool, specifically in the `welcome.py` script. The script was using a hardcoded `/tmp` directory to store temporary files before creating an archive. This made it vulnerable to symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The code uses a predictable location `/tmp` to store files, creating a race condition where an attacker can create a symlink with the same name in the `/tmp` directory before the application creates the actual file, causing it to write to an attacker-controlled location instead.
- **Symlink vulnerability:** Specifically, the `shutils.copy` and `execute` operations use a directory within `/tmp` without properly verifying it. This allows a local attacker to create a symlink within /tmp before the application executes these commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By exploiting the symlink vulnerability, an attacker can cause the `xdiagnose` tool to overwrite arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to denial of service, privilege escalation, or other malicious outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user who has the ability to create files in `/tmp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks within the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the `welcome.py` script which was not actively used by `xdiagnose`, however, it could be included by third-party applications
*   The primary vulnerability was in the `on_make_archive` function of the `welcome.py` script which was a partial rewrite of the Failsafe-X functionality, but not fully implemented
*   The official fix was to remove the vulnerable code from the `welcome.py` script
*   The main Failsafe-X code used a safer approach via `mktemp` and did not require patching but that functionality was also removed
*   Ubuntu's kernel hardening with Yama should prevent attacks against xdiagnose, this update was done to prevent issues with third party applications using the vulnerable code.
