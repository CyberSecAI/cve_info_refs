How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Thank you for using Ubuntu and reporting a bug. Ubuntu's kernel hardening should prevent attacks against xdiagnose. So I'll mark this as Low for now. Subscribing Bryce.

Please raise the priority! It's not clear at all why we should assume that kernel hardening will guarantee that no path writable by the process in a symlink attack will be harmful. And I don't believe there is any apparmor rules for this in any case.

Because it's a security issue, it should be fixed, and not just postponed until some other security task is done.

Bryce can you comment on the patch? As written, it won't clean up after itself and there is a TODO in the code to implement this in the way Alec suggested. I'm not sure why it wasn't implemented like this to begin with if there wasn't some cleanup or other reason that needed to also be done.

Yeah, sheer laziness on my part.

This bit of code is actually exceedingly unimportant. The tarball that is generated is purely for the user's use and is not uploaded anywhere or made use of in any form by xdiagnose. It was a community contribution from back in the days before we had a decent X apport hook. Now days we'd just have them file a bug via ubuntu-bug xorg. I suppose users might not have apport turned on or something, so this might conceivably still be of some use, however I see the function's begun to bitrot: it's looking for gdm rather than lightdm.

So, I think the right thing to do here is rather than fix the temp file, to just excise the functionality and focus on apport as the way to gather troubleshooting info.

Yeah, sheer laziness on my part.
This bit of code is actually exceedingly unimportant. The tarball that is generated is purely for the user's use and is not uploaded anywhere or made use of in any form by xdiagnose. It was a community contribution from back in the days before we had a decent X apport hook. Now days we'd just have them file a bug via ubuntu-bug xorg.

Note that the original patch is against welcome.py, which isn't used by anything. The code is a partial rewrite of Failsafe-X into python, but it's still not quite done so I haven't switched over to it. And like I mentioned, that particular functionality is obsolete by apport now so should just go.

I've posted three commits to xdiagnose trunk:

<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bryce/xdiagnose/trunk/revision/307>

 - This one just gets rid of the code from welcome.py. This is probably adequate to eliminate the security issue. Since like I said, this is not user facing at all, it causes no functional loss and thus should be no risk to backport to precise.

<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bryce/xdiagnose/trunk/revision/306>

 - This drops the same functionality from the actual failsafe-X code that is user facing. This particular chunk of code doesn't have the security flaw (it calls mktemp properly). So not really a need to backport this. But you're welcome to if you'd like. I've tested that failsafe-x still works properly with this removed.

<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bryce/xdiagnose/trunk/revision/308>

 - Changelog updates for above two changes.

jdstrand, go ahead and pick what you want from the above for past releases.

I'll roll the above out to quantal either today or tomorrow.

# USN-1591-1: xdiagnose update

2 October 2012

3rd party applications using xdiagnose could potentially be made to
overwrite files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [xdiagnose](/security/cves?package=xdiagnose) - X.org diagnosis tool

## Details

Alec Warner discovered that xdiagnose improperly handled temporary files

in welcome.py when creating user-initiated archive files. While failsafeX

does not use the vulnerable code, this update removes this functionality to

protect any 3rd party applications which import the vulnerable code. In the

default Ubuntu installation, this should be prevented by the Yama link

restrictions.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [xdiagnose](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xdiagnose)
  -
  [2.5.2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xdiagnose/2.5.2ubuntu0.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

### Join the discussion

* [Ubuntu security updates mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-hardened)
* [Security announcements mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce)

### Need help with your security needs?

Ubuntu Pro provides up to ten-year security coverage for over 23,000 open-source packages within the Ubuntu Main and Universe repositories.
