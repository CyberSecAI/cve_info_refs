Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-5533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `http_request_split_value` function in the `request.c` file of lighttpd. This function is responsible for parsing header values that contain comma-separated tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is an infinite loop that occurs when the `http_request_split_value` function encounters an empty token (e.g., ",,"). In lighttpd versions prior to 1.4.32, the function would not properly handle consecutive commas, leading to a loop that would not terminate. Specifically, the parser would detect the empty token, but not increment the current string position, so it would read the same comma again and again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service. Because lighttpd is single-threaded, the infinite loop in the parsing function will block all request handling by the server, effectively making it unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request containing a header with an empty token, such as "Connection: TE,,Keep-Alive". The specific example in the exploit is `Connection: TE,,Keep-Alive`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the lighttpd server.
- **HTTP Request Sending:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in lighttpd version 1.4.31.
- The fix for the vulnerability includes a rewrite of the vulnerable function.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jesse Sipprell from McClatchy Interactive, Inc.

- Versions affected: lighttpd before 1.4.32
