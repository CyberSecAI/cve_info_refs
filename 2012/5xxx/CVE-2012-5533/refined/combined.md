How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RESOLUTION

HP has made the following updates available to resolve the vulnerability in
HP Remote Device Access: Virtual Customer Access System (vCAS) running
lighttpd.

  Customers should upgrade their vCAS systems using the web UI or the
"casupdate" command.

  There are also new VirtualBox and VMware ESX images available:

    - VMware ESX/ESXi image:
<https://h20529.www2.hp.com/apt/hp-rdacas-14.10-38402.ova>

    - VirtualBox image:
<https://h20529.www2.hp.com/apt/hp-rdacas-14.10-38402-vbox.ova>

    NOTES:

      - HP recommends to not power-down or disconnect the vCAS until the
update is available.
      - The vCAS pulls down the latest updates from HP by using Ubuntus
apt-get facility.
      - HP does not push updates out on to the vCAS so customers will have to
be proactive and install the latest updates.

  Actions Required

    Download updates by using a web browser:
      1. Connect to the vCAS and login as hp-admin
      2. Go to Tools -> Software Updates
      3. Under "Manual Actions" select Check now and then upgrade now

    See HP Remote Device Access vCAS User Guide, Chapter 4, Software Updates
for more details:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8210#c0)  David Walser    2012-11-26 17:00:28 CET  ``` OpenSuSE has issued an advisory on November 23: <http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2012-11/msg00044.html>  This was fixed upstream in 1.4.32, so Cauldron is not affected.  Patched package uploaded for Mageia 1 and Mageia 2.  Advisory: ========================  Updated lighttpd packages fix security vulnerability:  The http_request_split_value function in request.c in lighttpd before 1.4.32 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a request with a header containing an empty token, as demonstrated using the "Connection: TE,,Keep-Alive" header (CVE-2012-5533).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: lighttpd 1.4.32 released, fixing CVE-2012-5533

Hi,

we just released lighttpd 1.4.32, fixing a DoS reported by Jesse
Sipprell from McClatchy Interactive, Inc.

Sending "Connection: TE,,Keep-Alive" as header will trigger an endless
loop; as lighttpd is single threaded all request handling will stop
immediately.

Only lighttpd 1.4.31 is affected by this.

For more details and other changes see:
* <http://www.lighttpd.net/2012/11/21/1-4-32/>
* <http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa_2012_01.txt>

Stefan

 Denial of Service - endless loop in parsing Connection header
===============================================================
CVE-2012-5533 [1] was assigned to this bug.
Description
-------------
Certain Connection header values will trigger an endless loop, for
example:
"Connection: TE,,Keep-Alive"
Thanks to Jesse Sipprell from McClatchy Interactive, Inc. for reporting
this issue.
Detailed analysis
-------------------
On receiving such value, lighttpd will enter an endless loop,
detecting an empty token but not incrementing the current string
position, and keep reading the ',' again and again.
This bug was introduced [2] in 1.4.31, when we fixed an "invalid read"
bug [3] (it would try to read the byte before the string if it started
with ',', although the value wasn't actually used).
The patch includes a complete rewrite of the vulnerable function; the new
function should work with all older releases as well - the interface didn't
change.
Affected versions
-------------------
Only 1.4.31; on the other hand versions before 1.4.31 include the "invalid read" bug.
Patch
-------
See http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd-1.4.31\_fix\_connection\_header\_dos.patch
Fixed in
----------
1.4.x: http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/2860
1.4.32: http://www.lighttpd.net/2012/11/21/1-4-32
Solutions or Workaround
-------------------------
There is no workaround.
