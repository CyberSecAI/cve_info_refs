{
  "CVE-2012-5606": {
    "Description": "Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in ownCloud 4.5.2 and 4.0.9. The specific vulnerable locations are in filelist.js and versions.js, where user input is not properly sanitized before being used in HTML output.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data before using it in HTML output within the JavaScript files `filelist.js` and `versions.js`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which will then be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts by manipulating the input fields or parameters that are then used to generate HTML output. For `filelist.js`, the vulnerability is triggered by crafted file names, while for `versions.js` it is triggered by the file list parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to either upload files with malicious names or be able to manipulate the parameters that are used to load file versions through the file system and inject malicious JavaScript code.",
    "Additional Details": [
      "The commit `e5f2d46` addresses XSS vulnerabilities in `apps/files/js/filelist.js` by adding HTML escaping to the file name, extension, and notification messages.",
      "The commit `e45f36c` addresses XSS in `apps/files_versions/js/versions.js` by applying HTML escaping to the file list parameter.",
      "The commit `ce66759` addresses XSS in `3rdparty/fullcalendar/js/fullcalendar.js` by adding HTML escaping to the event title."
