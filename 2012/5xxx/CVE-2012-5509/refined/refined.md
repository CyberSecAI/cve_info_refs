Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `aeolus-configserver-setup` script creates a temporary file in the `/tmp` directory. This file contains sensitive credentials (key/secret).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The script creates a temporary file in a shared directory (`/tmp`) without proper access control.
- **Credentials Exposure:** The temporary file stores sensitive credentials in clear text, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Insufficient Permissions:** The created temporary file has permissions `755`, which allows any user on the system to read the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Leakage:** An attacker could gain access to the sensitive credentials contained in the temporary file.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With the stolen credentials, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to systems or services protected by those credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system can read the temporary file created by `aeolus-configserver-setup` and obtain the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs local access to the system where `aeolus-configserver-setup` has been executed. The attacker does not need root privileges to read the temporary file due to the file permissions.

**Additional Notes**

- The bug report indicates the issue was found in `aeolus-configserver` version `0.4.11-1.el6cf.noarch`.
- The bug was fixed in the `CloudForms for RHEL 6` product and addressed by `RHSA-2013:0545`.
