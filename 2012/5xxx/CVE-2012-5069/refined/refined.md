Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `java.util.concurrent.Executors` class failed to properly maintain the class loader state in the `PrivilegedCallableUsingCurrentClassLoader` class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of class loader state in concurrent executors.
- Allows an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Security bypass of Java sandbox restrictions.
- Potential for an attacker to perform unauthorized actions by circumventing security checks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Remote execution via an untrusted Java application or applet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to deploy or cause the execution of a malicious Java application or applet.
- No authentication or special permissions are needed by the attacker to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability exists because the `Executors` class did not properly manage class loader states when creating `PrivilegedCallableUsingCurrentClassLoader` instances. This allows untrusted code to possibly execute with unintended privileges and circumvent intended security restrictions.

**Additional Notes:**

The vulnerability was addressed in OpenJDK versions included in the following:

- Oracle JDK 7u9 and 6u37
- IcedTea6 versions 1.10.10 and 1.11.5
- IcedTea7 versions 2.1.3, 2.2.3, and 2.3.3
- Several Red Hat Enterprise Linux errata, including RHSA-2012:1384, RHSA-2012:1385, RHSA-2012:1386, RHSA-2012:1391, RHSA-2012:1392, RHSA-2012:1465, RHSA-2012:1466, RHSA-2012:1467, RHSA-2013:1455 and RHSA-2013:1456.

The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "high" by Red Hat Bugzilla and "critical" by Red Hat Security Advisories.

The vulnerability also affects IBM Java 1.5.0, 1.6.0, and 1.7.0 and is addressed by various IBM security fixes.
