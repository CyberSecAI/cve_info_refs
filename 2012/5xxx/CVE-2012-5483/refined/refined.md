A file permissions flaw in Keystone allowed a local attacker to view the administrative access and secret values used for authenticating requests to Amazon EC2 services.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure file permissions on `/etc/keystone/ec2rc` file, which was world-readable
- The `/etc/keystone/` directory was also world readable

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could use the exposed credentials to access Amazon EC2 and enable, disable, and modify services and settings.

Attack vectors:
- Local access to the system

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local access to the system
