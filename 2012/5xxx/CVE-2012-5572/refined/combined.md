## Description

[![@vlet](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380909?v=4&size=48)](/vlet)[vlet](https://github.com/vlet)opened [on Nov 15, 2012](https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues/859#issue-8385111)

Today was announced new CGI.pm 3.63 were was fixed issue (marked as

security issue in Changes) with CRLF injection in cookies:

<https://github.com/markstos/CGI.pm/pull/23>

As I can see Dancer::Cookie also do not validate cookie name for

CRLF and other invalid symbols in headers. This may be a security issue if

cookie name taken from untrusted source.

$ perl -MDancer -e 'get "/" => sub { cookie "test\n\rX-Evil-Header: " => "evil" };dance' &

$ echo "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | netcat 127.0.0.1 3000

HTTP/1.0 200 OK

Server: Perl Dancer 1.311

Content-Length: 4

Content-Type: text/html

Set-Cookie: test

X-Evil-Header: =evil; path=/; HttpOnly

X-Powered-By: Perl Dancer 1.311
