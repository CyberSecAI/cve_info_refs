Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5491:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `widget_traversal.py` file in Plone. This file is used for traversing and accessing widgets in the Plone framework.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-749:**  This indicates a "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls" issue. This means the code might not be properly checking user permissions or access rights before performing certain operations on widgets.
- The provided context suggests that this vulnerability is related to a broader hotfix that addresses multiple security issues in Plone, which are detailed with individual CVE assignments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploitation could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of widgets within Plone.
- Due to the CWE-749 classification, it can be inferred that a malicious actor might be able to perform actions on widgets that they should not have permission to, potentially leading to data manipulation, information disclosure, or other forms of unauthorized activity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would likely involve sending crafted requests to the Plone application that target the `widget_traversal.py` file.
- By exploiting the improper permission checks, the attacker could potentially bypass access restrictions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have some level of access to the Plone application. This could mean being a registered user with some existing rights, or potentially even an unauthenticated user if the vulnerability allows it.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Plone application, likely through HTTP requests.
- Knowledge of how Plone widgets are accessed is needed.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text also mentions "CWE-79" which is Cross-Site Scripting, however, the email correspondence on openwall.com only lists CWE-749 as vulnerability for CVE-2012-5491, whereas CVE-2012-5504 addresses a separate `widget_traversal.py` issue with CWE-749 and CWE-79.
- The associated fix was released as part of the PloneHotfix20121106
- The vulnerability was identified by David Glick from the Plone Security Team.
