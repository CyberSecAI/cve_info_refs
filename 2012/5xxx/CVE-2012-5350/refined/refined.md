Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter within the `paywithtweet` shortcode is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.
*   **Multiple XSS:** The `pay.php` file is vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues. This is due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `link`, `title`, and `dl` parameters within the `pay.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the shortcode `id` parameter, potentially leading to data extraction or modification.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page, which can then be executed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Unauthorized access to database information.
    *   Potential data manipulation or deletion.
    *   Compromise of the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Execution of malicious scripts in a user's browser.
    *   Cookie stealing or session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the target site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attacker crafts a malicious `id` parameter within the `paywithtweet` shortcode, embedding SQL injection payloads.
*   **XSS:**  Attacker crafts malicious URLs with specific parameters (`link`, `title`, and `dl`) containing javascript code to be injected into the `pay.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Ability to create or edit posts/pages where the vulnerable shortcode can be used.
*   **XSS:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send the maliciously crafted URL with the vulnerable parameters to potential victims.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The 'Pay with Tweet' plugin was closed on February 27, 2012 and is not available for download.
*   The exploit-db entry mentions both CVE-2012-5350 and CVE-2012-5349.
*   The exploit-db entry provides Proof of Concept (PoC) code.
