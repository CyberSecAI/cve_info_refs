| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=789834#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2012-11-15 16:17:37 UTC  ``` is public, via oss-sec  CVE-2012-5521  From: Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@redhat.com> Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2012 09:48:59 -0500 (EST) Subject: [oss-security] CVE Request -- quagga (ospf6d): Assertion failure when removing routes (retrieving information which route to remove)  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    Marco d'Itri in Debian bug [1] has reported the following deficiency, being present in 0.99.21 and possibly earlier versions of the Quagga  routing suite:  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Quagga's ospf6d daemon performed routes removal. In certain circumstances when removing the route the ospf6d daemon terminated with assertion failure when trying to determine / find, which route to remove. An OSPF6 router could use this flaw to cause ospf6d on an adjacent router to abort.  References: [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=693102> [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=876197>  Upstream bug report: [3] <https://bugzilla.quagga.net/show_bug.cgi?id=747>  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=789834#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2012-11-15 16:18:19 UTC  ``` The SWAMPID for this issue is 50109. This issue was rated as moderate. Please submit fixed packages until 2012-11-29. When done, please reassign the bug to security-team@suse.de. Patchinfo will be handled by security team. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=789834#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2012-11-15 23:00:40 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=789834#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2012-11-28 10:34:53 UTC  ``` I tried to make sense of the code and why it crashes ... but with just the backtrace it is hard for me either.  (canceling swamp until we have a valid fix) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=789834#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2013-08-19 08:27:25 UTC  ``` The SWAMPID for this issue is 54111. This issue was rated as moderate. Please submit fixed packages until 2013-09-02. When done, please reassign the bug to security-team@suse.de.

We'll close this for now. The bug was mentioned in the SWAMP and no further information is available. ``` |  |

In certain circumstances when removing the route the ospf6d daemon terminated with assertion failure when trying to determine / find, which route to remove. An OSPF6 router could use this flaw to cause ospf6d on an adjacent router to abort.

Hallo

Did you already discuss this with the upstream authors or should I
forward the bug?

No, I am sorry but I do not feel like crashing my network right now. :-)
I recommend that they build an Olive and try that in a lab.

This is the configuration that I used:

interfaces {
    irb {
        unit 42 {
            family inet6 {
                address 2001:4b78:feff::2/64; # this breaks if I use /120
            }
        }
    }
}
protocols {
    ospf3 {
        area 0.0.0.0 {
            interface irb.42 {
                metric 350;
            }
        }
    }
}

This Juniper router is not directly connected to the quagga ones, there
are Cisco routers between them.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
