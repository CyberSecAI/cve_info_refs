  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2012-5627",
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in the handling of password salt values in MySQL. When a user logs into MySQL a salt value is generated that is then used to prevent password guessing attacks (since the salt value must be known in order to send a password). This salt value is created at the start of a session and used for the entire session, once authenticated an attacker can use the MySQL \"change_user\" command to attempt to login as a different, as the salt value is known a password guessing attack will be much more efficient.",
    "root_cause": "Re-use of the same salt value during a MySQL session when using the 'change_user' command.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure salt usage",
       "Predictable salt value during a session"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a more efficient password guessing attack.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker with an existing valid MySQL login can use the 'change_user' command within the same session to attempt to authenticate as a different user.",
    "required_capabilities": "Requires a valid, unprivileged MySQL login."
