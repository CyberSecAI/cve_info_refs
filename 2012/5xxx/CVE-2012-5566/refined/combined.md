Subject: CVE Request -- kronolith: Two sets (3.0.17 && 3.0.18) of XSS flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Horde upstream has recently released 3.0.18 version
of Kronolith, the Horde calendar application, correcting
one set of XSS flaws:
 [1] <https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/d3dda2d47fad7eb128a0091e732cded0c2601009/kronolith/docs/CHANGES>
 [2] <http://lists.horde.org/archives/announce/2012/000836.html>

more exactly:
* Set #1: [mms] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities in the portal blocks.
  Upstream patch: <http://git.horde.org/horde-git/-/commit/d865c564beb6e98532880aa51a04a79f3311cd1e>
  References: [1], [2] plus [3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=879684>

Also previously (in version 3.0.17 yet another set of XSS flaws got corrected):
* Set #2: [jan] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities in tasks view and search view (Bug #11189).
  Upstream ticket: [4] <http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/11189>
  Upstream patch:  [5] <http://git.horde.org/horde-git/-/commit/1228a6825a8dab3333d0a8c8986fc10d1f3d11b2>
  References: [1], [2], [4], [5]
  Note: There isn't a Red Hat Bugzilla entry, since the kronolith 2.x
        version based versions shipped, within Fedora / Fedora EPEL weren't
        vulnerable to this problem yet.

Look at MITRE CVE database for kronolith:
[6] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=kronolith>

suggests the last security flaws, a CVE ids has been assigned to, were the
following two:
* v2.2-RC2
--------

[jan] SECURITY: Fix privilege escalation in Horde API. => CVE-2008-7218
[cjh] SECURITY: Fix missing ownership validation on share changes => CVE-2008-7219

so both of sets of the XSS issues (Set #1, Set #2) should still be lacking
(two) CVE identifiers.

Could you allocate them?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
