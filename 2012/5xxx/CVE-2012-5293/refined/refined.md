- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability, caused by the insecure inclusion of external files via the `root_path` parameter in the `get_tree.inc.php` and `get_infochannel.inc.php` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized user input is passed to the include function, allowing for the inclusion of remote files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include malicious files from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP files (`get_tree.inc.php` and `get_infochannel.inc.php`) by manipulating the `root_path` parameter to point to a malicious remote file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application and host a malicious file on a publicly accessible server.
