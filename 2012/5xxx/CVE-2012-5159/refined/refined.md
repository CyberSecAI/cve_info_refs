Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A compromised mirror server on SourceForge.net was distributing a modified phpMyAdmin archive containing a backdoor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor:** The modified archive included a file named `server_sync.php` which acted as a backdoor, allowing remote code execution.
- **Modified JavaScript:** Another file, `js/cross_framing_protection.js`, was also modified. The purpose of this modification is not detailed but indicates further compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary impact is that an attacker can remotely execute PHP code on the server running the compromised phpMyAdmin instance. This allows full control over the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Download Mirror:** The attack vector involves users downloading phpMyAdmin from the compromised mirror (`cdnetworks-kr-1`). Users who downloaded the specific version `phpMyAdmin-3.5.2.2-all-languages.zip` from that mirror were vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromise of the mirror server:** The attacker had to compromise the SourceForge.net mirror server `cdnetworks-kr-1` to distribute the modified archive.
- **No user interaction needed**: The malicious code is executed after the user downloads and deploys the software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for full server compromise.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-661 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privilege) and CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')).
- The specific file name `server_sync.php` can be used to identify if a phpMyAdmin installation is compromised.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Tencent Security Response Center.
