{
  "CVE-2012-5514": {
    "Description": "The `guest_physmap_mark_populate_on_demand` function in Xen does not properly unlock the subject GFNs when checking if they are in use. This allows a local HVM guest administrator to cause a denial of service (hang).",
    "Root cause": "Missing unlock in `guest_physmap_mark_populate_on_demand()` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper resource handling",
      "Missing unlock operation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system hang).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Hypercall from a malicious guest domain"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Malicious guest administrator",
      "Ability to execute code within a HVM guest domain"
    ],
      "Additional Information": "The function checks if the subject GFNs are in use before its operation, but if this check fails, it bypasses the unlock operation, leading to a hang. This function is exposed to guests, which was deemed incorrect. It should only be exposed to privileged domains."
