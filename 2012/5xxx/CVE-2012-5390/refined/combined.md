# CONDOR-2012-0003

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| Condor installations that support Standard Universe jobs and run the daemons on the submit machine as root are vulnerable to local privilege escalation. If a user submits a job into the standard universe, the user job may then execute code on the submit machine as the root user. If your Condor installation does not contain the condor\_shadow.std executable, then you are not affected by this vulnerability. [CVE-2012-5390](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5390) | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Condor standard universe shadow | 7.7.3 to 7.7.6, 7.8.0 to 7.8.4, and 7.9.0 | Linux | not known to be publicly available | 7.8.5 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | ability to submit jobs to the condor\_schedd | n/a | low | high | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2012-Oct-22 | Zach MillerCondor team | | |
| Access Required: | ability to submit jobs |
| Any person who can submit standard universe jobs to the condor\_schedd can exploit this. Submissions are authenticated and are typically done locally. However, if Condor is configured to allow remote submits, jobs submitted remotely into the standard universe can also exploit this. | |
| Effort Required: | low |
| To exploit this, an attacker just needs to know the correct sequence of communications with the condor\_shadow.std. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | high |
| If an attacker is successfully able to communicate correctly with the condor\_shadow.std, they may instruct the shadow to run arbitrary code as the root user, including spawning additional processes. | |
| Cause: | Missing privilege check |
| Condor should never spawn user processes as root, and makes explicit checks in most places to ensure this never happens. In the standard universe shadow, an unrelated change opened a new code path where privilege checking did not exist. | |
| Proposed Fix: |  |
| Remove the code, as it should never be used. | |
| Actual Fix: |  |
| As proposed. | |
| Workaround: |  |
| If you do not need to run standard universe jobs, simply delete the condor\_shadow.std from your installation. | |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
