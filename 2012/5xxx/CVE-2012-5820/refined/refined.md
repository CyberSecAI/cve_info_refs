The provided content does not relate to a specific CVE, but instead provides a broad analysis of SSL certificate validation vulnerabilities in various non-browser applications and libraries. It highlights the pervasive nature of these vulnerabilities and their root causes. Therefore, this information is not specific to CVE-2012-5820.

Here's a summary of the findings from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Poorly Designed APIs:** SSL libraries (JSSE, OpenSSL, GnuTLS) expose low-level details instead of high-level security properties, leading to developer confusion and misuse.
*   **Misunderstanding of SSL Options:** Developers often misunderstand the various settings, parameters, and return values of SSL libraries and data transport libraries like cURL, leading to incorrect implementations.
*   **Silent Disabling of Validation:** Intermediate layers of the software stack or developers may intentionally or unintentionally disable certificate validation without proper awareness of the consequences.
*   **Incorrect Implementation of Hostname Verification:** Flawed custom hostname verification logic introduced by some libraries and applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Certificate Chain Validation:** Applications fail to properly verify the chain of trust from the server's certificate to a trusted root CA.
*   **Missing or Incorrect Hostname Verification:** Applications accept certificates that do not match the hostname of the server being connected to.
*   **Disabled Certificate Validation:** Applications explicitly disable certificate verification, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Misinterpretation of Error Codes:**  Developers often misunderstand how SSL libraries report errors, resulting in missed error checks.
*  **Insecure Defaults:** Some libraries have insecure defaults, requiring developers to take specific steps to enable proper validation which is often missed.
*  **Middleware Vulnerabilities:**  Web service middleware with broken SSL implementations expose applications using them to vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can intercept and decrypt communication between the client and server.
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can steal usernames, passwords, API keys, and other sensitive data.
*   **Financial Data Exposure:** Credit card numbers and other financial data can be harvested from e-commerce sites.
*   **Compromised Cloud Accounts:** Access to cloud storage and computing resources can be gained.
*   **Compromised Messaging Accounts:** Login credentials for instant messaging accounts can be stolen.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Interception:** Attackers control network infrastructure (routers, switches, Wi-Fi access points) or use DNS poisoning.
*   **Fake Server:** The attacker tricks the client into connecting to a malicious server.
*   **Spoofed Certificates:** The attacker presents a self-signed certificate, or a certificate from a third-party to the client with an incorrect or matching common name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Control:** The attacker must be able to intercept and redirect network traffic between the client and server.
*   **Certificate:** The attacker needs a valid certificate for their malicious server or must present a self-signed certificate.
*   **No Private Key Access Required:** The attacker does not need to compromise the private keys of legitimate servers or Certificate Authorities (CAs).

**Affected Software (Examples):**
*   Amazon EC2 Java library and related cloud clients
*   Amazon and PayPal merchant SDKs
*   osCommerce, ZenCart, Ubercart, and PrestaShop shopping carts
*   AdMob code used by mobile websites
*   Chase mobile banking app on Android
*   Apache Axis, Axis 2, Codehaus XFire Web service middleware
*   Pusher library for Android
*   Trillian instant messenger
*   Rackspace iOS client
*   Apache Libcloud
*   FilesAnywhere
*   Breezy, and ACRA Android apps

The content emphasizes that the vulnerabilities are due to logic errors in client-side SSL certificate validation, and they are often caused by developers misunderstanding or misusing the low-level details of SSL libraries.
