Customers running versions prior to   7.0 should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in   upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace conferencing solution provides functionality that allows organizations to host integrated voice, video, and web conferencing. The solution is deployed on network and integrated directly into an organization's private voice/data networks and enterprise applications. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace servers can be deployed so that the server is accessible from the Internet, allowing external parties to participate in meetings.      Web Conferencing is a core component of the Cisco   Unified MeetingPlace conferencing solution that allows users to share   applications and presentations and manage meetings.      **Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing SQL Injection Vulnerability**      The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing service contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject Structured Query Language (SQL) commands, that may affect the integrity and availability of the data stored in the MeetingPlace Web Conferencing internal database. This data may include server configurations, meetings, and users.    The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of some of the parameters passed through the HTTP POST method. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious SQL commands in the HTTP POST request directed to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete data from the Web Conferencing database.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtx08939](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx08939) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0337   **Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Buffer Overrun Vulnerability**      The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing service contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a buffer overrun condition that may cause the Web Conferencing server to become unresponsive.   The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of some parameter values of an HTTP POST request. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by crafting the value of the vulnerable parameters in an HTTP POST request directed to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Web Conferencing server to become unresponsive.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCua66341](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua66341) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-5416  Workarounds  * No workarounds are available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.      The following table contains the first fixed releases of software:      **Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing SQL Injection Vulnerability**             | **Vulnerability** | Major Release | First Fix In |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing SQL Injection Vulnerability - CSCtx08939 | 7.0 | 7.1MR1 |   | 7.1 | 7.1MR1 |   | 8.0 | 8.0MR1 Patch 1 |   | 8.5 | 8.5MR3 |       **Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Buffer Overrun Vulnerability**       | **Vulnerability** | Major Release | First Fix In |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CSCua66341 | 7.0 | 7.1MR1 Patch 1 |   | 7.1 | 7.1MR1 Patch 1 |   | 8.0 | 8.0MR1 Patch 1 |   | 8.5 | 8.5MR3 |        Recommended Releases The following table lists all recommended releases.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 8.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.
