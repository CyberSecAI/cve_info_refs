- **Root cause of vulnerability:** VMware Workstation and Player have a DLL binary planting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An attacker who can write a malicious executable to a system folder on the host, may be able to run code under certain circumstances. This indicates a weakness in how the applications load and handle DLLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The impact of successful exploitation could be arbitrary code execution on the host system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves an attacker gaining write access to a system folder, allowing them to plant a malicious DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to write files to a system folder on the host.
