| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-11-10 20:21:01 UTC  ``` When new node image is being created, vdsm.rpm is added to the node image and self-signed key (and certificate) is created. This key/cert allows vdsm to start and serve requests from anyone who has a matching key/cert which could be anybody holding the node image.  Upstream fix: <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/8368/>  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Dan Kenigsberg of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c1)  Petr Matousek    2012-11-10 20:26:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.  This issue did not affect the versions of vdsm22 package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This issue did not affect the versions of vdsm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This issue did not affect the hypervisor disk images as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c2)  Petr Matousek    2012-11-10 20:27:29 UTC  ``` Created vdsm tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 875368](show_bug.cgi?id=875368 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-5518 vdsm: certificate generation upon node creation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c3)  Fedora Update System    2013-03-12 08:58:19 UTC  ``` vdsm-4.10.0-13.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-11-10 20:21:01 UTC  ``` When new node image is being created, vdsm.rpm is added to the node image and self-signed key (and certificate) is created. This key/cert allows vdsm to start and serve requests from anyone who has a matching key/cert which could be anybody holding the node image.  Upstream fix: <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/8368/>  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Dan Kenigsberg of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c1)  Petr Matousek    2012-11-10 20:26:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.  This issue did not affect the versions of vdsm22 package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This issue did not affect the versions of vdsm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This issue did not affect the hypervisor disk images as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c2)  Petr Matousek    2012-11-10 20:27:29 UTC  ``` Created vdsm tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 875368](show_bug.cgi?id=875368 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-5518 vdsm: certificate generation upon node creation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=875367#c3)  Fedora Update System    2013-03-12 08:58:19 UTC  ``` vdsm-4.10.0-13.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.
