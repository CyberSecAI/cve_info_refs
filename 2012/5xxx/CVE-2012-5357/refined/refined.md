Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the insecure usage of the `XslCompiledTransform` class in Ektron CMS. Specifically, the system improperly handles user-controlled XSL data. This means that an attacker can provide malicious XSLT code that the system processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of User-Controlled Data:** The system fails to adequately sanitize or validate XSLT input provided by users.
*   **Insecure use of XSLT:** The vulnerability exists due to the unsafe use of `XslCompiledTransform`, which can be exploited when processing user-supplied XSLT.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*  **Denial of Service:** An attacker could also cause a denial of service condition.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The code is executed in the security context of the service running on the web server, potentially granting the attacker the privileges associated with that service. In the example given in the Rapid7 content the code executes with NETWORK SERVICE privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted request to the server running Ektron CMS that contains malicious XSLT.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running Ektron CMS.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in Ektron CMS 8.02 Service Pack 4 and earlier. It was fixed in Service Pack 5.
* This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Microsoft Vulnerability Research.
* The exploit is available as a Metasploit module.
