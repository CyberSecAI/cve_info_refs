### Ektron 8.02 XSLT Transform Remote Code Execution

Disclosed
10/16/2012

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits a vulnerability in Ektron CMS 8.02 (before SP5). The
vulnerability exists due to the insecure usage of XslCompiledTransform, using a
XSLT controlled by the user. The module has been tested successfully on Ektron CMS
8.02 over Windows 2003 SP2, which allows to execute arbitrary code with NETWORK
SERVICE privileges.

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/http/ektron_xslt_exec
msf exploit(ektron_xslt_exec) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(ektron_xslt_exec) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(ektron_xslt_exec) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(ektron_xslt_exec) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

## Vulnerabilities in Ektron CMS Could Allow Arbitrary Code Execution

Published: October 16, 2012 | Updated: November 14, 2012

**Version:** 1.1

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of two vulnerabilities affecting Ektron Web Content Management System (CMS). Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the affected vendor, Ektron. Ektron has remediated these vulnerabilities in their software.

The first vulnerability exists when Ektron Web CMS improperly handles user-controlled XSL data within the XslCompiledTransform class, resulting in unauthenticated arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been assigned the entry, CVE-2012-5357, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list.

The second vulnerability exists in the XSLTCompiledTransform function, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication. This vulnerability has been assigned the entry, CVE-2012-5358, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with Ektron to ensure remediation of this issue. For more information, including information about updates from Ektron, see the latest [Ektron Product Release Notes](https://documentation.ektron.com/current/releasenotes/releasenotes_webhelp.htm). For more information from Ektron about remediation of this issue, see the [Ektron Product Release Notes for Version 8.02 SP5](https://documentation.ektron.com/current/releasenotes/release8/8.02sp5.htm).
