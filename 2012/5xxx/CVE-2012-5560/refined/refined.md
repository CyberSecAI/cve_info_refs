{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mate-settings-daemon's datetime mechanism provides a D-Bus method to set the timezone, which was guarded by polkit's action org.mate.settingsdaemon.datetimemechanism.settimezone. The default policy was set to \"auth_self_keep\", allowing any local user to perform the operation knowing only their own password.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect authorization policy for setting the system timezone. The policy allowed any authenticated local user to change the timezone, which is considered a system-wide setting and should be restricted to administrators."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged user could change the system's timezone.",
  "Attack vectors": "Direct D-Bus calls to the `org.mate.SettingsDaemon.DateTimeMechanism.SetTimezone` method.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any local user with a valid password."
