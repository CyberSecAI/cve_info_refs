## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0220)

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Refer to the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 Release Notes for information
about the changes in this release. The Release Notes will be available
shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/>

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was found that the master cryptographic key of Jenkins could be
retrieved via the HTTP server that is hosting Jenkins. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to access the server and execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Jenkins. Note that this issue only
affected Jenkins instances that had slaves attached and that also allowed
anonymous read access (not the default configuration). Manual action is
also required to correct this issue. Refer to "Jenkins Security Advisory
2013-01-04", linked to in the References, for further information.
(CVE-2013-0158)

When the rhc-chk script was run in debug mode, its output included
sensitive information, such as database passwords, in plain text. As this
script is commonly used when troubleshooting, this flaw could lead to users
unintentionally exposing sensitive information in support channels (for
example, a Bugzilla report). This update removes the rhc-chk script.
(CVE-2012-5658)

Multiple flaws in the Jenkins web interface could allow a remote attacker
to perform HTTP response splitting and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks,
as well as redirecting a victim to an arbitrary page by utilizing an open
redirect flaw. (CVE-2012-6072, CVE-2012-6074, CVE-2012-6073)

A flaw was found in the way rubygem-activerecord dynamic finders extracted
options from method parameters. A remote attacker could possibly use this
flaw to perform SQL injection attacks against applications using the Active
Record dynamic finder methods. (CVE-2012-6496)

The openshift-port-proxy-cfg program created a temporary file in an
insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic
link attack, overwriting an arbitrary file accessible to the root user with
a "0" or a "1", which could lead to a denial of service. By default,
OpenShift uses polyinstantiation (per user) for the /tmp/ directory,
minimizing the risk of exploitation by local attackers. (CVE-2013-0164)

The CVE-2013-0164 issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat
Regional IT team.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.0 are advised to upgrade to Red Hat
OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.
