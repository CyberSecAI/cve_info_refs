Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the Monkey HTTP Daemon not properly checking if the specified pid-file is a symbolic link before writing to it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symlink Following (CWE-59 & CWE-61):** The vulnerability lies in the application's failure to verify if the pid-file is a symlink, leading to it following the symlink and potentially writing to an arbitrary file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to various impacts depending on which file is overwritten:
    - Denial of service by corrupting system configuration files.
    - Privilege escalation by overwriting files owned by higher privileged users.
    - Data corruption/manipulation by overwriting application or user data files.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the Monkey HTTP Daemon is running.
- **File System Access:** The attacker also requires write access to the directory containing the pid-file or the ability to influence the location of the pid-file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where Monkey HTTP Daemon is installed.
- **Write Access:** They need to have write access to the directory containing the pid-file or the ability to control where the pid-file is created. The user might not require to be root, as stated "in case user has user writable /var/run or in other way different environment".
- **Understanding of Symlink Attacks:** The attacker must be aware of symlink attacks and be able to set up a malicious symlink.

**Additional Notes:**

- The default pid-file location is `/var/run/monkey.pid`, but the vulnerability exists if a different path is used which is user-writable.
- The bug report notes that even if /var/run is not user-writable, there may be other environments where this vulnerability could be exploited.
- The package was ultimately removed from Debian due to multiple reasons, including this security issue, being outdated and unmaintained.
