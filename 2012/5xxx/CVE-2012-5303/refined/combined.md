Subject: monkey: CWE-61 symlink following
Date: Fri, 11 May 2012 02:14:43 +0300
```
Package: monkey
Version: 0.9.3-1
Severity: minor

Monkey does not properly check if pid-file (default: /var/run/monkey.pid) is a symlink file. This can permit an attacker to read/write/corrupt a file that they originally did not have permissions to access in case user has user writable /var/run or in other way different environment (mine is only writable by root and thus no security-tag). I would still like to see this fixed to avoid possible problems.

Package: ftp.debian.org
Severity: normal

Please remove monkey from the archive:
- No upload after 2009
- Version in Debian is quite outdated compared to upstream
- Plenty of alternatives in the archive
- Apparently broken on amd64 (688009)
- Security issues (672425, 688007, 688008)

Cheers,
        Moritz

Date: Sun, 30 Sep 2012 13:11:34 +0000
```
We believe that the bug you reported is now fixed; the following
package(s) have been removed from unstable:

    monkey |    0.9.3-1 | source, amd64, armel, armhf, i386, ia64, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, s390x, sparc
    monkey | 0.9.3-1+b1 | hurd-i386

------------------- Reason -------------------
RoQA; unmaintained, RC buggy, outdated, alternatives exist
----------------------------------------------

Note that the package(s) have simply been removed from the tag
database and may (or may not) still be in the pool; this is not a bug.
The package(s) will be physically removed automatically when no suite
references them (and in the case of source, when no binary references
it).  Please also remember that the changes have been done on the
master archive and will not propagate to any mirrors (ftp.debian.org
included) until the next dinstall run at the earliest.

Packages are usually not removed from testing by hand. Testing tracks
unstable and will automatically remove packages which were removed
from unstable when removing them from testing causes no dependency
problems. The release team can force a removal from testing if it is
really needed, please contact them if this should be the case.

We try to close bugs which have been reported against this package
automatically. But please check all old bugs, if they were closed
correctly or should have been re-assigned to another package.

Thank you for reporting the bug, which will now be closed.  If you
have further comments please address them to 688879@bugs.debian.org.

The full log for this bug can be viewed at <http://bugs.debian.org/688879>

This message was generated automatically; if you believe that there is
a problem with it please contact the archive administrators by mailing
