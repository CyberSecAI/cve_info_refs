Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5501:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `at_download.py` script within the Plone content management system. The specific weakness is related to insufficient access control checks when handling downloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function** - This indicates that the `at_download.py` script allows access to download functionality without proper authentication checks or authorization controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to download files within the Plone system without having the necessary permissions.
- This could lead to exposure of sensitive information, depending on the content stored within the system, and may also provide further attack vectors.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker would likely need to craft a specific request targeting the `at_download.py` script to bypass the access controls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have network access to the Plone instance.
- The attacker may not need to be authenticated, depending on the specific flaw in access control implementation within `at_download.py`.
