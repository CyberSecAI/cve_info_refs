{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of most of these vulnerabilities is the terrible design of the APIs to the underlying SSL libraries. Instead of expressing high-level security properties of network tunnels such as confidentiality and authentication, these APIs expose low-level details of the SSL protocol to application developers. As a consequence, developers often use SSL APIs incorrectly, misinterpreting and misunderstanding their manifold parameters, options, side effects, and return values.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Misunderstanding of SSL library APIs and their parameters",
    "Incorrect implementation of hostname verification",
    "Failure to check the results of certificate validation correctly",
    "Accidental or deliberate disabling of certificate validation",
    "Use of insecure SSL libraries that do not validate certificates",
		"Incorrect regular expressions for hostname matching",
		"Misunderstanding of security guarantees provided by SSL libraries"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "SSL connections established by vulnerable programs are insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack, allowing an attacker to intercept and decrypt sensitive data, including login credentials, payment details, and other personal information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts network traffic and presents a malicious server certificate to the client.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, such as controlling network routers, switches, Wi-Fi access points, or DNS."
