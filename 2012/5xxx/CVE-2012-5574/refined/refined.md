Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an information disclosure flaw in the way Symfony, a PHP web framework, sanitized HTTP POST request values. Specifically, it failed to properly validate uploaded file data within form submissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate sanitization of HTTP POST data, particularly file upload data.
- Lack of proper validation to prevent crafted file upload data.
- Allows for potential bypass of access controls via crafted requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized read access to arbitrary system files that are accessible by the web server process. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information including configuration files, source code or other critical data.
- Potential Information Disclosure: This can leak sensitive information, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the server.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is conducted by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request.
- **File Upload Field:** The attack targets web forms with file upload fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker must understand how to craft HTTP POST requests, and specifically how to manipulate file upload fields.
- **No Authentication Needed:** There is no evidence that authentication is needed, meaning the attack can be launched anonymously if the vulnerable form is publicly accessible.

**Additional Information from the Sources:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the php-symfony-symfony package, as shipped with Fedora releases 16 and 17, as well as Fedora EPEL 6.
- A fix is available in Symfony version 1.4.20, and patches were also provided.
- The issue was addressed in Gentoo via an updated ebuild (dev-php/symfony-1.4.20).
- The fix involves adding a check (`checkTaintedValues` method in `sfForm.class.php`) that throws an `InvalidArgumentException` if a POST value contains something that looks like a file upload (a `tmp_name` key in the array).
- Red Hat assigned CVE-2012-5574 to this issue.
- There are some reports of swiftmailer causing issues in the upgrade from older versions.

In summary, CVE-2012-5574 describes a vulnerability in Symfony where improper handling of HTTP POST data, particularly relating to file uploads, allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files on the server. This was addressed in version 1.4.20 of the framework.
