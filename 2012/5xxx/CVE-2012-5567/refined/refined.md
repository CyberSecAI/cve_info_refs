Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5567:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content directly relates to CVE-2012-5567, specifically mentioning it in the context of an XSS vulnerability in Kronolith.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of event location parameters within the Kronolith calendar application. Specifically, the `month`, `monthlist`, and `prevmonthlist` fields were vulnerable.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the presence of XSS vulnerabilities. This means that user-supplied input was not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary HTML/Webscript execution:** A successful exploit could lead to the execution of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could result in various malicious activities, including:
     - **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access to the user's account.
     - **Phishing attacks:** Displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content to steal credentials.
     - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or initiating downloads of malware.
     - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the affected web page.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **Malicious URL:** An attacker could craft a specially crafted URL containing malicious scripts within the event location parameters. When a user visits this URL, the injected script would be executed.
   - The vulnerability exists within the portal blocks of the application.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it. This could be achieved by various means such as social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing emails), or by embedding the malicious URL on a compromised website.
   - No special privileges or access to the server itself are needed. The vulnerability is exploited client-side, through the victim's browser.
