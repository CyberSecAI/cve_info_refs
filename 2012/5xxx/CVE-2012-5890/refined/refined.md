Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2012-5890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Front End User Registration" (sr\_feuser\_register) TYPO3 extension. Specifically, it was found that:
  - When editing user information, the password of frontend users was being transmitted in plaintext.
  - The autologin feature used a GET redirect which exposed username and password in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Plaintext storage and transmission of user passwords.
- **Insecure Autologin:**  Credentials exposed via GET request parameters in autologin functionality

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to user credentials, as passwords are not stored securely or transmitted using encryption
- **Account Compromise:** Exploiting this vulnerability could allow malicious actors to compromise user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** Monitoring network traffic to capture the plaintext password during edit operations.
- **Autologin URL capture:** Intercepting the GET request containing credentials during autologin.
- **Browser history or logs:** Accessing the autologin URL from a user's browser history or server logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** To intercept HTTP traffic or access server logs.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable TYPO3 instance:** To know that the specific extension is in use
- **Ability to trigger editing:** To view plaintext password or trigger auto-login
