Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-5391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is that MediaWiki core does not refresh session IDs upon user login or logout. This makes the application vulnerable to session fixation attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The core weakness is the lack of session ID regeneration. A session ID should be renewed whenever a user's privilege level changes (e.g., logging in or logging out).
- **Lack of Session ID Refresh on Privilege Change:** The application fails to generate a new session ID when a user logs in or logs out, thus preserving the original session ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially gain control of another user's account.
- **Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate a legitimate user by using a fixed or known session ID.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the session cookie of a victim before the user logs in using techniques like XSS, .jar uploads, or header splitting on a MediaWiki domain.
- **Shared Machine Attacks:** Attackers can set a known session cookie on a shared computer in a class or cafe environment before the victim logs in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Set Session Cookie:** The attacker needs the ability to set a specific cookie value (`enwiki_session`) on the victim's browser, either through vulnerabilities, or by having access to the user's device.
- **Knowledge of Fixed Session ID:** The attacker has to know the session ID to be used for the attack, which can be set by the attacker or obtained prior.
- **Victim Login:** The victim needs to subsequently log in to the target MediaWiki site after the attacker has set the session cookie.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified during an internal review of MediaWiki.
- A patch was developed that updates the `SpecialUserlogin` to refresh the user's session ID on each login.
- The fix was deployed to the cluster on November 15, 2012.
-  The vulnerability is considered a method for turning a non-persistent vulnerability like XSS into a persistent one by using the ability to set a known session ID.
