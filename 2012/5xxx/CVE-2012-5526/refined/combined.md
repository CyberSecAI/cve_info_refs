Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the implementation of the Perl
programming language:

CVE-2012-5195
	The "x" operator could cause the Perl interpreter to crash
	if very long strings were created.

CVE-2012-5526
	The CGI module does not properly escape LF characters
	in the Set-Cookie and P3P headers.

In addition, this update adds a warning to the Storable documentation
that this package is not suitable for deserializing untrusted data.

## Details

It was discovered that the decode\_xs function in the Encode module is

vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted Unicode string.

An attacker could use this overflow to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2011-2939](/security/CVE-2011-2939))

It was discovered that the 'new' constructor in the Digest module is

vulnerable to an eval injection. An attacker could use this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3597](/security/CVE-2011-3597))

It was discovered that Perl's 'x' string repeat operator is vulnerable

to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-5195](/security/CVE-2012-5195))

Ryo Anazawa discovered that the CGI.pm module does not properly escape

newlines in Set-Cookie or P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences Project)

headers. An attacker could use this to inject arbitrary headers into

responses from applications that use CGI.pm. ([CVE-2012-5526](/security/CVE-2012-5526))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle VM Server for x86 Security Advisories (OVMSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad](//linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=877015#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-15 14:37:53 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way CGI.pm, a Perl module to handle Common Gateway Interface requests and responses, performed sanitization of values to be used for Set-Cookie and P3P headers. If a Perl CGI.pm module based CGI application reused cookies values and accepted untrusted input from web browser(s), a remote attacker could use this flaw to in an unauthorized way alter member items of the cookie or add new items.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0685)

## Topic

Updated perl packages that fix multiple security issues now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for
each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
administration utilities and web programming.

A heap overflow flaw was found in Perl. If a Perl application allowed
user input to control the count argument of the string repeat operator, an
attacker could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
(CVE-2012-5195)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Perl's rehashing code
implementation, responsible for recalculation of hash keys and
redistribution of hash content, handled certain input. If an attacker
supplied specially-crafted input to be used as hash keys by a Perl
application, it could cause excessive memory consumption. (CVE-2013-1667)

It was found that the Perl CGI module, used to handle Common Gateway
Interface requests and responses, incorrectly sanitized the values for
Set-Cookie and P3P headers. If a Perl application using the CGI module
reused cookies values and accepted untrusted input from web browsers, a
remote attacker could use this flaw to alter member items of the cookie or
add new items. (CVE-2012-5526)

It was found that the Perl Locale::Maketext module, used to localize Perl
applications, did not properly handle backslashes or fully-qualified method
names. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary Perl
code with the privileges of a Perl application that uses untrusted
Locale::Maketext templates. (CVE-2012-6329)

Red Hat would like to thank the Perl project for reporting CVE-2012-5195
and CVE-2013-1667. Upstream acknowledges Tim Brown as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-5195 and Yves Orton as the original reporter of
CVE-2013-1667.

All Perl users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. All running Perl programs
must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the Red
Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-12-06 03:28:11 UTC  ``` A commit to the upstream perl git repository [1] indicated that perl's Locale::Maketext was vulnerable to a flaw that could lead to arbitrary code execution of this function was executed on user-supplied input.  Quoting the commit message:  Case 61251: This commit fixes a misparse of maketext strings that could lead to arbitrary code execution.  Basically, maketext was compiling bracket notation into functions, but neglected to escape backslashes inside the content or die on fully-qualified method names when generating the code.  This change escapes all such backslashes and dies when a method name with a colon or apostrophe is specified.  [1] <http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/1735f6f53ca19f99c6e9e39496c486af323ba6a8>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-12-06 04:05:18 UTC  ``` In perl 5.8.8 and 5.10.1, this affected code is in lib/Locale/Maketext/Guts.pm, not lib/Locale/Maketext.pm (as implied in the git commit above).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-12-06 04:06:30 UTC  ``` Created perl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 884363](show_bug.cgi?id=884363 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - perl: possible arbitrary code execution via Locale::Maketext [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c3)  Petr Pisar    2012-12-06 15:08:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 658787](attachment.cgi?id=658787 "Template for reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=658787&action=edit "Template for reproducer") Template for reproducer  Could show the attack vector? Attached is small code showing how to use Locale::Maketext. Please modify it to explain the vulnerability.  I think the vulnerability is effective only when attacker has first argument of maketext() under control.  However that means the attacker can run any code even without this `vulnerability'. It's like saying glibc's gettext() is vulnerable. But that's not true.  Sure gettext("%s", user_input) is not safe, but this is flaw in the caller, not in the gettext. The same applies to Locale::Maketext::maketext().   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c4)  Petr Pisar    2012-12-06 16:18:46 UTC  ``` And actually the patch breaks behaviour because it forbids cross-package calls which were explicitly allowed and documented before. I disbelieve the patch is good candidate for stable distributions.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-04 21:59:53 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2012-6329](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6329) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2012-6329](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6329) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6329> Assigned: 20121210 Reference: <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=30219695> Reference: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/12/11/4> Reference: <http://code.activestate.com/lists/perl5-porters/187763/> Reference: <http://code.activestate.com/lists/perl5-porters/187746/> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=884354](show_bug.cgi?id=884354 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-6329 perl: possible arbitrary code execution via Locale::Maketext") Reference: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=695224> Reference: [http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/pod/perl5177delta.pod](http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD%3A/pod/perl5177delta.pod) Reference: <http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/1735f6f53ca19f99c6e9e39496c486af323ba6a8> Reference: <http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecurityAlert-CVE-2012-6329>  The _compile function in Maketext.pm in the Locale::Maketext implementation in Perl before 5.17.7 does not properly handle backslashes and fully qualified method names during compilation of bracket notation, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted input to an application that accepts translation strings from users, as demonstrated by the TWiki application before 5.1.3, and the Foswiki application 1.0.x through 1.0.10 and 1.1.x through 1.1.6.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c7)  Petr Pisar    2013-01-11 10:34:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 676781](attachment.cgi?id=676781&action=diff "Upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=676781&action=edit "Upstream fix") Upstream fix   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=884354#c8)  Fedora Update System    2013-01-24 21:54:45 UTC  ``` perl-5.14.3-205.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

/ Changes

```
Version 3.63 Nov 12, 2012

    [SECURITY]
    - CR escaping for Set-Cookie and P3P headers was improved. There was potential
      for newline injection in these headers.
      (Thanks to anazawa, https://github.com/markstos/CGI.pm/pull/23)

Version 3.62, Nov 9th, 2012

    [INTERNALS]
    - Changed how the  deprecated endform function was defined for compatibilty
      with the development version of Perl.
    - Fix failures in t/tmpdir.t when run as root
      https://github.com/markstos/CGI.pm/issues/22, RT#80659)

    - Made it possible to force a sorted order for things like hash
      attributes so that tests are not dependent on a particular hash
      ordering. This will be required in modern perls which will
      change the ordering per process. (Yves, RT#80659)

Version 3.61 Nov 2nd, 2012

  (No code changes)

  [INTERNALS]
   - formatting of CGI::Carp documentation was improved. Thanks to benkasminbullock.
   - un-TODO some tests in t/tmpdir.t that were passing in most cases.
     More on this:
       https://github.com/markstos/CGI.pm/issues/19#
       https://github.com/markstos/CGI.pm/commit/cc73dc9807b0fabb56b3cdf1a9726588b2eda0f7

Version 3.60 Aug 15th, 2012

  [BUG FIXES]
  - In some caes, When unescapeHTML() hit something it didn't recognize with an ampersand and
    and semicolon, it would throw away the semicolon and ampersand. It now does a better job.
    of preserving content it doesn't recognize. Thanks to CEBJYRE@cpan.org (RT#75595)
  - Remove trailing newline after <form> tag inserted by startform and start_form. It can
    cause rendering problems in some cases. Thanks to SJOHNSTON@cpan.org (RT#67719)
  - Workaround "Insecure Dependency" warning generated by some versions of Perl (RT#53733).
    Thanks to degatcpan@ntlworld.com, klchu@lbl.gov and Anonymous Monk

  [DOCUMENTATION]
  - Clarify that when -status is used, the human-readable phase should be included, per RFC 2616.
    Thanks to SREZIC@cpan.org (RT#76691).

  [INTERNALS]
  - More tests for header(), thanks to Ryo Anazawa.
  - t/url.t has been fixed on VMS. Thanks to cberry@cpan.org (RT#72380)
  - MANIFEST patched so that t/multipart_init.t is included again. Thanks to shay@cpan.org (RT#76189)

Version 3.59 Dec 29th, 2011

 [BUG FIXES]
 - We no longer read from STDIN when the Content-Length is not set, preventing
   requests with no Content-Length from freezing in some cases. This is consistent
   with the CGI RFC 3875, and is also consistent with CGI::Simple. However, the old
   behavior may have been expected by some command-line uses of CGI.pm.
   Thanks to Philip Potter and Yanick Champoux. See RT#52469 for details:
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=52469

 [INTERNALS]
 - remove tmpdirs more aggressively. Thanks to rjbs (RT#73288)
 - use Text::ParseWords instead of ancient shellwords.pl. Thanks to AlexBio.
 - remove use of define(@arr). Thanks to rjbs.
 - spelling fixes. Thanks to Gregor Herrmann and Alessandro Ghedini.
 - fix test count and warning in t/fast.t. Thanks to Yanick.

Version 3.58 Nov 11th, 2011

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - Clarify that using query_string() only has defined behavior when using the GET method. (RT#60813)

Version 3.57 Nov 9th, 2011
    [INTERNALS]
    - test failure in t/fast.t introduced in 3.56 is fixed. (Thanks to zefram and chansen).
    - Test::More requirement has been bumped to 0.98

Version 3.56 Nov 8th, 2011

    [SECURITY]
    Use public and documented FCGI.pm API in CGI::Fast
        CGI::Fast was using an FCGI API that was deprecated and removed from
        documentation more than ten years ago. Usage of this deprecated API with
        FCGI >= 0.70 or FCGI <= 0.73 introduces a security issue.
        <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68380>
        <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2766>
        (Thanks to chansen)

    [INTERNALS]
    - tmp files are now cleaned up on VMS ( RT#69210, thanks to cberry@cpan.org )
    - Fixed test failure: done_testing() added to url.t (Thanks to Ryan Jendoubi)
    - Clarify preferred bug submission location in docs, and note that Mark Stosberg
      is the current maintainer.

Version 3.55 June 3rd, 2011

    [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
    url() was fixed to return "PATH_INFO" when it is explicitly requested
    with either the path=>1 or path_info=>1 flag.

    If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you are calling self_url() or
    you are calling url() and passing path_info=>1, These methods will actually be
    returning PATH_INFO now, as you have explicitly requested, or has self_url()
    has requested on your behalf.

    The PATH_INFO has been omitted in such URLs since the issue was introduced
    in the 3.12 release in December, 2005.

    This bug is so old your application may have come to depend on it or
    workaround it. Check for application before upgrading to this release.

    Examples of affected method calls:

     $q->url(-absolute => 1, -query => 1, -path_info => 1 )
     $q->url(-path=>1)
     $q->url(-full=>1,-path=>1)
     $q->url(-rewrite=>1,-path=>1)
     $q->self_url();

Version 3.54, Apr 28, 2011
   No code changes

   [INTERNALS]
   - Address test failures in t/tmpdir.t, thanks to Niko Tyni.
     Some tests here are failing on some platforms and have been marked as TODO.

Version 3.53, Apr 25, 2011

  [NEW FEATURES]
  - The DELETE HTTP verb is now supported.
    (RT#52614, James Robson, Eduardo Ari�o de la Rubia)

  [INTERNALS]
  - Correct t/tmpdir.t MANIFEST entry. (RT#64949)
  - Update minimum required Perl version to be Perl 5.8.1, which
    has been out since 2003. This allows us to drop some hacks
    and exceptions (Mark Stosberg)

Version 3.52, Jan 24, 2011

  [DOCUMENTATION]
  - The documentation for multi-line header handling was been updated to reflect
    the changes in 3.51. (Mark Stosberg, ntyni@iki.fi)

  [INTERNALS]
  - Add missing t/tmpfile.t file. (RT#64949)
  - Fix warning in t/cookie.t (RT#64570, Chris Williams, Rainer Tammer, Mark Stosberg)
  - Fixed logic bug in t/multipart_init.t (RT#64261, Niko Tyni)

Version 3.51, Jan 5, 2011

  [NEW FEATURES]
  - A new option to set $CGI::Carp::TO_BROWSER = 0, allows you to explicitly
    exclude a particular scope from triggering printing to the browser when
    fatatlsToBrowser is set. (RT#62783, Thanks to papowell)
  - The <script> tag now supports the "charset" attribute.
    (RT#62907, Thanks to Fabrice Metge)
  - In CGI::Cookie, "Max-Age" is now supported for better spec compliance.
    (Mark Stosberg)

  [BUG FIXES]
  - Setting charset() now works for all content types, not just "text/*".
    (RT#57945, Thanks to Yanick and Gerv.)
  - support for user temporary directories ($HOME/tmp) was commented out
    in 2.61 but the documentation wasn't updated (Peter Gervai, Niko Tyni)
  - setting $CGITempFile::TMPDIRECTORY before loading CGI.pm has been
    working but undocumented since 3.12 (which listed it in Changes as
    $CGI::TMPDIRECTORY) (Peter Gervai, Niko Tyni)
  - unfortunately the previous change broke the runtime check for looking
    for a new temporary directory if the current one suddenly became
    unwritable (Peter Gervai, Niko Tyni)
  - A bug was fixed in CGI::Carp triggered by certain death cases in
    the BEGIN phase of parent classes.
    (RT#57224, Thanks to UNERA, Yanick Champoux, Mark Stosberg)
  - CGI::Cookie->new() now follows the documentation and returns undef
    if the -name and -value args aren't provided. This new behavior is also
    consistent with the docs and code of CGI::Simple::Cookie. (Mark Stosberg)
  - CGI::Cookie->parse() now trims leading and trailing whitespace from cookie
    elements as intended. The change also makes this part of the parsing
    identical to CGI::Simple::Cookie (Mark Stosberg)
  - Temp file handling was improved (RT#62762)

  [SECURITY]
  - Further improvements have been made to guard against newline injections
    in headers. (Thanks to Max Kanat-Alexander, Yanick Champoux, Mark Stosberg)

  [PERFORMANCE]
  - Make EBCDIC a compile-time constant so there's zero overhead (and less
    compiled code) in subroutines that test for it. (Tim Bunce)
  - If you just want to use CGI::Cookie, CGI.pm will no longer be loaded
    unless you call the bake() method, which requires it. (Mark Stosberg)

  [DOCUMENTATION]
  - quit referring to the <link> tag as being "rarely used".  (Victor Sanders)
  - typo and whitespace fixes (RT#62785, thanks to  scop@cpan.org)
  - The -dtd argument to start_html() is now documented
    (RT#60473, Thanks to giecrilj and steve@fisharerojo.org)
  - CGI::Carp doc are updated to reflect that it can work with mod_perl 2.0.
  - when creating a temporary file in the directory fails, the error message
    could indicate the root of the problem better (Peter Gervai, Niko Tyni)

  [INTERNALS]
  - Re-fixing https test in http.t. (RT#54768, thanks to SPROUT)
  - param_fetch no longer triggers a warning when called with no arguments (ysth, Mark Stosberg)

  3. Quashed uninitialized variable warnings coming from script_name(), url() and other
        functions that require access to the PATH_INFO environment variable.

Version 3.19

  1. Added patch from Stephen Frost that allows one to suppress use of the temp file that is
	created during uploads.
  2. Fixed problem noted by Martin Foster in which regular expression meta-character terms
	in the path information were not quoted, causing URL parsing

	turn automatic indexes back on.
    7. The url() and self_url() methods now work better in the context of Apache
       mod_rewrite. Be advised that path_info() may give you confusing results
       when mod_rewrite is active because Apache calculates the path info *after*
       rewriting. This is mostly worked around in url() and self_url(), but you
       may notice some anomalies.
    8. Removed empty (and non-validating) <div> from code emitted by end_form().
    9. Fixed CGI::Carp to work correctly with Mod_perl 1.29 in an Apache 2 environment.
   10. Setting $CGI::TMPDIRECTORY should now be effective.

    2. Fixed append() so that it works in function mode.
    3. Workaround for a bug that appears in Apache2 versions through 2.0.54
       in which SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO are incorrect if the additional path_info
       contains a double slash. This workaround will handle the common case of
       http://mysite.com/cgi-bin/log.cgi/http://www.some.other.site/args, but will
       not handle the uncommon case of a ScriptAlias directive that adds additional
       path information to the end of the translated URI.

Version 3.10, May 13, 2005

    1. Added Apache2::RequestIO, which is necessary for mp2 interoperability.

Version 3.06, Mar 09, 2005

    1. Fixed bare call to script() in start_html

       clobbering $@ when CGI functions are executed in an eval{}
       context.
    3. mod_perl 2.0 version detection patch in CGI::Cookie provided by
       Allen Day.

	and checkbox groups, as reported by Nicolas Thierry-Mieg.
   10. <Label> tags are now associated with form elements, as suggested
	by accessibility guidelines.
   11. The <?xml> directive produced by start_html is now turned off by
        default and the charset is specified in a <meta> directive.  Apparently
        IE6 (and maybe some versions of Opera) were getting confused by this.
   12. Support for tab indexes.
   13. Retired the HTML docs.  The POD docs are now primary documentation.
   14. CGI::Carp now correctly detects and handles Apache::Dispatch.
   15. CGI::Util::utf8_chr now correctly sets the UTF8 flag on 5.006 or
	higher perls (fix courtesy Slaven Rezic).

       from command line.

       correctly.
    3. Fixed CGI::Carp::die() so as to avoid problems from _longmess()
       clobbering @_.
    4. If HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST is defined (i.e. running under a proxy),
       the various functions that return HOST will use that instead.
    5. Fix for undefined utf8() call in CGI::Util.
    6. Changed the call to warningsToBrowser() in
       CGI::Carp::fatalsToBrowser to call only after HTTP header is sent
       (thanks to Didier Lebrun for noticing).
    7. Patches from Dan Harkless to make CGI.pm validatable against HTML
       3.2.
    8. Fixed an extraneous "foo=bar" appearing when extra style
       parameters passed to start_html;

   12. Fixed query string stripping in order to handle URLs containing
       escaped newlines.
   13. During server push, set NPH to 0 rather than 1. This is supposed
       to fix problems with Apache.
   14. Fixed incorrect processing of multipart form fields that contain
       embedded quotes. There's still the issue of how to handle ones
       that contain embedded semicolons, but no one has complained (yet).

    2. Squashed the "useless use of string in void context" message from
       redirects.

  Version 2.69

    1. startform() now creates default ACTION for POSTs as well as GETs.
       This may break some browsers, but it no longer violates the HTML
       spec.
    2. CGI.pm now emits XHTML by default. Disable with -no_xhtml.
    3. We no longer interpret &#ddd sequences in non-latin character
       sets.

  Version 2.68

    1. No longer attempts to escape characters when dealing with non
       ISO-8861 character sets.
    2. checkbox() function now defaults to using -value as its label,
       rather than -name. The current behavior is what has been
       documented from the beginning.
    3. -style accepts array reference to incorporate multiple stylesheets
       into document.

    1. Fixed two bugs that caused the -compile pragma to fail with a
       syntax error.

  Version 2.67

    1. Added XHTML support (incomplete; tags need to be lowercased).
    2. Fixed CGI/Carp when running under mod_perl. Probably broke in
       other contexts.
    3. Fixed problems when passing multiple cookies.
    4. Suppress warnings from _tableize() that were appearing when using
       -w switch with radio_group() and checkbox_group().
    5. Support for the header() -attachment argument, which can give
       pages a default file name when saving to disk.

  Version 2.66

    1. 2.65 changes in make_attributes() broke HTTP header functions
       (including redirect), so made it context sensitive.

  Version 2.65

    1. Fixed regression tests to skip tests that require implicit fork on
       machines without fork().
    2. Changed make_attributes() to automatically escape any HTML
       reserved characters.
    3. Minor documentation fix in javascript example.

  Version 2.64

    1. Changes introduced in 2.63 broke param() when retrieving parameter
       lists containing only a single argument. This is now fixed.
    2. self_url() now defaults to returning parameters delimited with
       semicolon. Use the pragma -oldstyle_urls to get the old "&"
       delimiter.

  Version 2.63

    1. Fixed CGI::Push to pull out parameters correctly.
    2. Fixed redirect() so that it works with default character set
    3. Changed param() so as to returned empty string '' when referring
       to variables passed in query strings like 'name1=&name2'

  Version 2.62

    1. Fixed broken ReadParse() function, and added regression tests
    2. Fixed broken CGI::Pretty, and added regression tests

  Version 2.61

    1. Moved more functions from CGI.pm proper into CGI/Util.pm.
       CGI/Cookie should now be standalone.
    2. Disabled per-user temporary directories, which were causing grief.

  Version 2.60

    1. Fixed junk appearing in autogenerated HTML functions when using
       object-oriented mode.

  Version 2.59

    1. autoescape functionality breaks too much existing code, removed
       it.
    2. use escapeHTML() manually

  Version 2.58

   This is the release version of 2.57.

  Version 2.57

    1. Added -debug pragma and turned off auto reading of STDIN.
    2. Default DTD updated to HTML 4.01 transitional.
    3. Added charset() method and the -charset argument to header().
    4. Fixed behavior of escapeHTML() to respect charset() and to escape
       nasty Windows characters (thanks to Tom Christiansen).
    5. Handle REDIRECT_QUERY_STRING correctly.
    6. Removed use_named_parameters() because of dependency problems and
       general lameness.
    7. Fixed problems with bad HREF links generated by url(-relative=>1)
       when the url is like /people/.
    8. Silenced a warning on upload (patch provided by Jonas Liljegren)
    9. Fixed race condition in CGI::Carp when errors occur during parsing
       (patch provided by Maurice Aubrey).
   10. Fixed failure of url(-path_info=>1) when path contains % signs.
   11. Fixed warning from CGI::Cookie when receiving foreign cookies that
       don't use name=value format.
   12. Fixed incompatibilities with file uploading on VMS systems.

  Version 2.56

    1. Fixed bugs in file upload introduced in version 2.55
    2. Fixed long-standing bug that prevented two files with identical
       names from being uploaded.

  Version 2.55

    1. Fixed cookie regression test so as not to produce an error.
    2. Fixed path_info() and self_url() to work correctly together when
       path_info() modified.
    3. Removed manify warnings from CGI::{Switch,Apache}.

  Version 2.54

    1. This will be the last release of the monolithic CGI.pm module.
       Later versions will be modularized and optimized.
    2. DOMAIN tag no longer added to cookies by default. This will break
       some versions of Internet Explorer, but will avoid breaking
       networks which use host tables without fully qualified domain
       names. For compatibility, please always add the -domain tag when
       creating cookies.
    3. Fixed escape() method so that +'s are treated correctly.
    4. Updated CGI::Pretty module.

  Version 2.53

    1. Forgot to upgrade regression tests before releasing 2.52. NOTHING
       ELSE HAS CHANGED IN LIBRARY

  Version 2.52

    1. Spurious newline in checkbox() routine removed. (courtesy John
       Essen)
    2. TEXTAREA linebreaks now respected in dump() routine. (courtesy
       John Essen)
    3. Patches for DOS ports (courtesy Robert Davies)
    4. Patches for VMS
    5. More fixes for cookie problems
    6. Fix CGI::Carp so that it doesn't affect eval{} blocks (courtesy
       Byron Brummer)

  Version 2.51

    1. Fixed problems with cookies not being remembered when sent to IE
       5.0 (and Netscape 5.0 too?)
    2. Numerous HTML compliance problems in cgi_docs.html; fixed thanks
       to Michael Leahy

  Version 2.50

    1. Added a new Vars() method to retrieve all parameters as a tied
       hash.
    2. Untainted tainted tempfile name so that script doesn't fail on
       terminal unlink.
    3. Made picking of upload tempfile name more intelligent so that
       doesn't fail in case of name collision.
    4. Fixed handling of expire times when passed an absolute timestamp.
    5. Changed dump() to Dump() to avoid name clashes.

  Version 2.49

    1. Fixes for FastCGI (globals not getting reset)
    2. Fixed url() to correctly handle query string and path under
       MOD_PERL

  Version 2.48

    1. Reverted detection of MOD_PERL to avoid breaking PerlEX.

  Version 2.47

    1. Patch to fix file upload bug appearing in IE 3.01 for
       Macintosh/PowerPC.
    2. Replaced use of $ENV{SCRIPT_NAME} with $ENV{REQUEST_URI} when
       running under Apache, to fix self-referencing URIs.
    3. Fixed bug in escapeHTML() which caused certain constructs, such as
       CGI->image_button(), to fail.
    4. Fixed bug which caused strong('CGI') to fail. Be careful to use
       CGI::strong('CGI') and not CGI->strong('CGI'). The latter will
       produce confusing results.
    5. Added upload() function, as a preferred replacement for the
       "filehandle as string" feature.
    6. Added cgi_error() function.
    7. Rewrote file upload handling to return undef rather than dieing
       when an error is encountered. Be sure to call cgi_error() to find
       out what went wrong.

  Version 2.46

    1. Fix for failure of the "include" tests under mod_perl
    2. Added end_multipart_form to prevent failures during qw(-compile
       :all)

  Version 2.45

    1. Multiple small documentation fixes
    2. CGI::Pretty didn't get into 2.44. Fixed now.

  Version 2.44

    1. Fixed file descriptor leak in upload function.
    2. Fixed bug in header() that prevented fields from containing double
       quotes.
    3. Added Brian Paulsen's CGI::Pretty package for pretty-printing
       output HTML.
    4. Removed CGI::Apache and CGI::Switch from the distribution.
    5. Generated start_* shortcuts so that start_table(), end_table(),
       start_ol(), end_ol(), and so forth now work (see the docs on how
       to enable this feature).
    6. Changed accept() to Accept(), sub() to Sub(). There's still a
       conflict with reset(), but this will break too many existing
       scripts!

  Version 2.43

    1. Fixed problem with "use strict" and file uploads (thanks to Peter
       Haworth)
    2. Fixed problem with not MSIE 3.01 for the power_mac not doing file
       uploads right.
    3. Fixed problem with file upload on IIS 4.0 when authorization in
       use.
    4. -content_type and '-content-type' can now be provided to header()
       as synonyms for -type.
    5. CGI::Carp now escapes the ampersand BEFORE escaping the > and <
       signs.
    6. Fixed "not an array reference" error when passing a hash reference
       to radio_group().
    7. Fixed non-removal of uploaded TMP files on NT platforms which
       occurs when server runs on non-C drive (thanks to Steve Kilbane
       for finding this one).

  Version 2.42

    1. Too many screams of anguish at changed behavior of url(). Is now
       back to its old behavior by default, with options to generate all
       the variants.
    2. Added regression tests. "make test" now works.
    3. Documentation fixes.
    4. Fixes for Macintosh uploads, but uploads STILL do not work pending
       changes to MacPerl.

  Version 2.41

    1. url() method now includes the path info. Use script_name() to get
       it without path info().
    2. Changed handling of empty attributes in HTML tag generation. Be
       warned! Use table({-border=>undef}) rather than
       table({-border=>''}).
    3. Changes to allow uploaded filenames to be compared to other
       strings with "eq", "cmp" and "ne".
    4. Changes to allow CGI.pm to coexist more peacefully with
       ActiveState PerlEX.
    5. Changes to prevent exported variables from clashing when importing
       ":all" set in combination with cookies.

  Version 2.40

    1. CGI::Carp patched to work better with mod_perl (thanks to Chris
       Dean).
    2. Uploads of files whose names begin with numbers or the Windows
       \\UNC\shared\file nomenclature should no longer fail.
    3. The <STYLE> tag (for cascading style sheets) now generates the
       required TYPE attribute.
    4. Server push primitives added, thanks to Ed Jordan.
    5. Table and other HTML3 functions are now part of the :standard set.
    6. Small documentation fixes.

   TO DO:
    1. Do something about the DTD mess. The module should generate
       correct DTDs, or at least offer the programmer a way to specify
       the correct one.
    2. Split CGI.pm into CGI processing and HTML-generating modules.
    3. More robust file upload (?still not working on the Macintosh?).
    4. Bring in all the HTML4 functionality, particular the accessibility
       features.

  Version 2.39

    1. file uploads failing because of VMS patch; fixed.
    2. -dtd parameter was not being properly processed.

  Version 2.38

   I finally got tired of all the 2.37 betas and released 2.38. The main
   difference between this version and the last 2.37 beta (2.37b30) are
   some fixes for VMS. This should allow file upload to work properly on
   all VMS Web servers.

  Version 2.37, various beta versions

       importing.
    7. Documented the import pragmas a little better.
    8. Added a -compile switch to the use clause for the long-suffering
       mod_perl and Perl compiler users.
    9. Fixed initialization routines so that FileHandle and type globs
       work correctly (and hash initialization doesn't fail!).
   10. Better deletion of temporary files on NT systems.
   11. Added documentation on escape(), unescape(), unescapeHTML() and
       unescapeHTML() subroutines.
   12. Added documentation on creating subclasses.
   13. Fixed problem when calling $self->SUPER::foo() from inheriting
       subclasses.
   14. Fixed problem using filehandles from within subroutines.
   15. Fixed inability to use the string "CGI" as a parameter.
   16. Fixed exponentially growing $FILLUNIT bug

   20. Fixed vanishing cookie problem.
   21. Fixed warning in initialize_globals() under mod_perl.
   22. File uploads from Macintosh versions of MSIE should now work.
   23. Pragmas now preceded by dashes (-nph) rather than colons (:nph).
       Old style is supported for backward compatibility.
   24. Can now pass arguments to all functions using {} brackets,
       resolving historical inconsistencies.
   25. Removed autoloader warnings about absent MultipartBuffer::DESTROY.
   26. Fixed non-sticky checkbox() when -name used without -value.
   27. Hack to fix path_info() in IIS 2.0. Doesn't help with IIS 3.0.
   28. Parameter syntax for debugging from command line now more
       straightforward.
   29. Added $DISABLE_UPLOAD to disable file uploads.
   30. Added $POST_MAX to error out if POSTings exceed some ceiling.
   31. Fixed url_param(), which wasn't working at all.
   32. Fixed variable suicide problem in s///e expressions, where the
       autoloader was needed during evaluation.
   33. Removed excess spaces between elements of checkbox and radio
       groups
   34. Can now create "valueless" submit buttons
   35. Can now set path_info as well as read it.
   36. ReadParse() now returns a useful function result.
   37. import_names() now allows you to optionally clear out the
       namespace before importing (for mod_perl users)
   38. Made it possible to have a popup menu or radio button with a value
       of "0".
   39. link() changed to Link() to avoid overriding native link function.
   40. Takes advantage of mod_perl's register_cleanup() function to clear
       globals.
   41. <LAYER> and <ILAYER> added to :html3 functions.
   42. Fixed problems with private tempfiles and NT/IIS systems.
   43. No longer prints the DTD by default (I bet no one will complain).
   44. Allow underscores to replace internal hyphens in parameter names.
   45. CGI::Push supports heterogeneous MIME types and adjustable delays
       between pages.
   46. url_param() method added for retrieving URL parameters even when a
       fill-out form is POSTed.
   47. Got rid of warnings when radio_group() is called.
   48. Cookies now moved to their very own module.
   49. Fixed documentation bug in CGI::Fast.
   50. Added a :no_debug pragma to the import list.

  Version 2.36

    1. Expanded JavaScript functionality
    2. Preliminary support for cascading stylesheets
    3. Security fixes for file uploads:
          + Module will bail out if its temporary file already exists
          + Temporary files can now be made completely private to avoid
            peeking by other users or CGI scripts.
    4. use CGI qw/:nph/ wasn't working correctly. Now it is.
    5. Cookie and HTTP date formats didn't meet spec. Thanks to Mark
       Fisher (fisherm@indy.tce.com) for catching and fixing this.

       switch.
    4. Removed operator overloading throughout to make compatible with
       new versions of perl.
    5. -expires now implies the -date header, to avoid clock skew.
    6. WebSite passes cookies in $ENV{COOKIE} rather than
       $ENV{HTTP_COOKIE}. We now handle this, even though it's O'Reilly's
       fault.
    7. Tested successfully against new sfio I/O layer.
    8. Documentation fixes.

  Version 2.30

    1. Automatic detection of operating system at load time.
    2. Changed select() function to Select() in order to avoid conflict
       with Perl built-in.
    3. Added Tr() as an alternative to TR(); some people think it looks
       better that way.
    4. Fixed problem with autoloading of MultipartBuffer::DESTROY code.
    5. Added the following methods:

       IIS.
    2. Fixed a problem with checkbox() values not being correctly saved
       and restored.

       attributes was accidentally capitalizing the VALUES as well as the
       ATTRIBUTE names (oops).

  Version 2.26

    1. Changed behavior of scrolling_list(), checkbox() and
       checkbox_group() methods so that defaults are honored correctly.

  Version 2.24

    1. Fixed bug that caused generation of lousy HTML for some form
       elements
    2. Fixed uploading bug in Windows NT
    3. Some code cleanup (not enough)

  Version 2.23

    1. Fixed an obscure bug that caused scripts to fail mysteriously.
    2. Fixed auto-caching bug.
    3. Fixed bug that prevented HTML shortcuts from passing taint checks.
    4. Fixed some -w warning problems.

  Version 2.22

    1. New CGI::Fast module for use with FastCGI protocol. See pod
       documentation for details.
    2. Fixed problems with inheritance and autoloading.
    3. Added TR() (<tr>) and PARAM() (<param>) methods to list of
       exported HTML tag-generating functions.

       longer generate a default one. May speed things up slightly.
   10. Aesthetic improvements in generated HTML.
   11. New examples.

  Version 2.21

    1. Added the -meta argument to start_html().
    2. Fixed hidden fields (again).
    3. Radio_group() and checkbox_group() now return an appropriate
       scalar value when called in a scalar context, rather than
       returning a numeric value!
    4. Cleaned up the formatting of form elements to avoid unesthetic
       extra spaces within the attributes.
    5. HTML elements now correctly include the closing tag when
       parameters are present but null: em('')
    6. Added password_field() to the export list.

    5. Fixed a dumb bug in JavaScript button() method.

  Version 2.18

    1. Fixed a bug that corrects a hang that occurs on some platforms
       when processing file uploads. Unfortunately this disables the
       check for bad Netscape uploads.
    2. Fixed bizarre problem involving the inability to process uploaded
       files that begin with a non alphabetic character in the file name.
    3. Fixed a bug in the hidden fields involving the -override directive
       being ignored when scalar defaults were passed.
    4. Added documentation on how to disable the SelfLoader features.

  Version 2.17

    1. Added support for the SelfLoader module.
    2. Added oodles of JavaScript support routines.
    3. Fixed bad bug in query_string() method that caused some parameters
       to be silently dropped.
    4. Robustified file upload code to handle premature termination by
       the client.
    5. Exported temporary file names on file upload.
    6. Removed spurious "uninitialized variable" warnings that appeared
       when running under 5.002.
    7. Added the Carp.pm library to the standard distribution.
    8. Fixed a number of errors in this documentation, and probably added
       a few more.
    9. Checkbox_group() and radio_group() now return the buttons as
       arrays, so that you can incorporate the individual buttons into
       specialized tables.
   10. Added the '-nolabels' option to checkbox_group() and
       radio_group(). Probably should be added to all the other
       HTML-generating routines.
   11. Added the url() method to recover the URL without the entire query
       string appended.
   12. Added request_method() to list of environment variables available.
   13. Would you believe it? Fixed hidden fields again!

  Version 2.16

    1. Fixed hidden fields yet again.
    2. Fixed subtle problems in the file upload method that caused
       intermittent failures (thanks to Keven Hendrick for this one).
    3. Made file upload more robust in the face of bizarre behavior by
       the Macintosh and Windows Netscape clients.
    4. Moved the POD documentation to the bottom of the module at the
       request of Stephen Dahmen.
    5. Added the -xbase parameter to the start_html() method, also at the
       request of Stephen Dahmen.
    6. Added JavaScript form buttons at Stephen's request. I'm not sure
       how to use this Netscape extension correctly, however, so for now
       the form() method is in the module as an undocumented feature. Use
       at your own risk!

  Version 2.15

    1. Added the -override parameter to all field-generating methods.
    2. Documented the user_name() and remote_user() methods.
    3. Fixed bugs that prevented empty strings from being recognized as
       valid textfield contents.
    4. Documented the use of framesets and added a frameset example.

  Version 2.14

   This was an internal experimental version that was never released.

  Version 2.13

    1. Fixed a bug that interfered with the value "0" being entered into
       text fields.

  Version 2.01

    1. Added -rows and -columns to the radio and checkbox groups. No
       doubt this will cause much grief because it seems to promise a
       level of meta-organization that it doesn't actually provide.
    2. Fixed a bug in the redirect() method -- it was not truly HTTP/1.0
       compliant.

  Version 2.0

   The changes seemed to touch every line of code, so I decided to bump
   up the major version number.
    1. Support for named parameter style method calls. This turns out
       to be a big win for extending CGI.pm when Netscape adds new HTML
       "features".
    2. Changed behavior of hidden fields back to the correct "sticky"
       behavior. This is going to break some programs, but it is for
       the best in the long run.
    3. Netscape 2.0b2 broke the file upload feature. CGI.pm now handles
       both 2.0b1 and 2.0b2-style uploading. It will probably break again
       in 2.0b3.
    4. There were still problems with library being unable to distinguish
       between a form being loaded for the first time, and a subsequent
       loading with all fields blank. We now forcibly create a default
       name for the Submit button (if not provided) so that there's
       always at least one parameter.
    5. More workarounds to prevent annoying spurious warning messages
       when run under the -w switch. -w is seriously broken in perl
       5.001!

  Version 1.57

    1. Support for the Netscape 2.0 "File upload" field.
    2. The handling of defaults for selected items in scrolling lists and
       multiple checkboxes is now consistent.

  Version 1.56

    1. Created true "pod" documentation for the module.
    2. Cleaned up the code to avoid many of the spurious "use of
       uninitialized variable" warnings when running with the -w switch.
    3. Added the autoEscape() method. v
    4. Added string interpolation of the CGI object.
    5. Added the ability to pass additional parameters to the <BODY> tag.
    6. Added the ability to specify the status code in the HTTP header.

  Bug fixes in version 1.55

    1. Every time self_url() was called, the parameter list would grow.
       This was a bad "feature".
    2. Documented the fact that you can pass "-" to radio_group() in
       order to prevent any button from being highlighted by default.

  Bug fixes in version 1.54

    1. The user_agent() method is now documented;
    2. A potential security hole in import() is now plugged.
    3. Changed name of import() to import_names() for compatibility with
       CGI:: modules.

  Bug fixes in version 1.53

    1. Fixed several typos in the code that were causing the following
       subroutines to fail in some circumstances
         1. checkbox()
         2. hidden()
    2. No features added

  New features added in version 1.52

    1. Added backslashing, quotation marks, and other shell-style escape
       sequences to the parameters passed in during debugging off-line.
    2. Changed the way that the hidden() method works so that the default
       value always overrides the current one.
    3. Improved the handling of sticky values in forms. It's now less
       likely that sticky values will get stuck.
    4. If you call server_name(), script_name() and several other methods
       when running offline, the methods now create "dummy" values to
       work with.

  Bugs fixed in version 1.51

    1. param() when called without arguments was returning an array of
       length 1 even when there were no parameters to be had. Bad bug!
       Bad!
    2. The HTML code generated would break if input fields contained the
       forbidden characters ">< or &. You can now use these characters
       freely.

  New features added in version 1.50

    1. import() method allows all the parameters to be imported into a
       namespace in one fell swoop.
    2. Parameters are now returned in the same order in which they were
       defined.

  Bugs fixed in version 1.45

    1. delete() method didn't work correctly. This is now fixed.
    2. reset() method didn't allow you to set the name of the button.
       Fixed.

  Bugs fixed in version 1.44

    1. self_url() didn't include the path information. This is now fixed.

  New features added in version 1.43

    1. Added the delete() method.

  New features added in version 1.42

    1. The image_button() method to create clickable images.
    2. A few bug fixes involving forms embedded in <PRE> blocks.

  New features added in version 1.4

    1. New header shortcut methods
          + redirect() to create HTTP redirection messages.
          + start_html() to create the HTML title, complete with the
            recommended <LINK> tag that no one ever remembers to include.
          + end_html() for completeness' sake.
    2. A new save() method that allows you to write out the state of an
       script to a file or pipe.
    3. An improved version of the new() method that allows you to restore
       the state of a script from a file or pipe. With (2) this gives you
       dump and restore capabilities! (Wow, you can put a "121,931
       customers served" banner at the bottom of your pages!)
    4. A self_url() method that allows you to create state-maintaining
       hypertext links. In addition to allowing you to maintain the state
       of your scripts between invocations, this lets you work around a
       problem that some browsers have when jumping to internal links in
       a document that contains a form -- the form information gets lost.
    5. The user-visible labels in checkboxes, radio buttons, popup menus
       and scrolling lists have now been decoupled from the values sent
       to your CGI script. Your script can know a checkbox by the name of
       "cb1" while the user knows it by a more descriptive name. I've
       also added some parameters that were missing from the text fields,
       such as MAXLENGTH.
    6. A whole bunch of methods have been added to get at environment
       variables involved in user verification and other obscure
       features.

  Bug fixes

    1. The problems with the hidden fields have (I hope at last) been
       fixed.
    2. You can create multiple query objects and they will all be
       initialized correctly. This simplifies the creation of multiple
       forms on one page.
    3. The URL unescaping code works correctly now.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
