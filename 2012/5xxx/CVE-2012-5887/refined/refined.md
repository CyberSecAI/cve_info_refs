Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5887:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided text snippets confirm that CVE-2012-5887 is related to a vulnerability in the DIGEST authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat. It is consistently mentioned alongside CVE-2012-5885 and CVE-2012-5886, which are related to the same flaw.  Specifically, CVE-2012-5887 refers to the "stale nonce weakness."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2012-5887 lies in how Tomcat's DIGEST authentication handles stale nonces. Specifically the issue is:

*   The user name and password were not checked before indicating that a nonce was stale.

This allows for replay attacks in some circumstances due to a lack of proper checking of nonces and related parameters.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core weakness is an improper handling of stale nonces within Tomcat's DIGEST authentication implementation. By not validating user credentials before marking a nonce as stale, the door is opened for attackers to potentially use outdated nonces in replay attacks if they have captured a valid credential previously.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to:

*   **Bypass Authentication**: By replaying captured requests containing stale nonces (due to the user credentials not being checked against them).
*   **Gain unauthorized access:** Potentially accessing protected resources or functionality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could sniff network traffic to intercept legitimate requests including authentication data and nonces.
*   **Replay Attack:**  The attacker would replay these captured requests using the stale nonce, taking advantage of the lack of credential checking.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic to capture valid authentication requests.
*   **Ability to Replay traffic**: The attacker needs to be able to retransmit captured requests to the server.
*   **No prior authentication needed**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication before attempting the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is part of a larger set of issues in Tomcat's DIGEST authentication implementation, also covered by CVE-2012-5885 and CVE-2012-5886.
* Patches were applied to multiple versions of Tomcat to fix the problem.
* The issue affects versions of Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30
* The fix involves changing how nonces are tracked and checked and requires a server restart to take full effect.
* Patches are provided as source code changes and not binary updates.

The content provides details about the vulnerability and its exploitation, making it highly relevant to CVE-2012-5887.
