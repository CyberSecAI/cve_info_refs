{
  "CVE-2012-5575": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks in the XML encryption process within Apache CXF and JBoss Web Services. Specifically, the system does not verify if the algorithm used in an encrypted message corresponds to what is specified by the WS-SecurityPolicy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks",
       "Use of insecure legacy cryptosystems",
       "Lack of algorithm verification in XML encryption"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can force the server to use weak, legacy cryptographic algorithms (e.g., CBC mode), even when secure algorithms (e.g., GCM mode) are enabled. This can expose flaws in those legacy systems and allow the attacker to recover plain text from encrypted data and symmetric keys.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating XML messages to force the server to revert to legacy encryption methods.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted XML messages to the vulnerable server."
