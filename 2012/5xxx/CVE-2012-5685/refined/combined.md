# Insufficient CSRF protection (CVE-2012-5683)
# All sensitive functions are lacking CSRF protection. One example below is
a request showing no authorization token is required for the creation of a
FTP user called "fun". This could also be used to deliver both XSS
(CVE-2012-5684) and SQLi (CVE-2012-5685) examples below.

# SQL Injection (CVE-2012-5685)
# "inEmailAddress" parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. Since the
injection point is in an UPDATE statement its trivial to manipulate the
content of the database. For instance the zadmin password could be changed
to password.(5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99)

# One more sqli example
# A user can extract data from db though an UPDATE statement by using a
subquery. As long as we update a field that is displayed back to us. To
reproduce this example you need to know your ClientID which can be found in
the referring page's url as the value of "other". In this example we use
the email field to hold the result of the subquery. Usually you can't
select from the table you're updating but by creating a temporary table
called "fun" we can avoid that. Using group_concat we get all columns and
all rows as a single string so that it all fits nicely in a single field.

# Password Reset Weakness, Insufficient entropy (CVE-2012-5686)
# "randomkey" is not sufficiently random. By knowing server time an
attacker could reset a password and guess the key within a relatively low
number of requests.  If the attacker can receive a password reset email for
any account on the system (demo account?) the number of attempts required
to guess reset key for another user (zadmin) can be greatly reduced.  Since
the zadmin default admin account is "hard coded" it is especially at risk
to this password reset weakness. If you change zadmin username in the
zpanel_core db my experience is that you cannot load zpanel control panel.
#

# ZPanel source code for [INSTALL_DIR]/inc/init.inc.php
 38    $randomkey = sha1(microtime());
 46      $zdbh->exec("UPDATE x_accounts SET ac_resethash_tx = '" .
$randomkey . "' WHERE ac_id_pk=" . $result['ac_id_pk'] . "");
 50      $phpmailer->Body = "Hi " . $result['ac_user_vc'] . ",
 51     You or somebody pretending to be you has requested a password reset
link to be sent for your web hosting control panel login at: " .
ctrl_options::GetOption('cp_url') . "
 52    If you wish to proceed with the password reset on your account
please use this link below to be taken to the password reset page.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
