- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation on the Health Monitor Login pages of Cisco Prime NCS and WCS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). This allows for injection of arbitrary HTML content, including script, into web pages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into a web page displayed to the user. This code can steal authentication cookies or other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected through a request and reflected back to the user in the response. Specifically, it targets the Health Monitor Login pages of Cisco Prime NCS and WCS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or manipulate a request containing the malicious script, which is then reflected back in the response to the victim's browser. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to launch this attack.
