| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 5.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 4.1 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 4.1 |

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the user-supplied password when TACACS+ is the authentication protocol and Cisco Secure ACS is configured with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) external identity store.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products The following Cisco Secure ACS versions are affected by this   vulnerability:       | Cisco Secure ACS Version | Affected |   | --- | --- |   | 5.0 | Yes |   | 5.1 | Yes |   | 5.2 | Yes |   | 5.3 | Yes |   | 5.4 | No |       The previous list applies to both the hardware appliance and the   software-only versions of the product.  The following methods can be used to determine which version of the   Cisco Secure ACS is installed:    + From the Cisco Secure ACS command-line interface (CLI), issue the     **show version** command, as shown in the following     example: ```     acs51a/admin# show version          Cisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 1.2     ADE-OS Build Version: 1.2.0.152     ADE-OS System Architecture: i386          Copyright (c) 2005-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.     All rights reserved.     Hostname: acs51a               Version information of installed applications     ---------------------------------------------                Cisco ACS VERSION INFORMATION     -----------------------------     Version : 5.1.0.44.6     Internal Build ID : B.2347     Patches :      5-1-0-44-3     5-1-0-44-6          acs51a/admin#     ```   + On the main login page of the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface,     the version information is displayed on the left side of the screen.   + From the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface, log in and click the     **About** link at the top right corner of the screen. Cisco Secure ACS version 5.1 will identify itself as version   **5.1.0.44**, Cisco Secure ACS version 5.2 will identify   itself as version **5.2.0.26** and Cisco Secure ACS version 5.3 will identify   itself as version **5.3.0.40**. The presence of an additional   digit after the version number indicates the highest patch level installed. For   example, a version number of **5.1.0.44.3** indicates Cisco Secure   ACS version 5.1 with up to patch 3 installed. The absence of any additional   digit after the version string indicates a Cisco Secure ACS version with no   patches installed. The example above shows a Cisco Secure ACS running version 5.1 Patch 6.    Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following Cisco Secure ACS products are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server Express   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server View   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server Solution EngineNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) operates as a centralized RADIUS and TACACS+ server,   combining user authentication, user and administrator device access control,   and policy control into a centralized identity networking solution.      Cisco Secure ACS provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services to network devices and other clients by using the Cisco Secure ACS network resource repositories and identity stores. The identity stores can be internal or external. An internal identity store has user credentials information stored in an internal database. In an external identity store, Cisco Secure ACS will retrieve information from an external database.      Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) contains a vulnerability that could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the TACACS+ based authentication   service offered by the affected product.      The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the user-supplied password when TACACS+ is as authentication protocol and Cisco   Secure ACS is configured with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol   (LDAP) external identity store.   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a special sequence   of   characters when prompted for the user password. The attacker would need to know a valid username stored in the LDAP external   identity store in order to exploit this   vulnerability, and the exploitation is limited to impersonate only that user. An exploit could allow the attacker to successfully authenticate   to any system using TACACS+ in combination with an affected Cisco Secure   ACS.      **Note:** Only a Cisco Secure ACS that is configured for TACACS+ authentication and uses LDAP as the external identity store is vulnerable.   A Cisco Secure ACS used for authentication service in combination with other supported protocols, such as RADIUS, or TACACS+ used in combination with an internal identity store or other external stores (for example, RADIUS Identity Server, Active Directory,   and RSA SecurID Token Server),      is not vulnerable.       Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to bypass the   authentication of any system that uses TACACS+ and relies on the authentication service provided by an   affected Cisco Secure ACS. However, the attacker will not be able to gain unauthorized access to the management interface of the Cisco Secure ACS.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc65634](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc65634) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   and has been assigned   the CVE identifier CVE-2012-5424.  Workarounds  * There is no workaround for this vulnerability. If possible, disable anonymous   binding on the LDAP external identity store or use Active Directory external   identity store to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * The following table provides software upgrade information to mitigate the vulnerability described in this security   advisory:      | Cisco Secure ACS Version | Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 5.0 | Migrate to 5.2 Patch 11 |   | 5.1 | Migrate to 5.2 Patch 11 |   | 5.2 | 5.2 Patch 11 |   | 5.3 | 5.3 Patch 7 |       When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded   contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and   software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the   new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to   contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted   maintenance providers.

An exploit could allow the attacker to successfully authenticate   to any system using TACACS+ in combination with an affected Cisco Secure   ACS.      **Note:** Only a Cisco Secure ACS that is configured for TACACS+ authentication and uses LDAP as the external identity store is vulnerable.   A Cisco Secure ACS used for authentication service in combination with other supported protocols, such as RADIUS, or TACACS+ used in combination with an internal identity store or other external stores (for example, RADIUS Identity Server, Active Directory,   and RSA SecurID Token Server),      is not vulnerable.       Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to bypass the   authentication of any system that uses TACACS+ and relies on the authentication service provided by an   affected Cisco Secure ACS. However, the attacker will not be able to gain unauthorized access to the management interface of the Cisco Secure ACS.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc65634](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc65634) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   and has been assigned   the CVE identifier CVE-2012-5424.  Workarounds  * There is no workaround for this vulnerability. If possible, disable anonymous   binding on the LDAP external identity store or use Active Directory external   identity store to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * The following table provides software upgrade information to mitigate the vulnerability described in this security   advisory:      | Cisco Secure ACS Version | Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 5.0 | Migrate to 5.2 Patch 11 |   | 5.1 | Migrate to 5.2 Patch 11 |   | 5.2 | 5.2 Patch 11 |   | 5.3 | 5.3 Patch 7 |       When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded   contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and   software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the   new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to   contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted   maintenance providers.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
