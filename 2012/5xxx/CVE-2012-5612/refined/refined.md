Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-5612:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the MySQL MDL (Metadata Locking) subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The vulnerability stems from improper handling of memory allocation within the MDL subsystem, leading to a buffer overflow in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the `mysqld` server to crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Potentially, the vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the MySQL server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** Exploitation occurs through network connections to the MySQL server.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated database user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to connect to the MySQL database server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to know how to trigger the heap-based buffer overflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects MySQL versions 5.5 and higher, as the MDL subsystem was introduced in 5.5.
- The vulnerability was addressed in MySQL version 5.5.29.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 were not affected, as they used older MySQL versions (5.0.x and 5.1.x respectively) that did not include the vulnerable MDL subsystem.
- The exploit involves crafting long table aliases in queries, causing a server crash.
- A proof-of-concept exploit exists.
- The vulnerability is triggered during cleanup operations in the `free_root` function.
