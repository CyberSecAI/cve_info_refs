### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Hi,

the following vulnerabilities were published for libuser.

[CVE-2012-5630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5630)[0]:
TOCTOU race conditions by copying and removing directory trees

[CVE-2012-5644](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5644)[1]:
(Complete) Information disclosure when moving user's home directory

The patch however looks unfortunately quite substantial, see [2], so
might be better to update for unstable directly to the new upstream
version.

Ghe, are you still interested/maintaining the package? I wonder
because there was no upload since 2008 apart NMUs.

If you fix the vulnerabilities please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) ids in your changelog entry.

For further information see:

[0] <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5630>
[1] <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5644>
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=885724#c7>

Salvatore

Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:46:23 +0200
```
Hi,

It seems that libuser has not recieved any decent maintinance in recent
years. As its removal will remove my package (mock), I tried fixing this
bug.

It turned out to be more complicated than I thought, and I ended up
recreating the packaging altogether. See libuser.git on collab-maint:

Hi Tzafir,

thanks for taking a look at libuser and keeping mock in Debian testing.

Do you need any help with the fixing of libuser? Let me know.

Mike

/me uses mock a lot esp. on jenkins.x2go.org and /me is also
responsible for the mock package in wheezy-backports.

I refreshed that repository (this will require forced update, if you
already checked out that package).

I used git-dpm this time (it looked interesting and I wanted to give it
a shot).

I marked myself as uploader in order to silent Lintian. Though if there
are any objections to that, I don't have any issues with removing it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=884685#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-06 14:52:36 UTC  ``` A TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition was found in the way libuser, a user and group account administration library, performed copying and removal of (user) directory trees. A local attacker, with permissions to write into particular directory, could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, leading to their ability to alter / remove directories outside of this directory (tree), if this directory was simultaneously modified (copied or removed) via libuser functionality.
