- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The D-Link DCS series network cameras have a web interface vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web interface lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the administrator password of the vulnerable D-Link camera.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, changes the administrator password. The victim needs to be logged into the camera's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page and trick a logged-in administrator of the target camera into visiting it. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the camera.
