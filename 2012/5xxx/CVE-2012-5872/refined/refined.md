The provided content is related to CVE-2012-5872.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the inclusion of user-controlled input within SQL comments during query debugging, without sanitization or proper encoding. This occurs in the `getTriplePatternSQL()` function within "ARC2_StoreSelectQueryHandler.php."

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection vulnerability. User-supplied data within a SPARQL WHERE clause is directly inserted into SQL comments which are part of the executed query. This allows the injection of SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full control over the database (C:C/I:C/A:C)
- The attacker can read, modify and delete data from the database
- The attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the application and potentially the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network based (AV:N)
- Exploitation is done by crafting a specific SPARQL query that includes malicious SQL code
- The attacker sends this malicious query to the vulnerable SPARQL endpoint

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication or privileges (Au:N)
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the vulnerable service.
- The attacker can be remote.
