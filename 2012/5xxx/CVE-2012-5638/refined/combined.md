| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=887010#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-12-13 20:08:03 UTC  ``` The sanlock server creates the /var/log/sanlock.log world writable allowing  any one on the system to wipe the contents of the log file or to store data  within the log file (bypassing any quotas applied to their account). The  affected code is:  src/log.h  int setup_logging(void) {         int fd, rv;         snprintf(logfile_path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s", SANLK_LOG_DIR,                  SANLK_LOGFILE_NAME);         logfile_fp = fopen(logfile_path, "a+");   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=887010#c2)  Martin Quinson    2012-12-24 21:28:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 668606](attachment.cgi?id=668606&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=668606&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch  This is just a starting point, as I was not able to test the patch myself. Also, I used 660 as permissions to the file, I'm not sure of whether it's sensible or not.  Please review and test before applying.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=887010#c3)  David Teigland    2013-01-02 16:28:29 UTC  ``` This problem was fixed in [bug 849181](show_bug.cgi?id=849181 "CLOSED ERRATA - fix file permissions").   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=887010#c4)  Murray McAllister    2013-03-28 02:03:57 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=887010#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-28 22:28:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Storage 2.0   Red Hat Storage 2.0 Console   Native Client for RHEL 5 for Red Hat Storage   Native Client for RHEL 6 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2013:0691 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0691.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated Red Hat Storage 2.0 packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add enhancements are now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Storage is a software only, scale-out storage solution that
provides flexible and agile unstructured data storage for the enterprise.

A flaw was found in the way the Swift component used Python pickle. This
could lead to arbitrary code execution. With this update, the JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) format is used. (CVE-2012-4406)

Multiple insecure temporary file creation flaws were found in Red Hat
Storage. A local user on the Red Hat Storage server could use these flaws
to cause arbitrary files to be overwritten as the root user via a symbolic
link attack. (CVE-2012-5635)

It was found that sanlock created "/var/run/sanlock/sanlock.pid" with
world-writable permissions. A local user could use this flaw to make the
sanlock init script kill an arbitrary process when the sanlock daemon is
stopped or restarted. Additionally, "/var/log/sanlock.log" was also
world-writable, allowing local users to modify the contents of the log
file, or store data within it (bypassing any quotas applied to their
account). (CVE-2012-5638)

Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for
reporting CVE-2012-4406. The CVE-2012-5635 issues were discovered by Kurt
Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team and Michael Scherer of the
Red Hat Regional IT team, and CVE-2012-5638 was discovered by David
Teigland of Red Hat.

Bug fixes and enhancements:

* Options to provide POSIX behavior when the O\_DIRECT flag is used with

the open() system call across many translators. (BZ#856156)

* A mount time option provided to make the FUSE module's request queue

length configurable. (BZ#856206)

* Various fixes in the FUSE module to ensure the 'read-only' (-o ro) mount

option works. (BZ#858499)

* Various fixes in GlusterFS's rebalance code to handle failures while

replica pairs are getting connected and disconnected in quick succession.
(BZ#859387)

* NFS code fixed to ensure proper inode transformation logic when the

'enable-ino32' option is set. (BZ#864222)

* Fixed the behavior of the posix-locks module per POSIX locking

semantics. As a result, smb-torture's ping-pong tests now run smoothly on
top of GlusterFS mounts. (BZ#869724)

* FUSE module enhanced with the enable-ino32 mount option, required by any

32-bit applications running on top of a GlusterFS mount. (BZ#876679)

* Corrections were made to fd table behavior when both NFS and

geo-replication are in progress. (BZ#880193)

* With this update, disconnections are now handled better in the

geo-replication 'gsyncd' process. (BZ#880308)

* With this update, the 'gluster volume geo-replication config checkpoint'

command returns the output value properly. (BZ#881736)

* With this enhancement, it is possible to set the 'root-squash' volume

option with Gluster CLI. Red Hat Storage volumes now support NFS's
root-squashing behavior. (BZ#883590)

* NFS POSIX lock issue fixed when 'root-squash' option is enabled on the

volume. (BZ#906884)

* Fixed an issue in tracking the changes of Geo-replication when an

unprivileged user accesses the file system. (BZ#883827)

* Fixed NFS locking manager (NLM) code to handle IP failover successfully.

(BZ#888286)

* Fixed issue in rebalance code to handle proper pointer dereference.

(BZ#894237)

* POSIX module made more robust to handle backend brick failures better.

(BZ#895841)

* Fixed the 'gluster volume geo-replication' command to provide a

meaningful message when a wrong hostname is entered. (BZ#902213)

* Fixed Console Configuration Script where it added invalid 'security'

configuration for ENGINEDataSource in JBoss. (BZ#922572)

* Fixed rhsc-setup failure where it does not check for SELinux before

running setsebool. (BZ#923674)

* Provided an update to the rhn-client-tools package to ensure setup

defaults to the correct base Red Hat Enterprise Linux (6.2 Extended Update
Support). (BZ#911777)

Refer to the Release Notes, available shortly from the link in the
References section, for further information.

Consequence: Since lstat's return value was checked only for -1, other non-zero value was assumed to be success and success was returned to other xlators. But the fop was a filed fop and many of the pointers were NULL. When some other component got success and accessed one of the pointers, the process crashed. Fix: Fix is check for 0 after lstat call and any value other than 0 is treated as a failure and the same is returned to the other components. Result: Now if there is a backend failure and a system call returns some value other that 0 or -1, then that system call is treated as failure and error is returned to the application. | | | Clone Of: | [864401](show_bug.cgi?id=864401 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [glusterfs-3.3.1qa3]: glusterfs client asserted") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2013-03-28 22:28:36 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | | [Dependent Products:](page.cgi?id=fields.html#dependent_products "Other Products that are affected by this bug.") | Red Hat Ceph Storage Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager | |

Thus posix xlator did not create the dictionary which contains the xattrs information of lookup and thus returned NULL dictionary.   This is the o/p of dmesg:  XFS (dm-8): xfs_log_force: error 5 returned. XFS (dm-7): xfs_log_force: error 5 returned. XFS (dm-8): xfs_log_force: error 5 returned.

Steps to reproduce:  Simulate a backend xfs failure such that when a system call(lstat in this case) is executed instead of 0 (for success) or -1 (for failure) some other value is be returned.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=895841#c6)  Divya    2013-02-12 12:06:10 UTC  ``` Raghavendra,  This bug has been added to Update 4 errata. Could you provide your inputs in doc text field which will enable me to update errata??  Thanks, Divya   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=895841#c7)  Sachidananda Urs    2013-03-04 10:47:41 UTC  ``` Marking the bug as resolved, unable to reproduce the issue. Tried with NFS and FUSE clients on the volume. Was not able to induce the crash.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=895841#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-28 22:28:36 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
