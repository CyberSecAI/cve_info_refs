Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the `user_webdavauth` component of ownCloud. Specifically, it appears to be related to how user-provided input is handled within the `settings.php` file of the `user_webdavauth` app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a page with the injected malicious script.
- **Session Hijacking:** XSS can be used to steal session cookies, enabling attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially steal user data, modify the content of the web page, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of ownCloud. The vulnerability lies within a setting or page associated with the `user_webdavauth` app.
- **Malicious Input Injection:** The attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code as input within the `user_webdavauth` settings or via some other vector where user data is used in the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ownCloud instance.
- **User Interaction:** While the injected script is automatically executed in the victim's browser once triggered, the attacker might need a user to interact with a specific part of the application (such as the user webdav settings page) or visit a crafted URL.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs knowledge or ability to find the vulnerable input parameters or areas that allow them to inject the malicious javascript payload.

**Additional details**
The provided github commit (`054c168b32bc4690642b0ffdcee214cd6b6496cb`) reveals a minor change to the `apps/user_webdavauth/settings.php` file, where debugging output (`print_r($_POST);`) is removed, but does not contain information about the vulnerability fix itself. This suggests the fix for the XSS was likely done in a separate commit.
