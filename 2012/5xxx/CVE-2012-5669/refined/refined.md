      "description": "A flaw was found in the way the FreeType font rendering engine processed certain Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) fonts. If a user loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-5669)",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the FreeType font rendering engine when processing certain Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) fonts, specifically within the `_bdf_parse_glyphs` function. An incorrect array size is used for checking `glyph_enc`.",

          "Heap-based buffer over-read",
          "Out-of-bounds read",
