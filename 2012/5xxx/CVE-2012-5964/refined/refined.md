Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-5964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `unique_service_name()` function of the Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) library. This function is responsible for handling Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple stack-based buffer overflows exist in the `unique_service_name()` function when processing SSDP requests.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific SSDP queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the vulnerable daemon.
- Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution by overwriting the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via network-based SSDP queries sent over UDP port 1900.
- Devices that expose UPnP to the internet are at risk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- They must be able to send crafted SSDP queries to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by HD Moore of Rapid7.
- The issue affects a wide range of devices and applications using the vulnerable libupnp library.
- The affected versions include 1.2 (Intel SDK) and 1.2.1a - 1.8.0 (Portable SDK), specifically versions prior to 1.6.18, which fixed the issue.
- The advisory also mentions that devices using libupnp might accept UPnP queries over the WAN interface, increasing the exposure.
