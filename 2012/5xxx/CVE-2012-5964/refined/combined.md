Debian Bug     : 699459

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in libupnp4, a library
used for handling the Universal Plug and Play protocol. HD Moore from Rapid7
discovered that SSDP queries where not correctly handled by the
unique_service_name() function.

An attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on
libupnp4 could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to
the daemon crash and possible remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp4 packages.

An attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on libupnp
could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to the daemon
crash and possible remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.6-5+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp packages.

This library is used in several vendor network devices, in addition to media streaming and file sharing applications. These vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 29th, 2013 in a CERT Vulnerability Note, VU#922681, which can be viewed at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681>.  Affected Products  * Cisco is currently evaluating products for possible exposure to these UPnP vulnerabilities. Products will only be listed in the "Vulnerable Products" or "Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" sections of this advisory when a final determination about product exposure is made. Products that are not listed in either of these two sections are still being evaluated.   Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco TelePresence C Series Endpoints   + Cisco TelePresence System EX Series   + Cisco TelePresence SX20This section will be updated when more information is available.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are not affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco TelePresence EC20   + Cisco Telepresence Touch DevicesCisco Products based on IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR, and NX-OS do not use libupnp and are not affected.      The Cisco ASA Series Adaptive Security Appliance and the Firewall Services Modules (FWSM) do not use libupnp and are not affected.      This section will be updated when more information is available.  Details  * UPnP™ is an architecture that enables discovery, event notification, and control of devices on a network, independent of operating system, programming language, or physical network connection. UPnP™ is based on common Internet standards and specifications such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and XML.      The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices is affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in the processing of incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. CERT released the following CVE IDs to document these vulnerabilities: CVE-2012-5958, CVE-2012-5959, CVE-2012-5960, CVE-2012-5961, CVE-2012-5962, CVE-2012-5963, CVE-2012-5964, and CVE-2012-5965.      The following Cisco bug IDs are being used to track potential exposure to the UPnP issues. The bugs listed below do not confirm that a product is vulnerable, but rather that the product is under investigation by the appropriate product teams.      Registered Cisco customers can view these bugs via the Cisco Bug Toolkit: <http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl>      | Product | Bug ID |   | --- | --- |   | Cisco AP541N Wireless Access Point | CSCue19294 |   | Cisco NSS300 Series Smart Storage\*\* | CSCue19395 |   | Cisco PVC2300 Business Internet Video Camera\*\* | CSCue21009 |   | Cisco RV0XX Series Routers\*\* | CSCue20980 |   | Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall | CSCue20983 |   | Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall | CSCue20983 |   | Cisco RVL200 VPN Router\*\* | CSCue20989 |   | Cisco RVS4000 Gigabit Security Router\*\* | CSCue20997 |   | Cisco Small Business ISA500 Series Integrated Security Appliances | CSCue19341 |   | Cisco Small Business SA500 Series Security Appliances | CSCue21031 |   | Cisco TelePresence C Series Endpoints | CSCue19318 |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | CSCue19318 |   | Cisco TelePresence SX20 | CSCue19318 |   | Cisco WAP4400N Wireless-N Access Point | CSCue21567 |   | Cisco WET200 Wireless-G Business Ethernet Bridge | CSCue21572 |   | Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router\*\* | CSCue21578 |   | Cisco WRV200 Wireless-G VPN Router\*\* | CSCue21578 |            \*\*NOTE: This product is no longer being sold and might not be supported.

View the RV Series Routers End-of-Life Notices at <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9923/prod_eol_notices_list.html>  Workarounds  * UPnP can be disabled on many devices using the Web User Interface. Instructions on how to disable UPnP are generally given in the *Product Administration Guide*. For example, in the "Configuring Basic Firewall Settings" section of the *RV-120W Administration Guide*, there is a checkbox to enable/disable UPnP. For additional information, see <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/csbr/rv110w/administration/guide/rv110w_admin.pdf#page84>.      Customers should follow basic hardening rules when configuring wireless devices, such as not allowing "Guest" access and requiring authentication credentials to login.       Customers can also block traffic from untrusted hosts on UDP port 1900 to affected devices using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs). This protection mechanism filters and drops packets that are attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities.      Effective exploit prevention can also be provided by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance and the Firewall Services Module (FWSM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600 Series routers using transit access control lists (tACLs).      Cisco has released an Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) that explains how to detect and mitigate potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities. The AMB is available at: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28005>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.       In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * This issue was coordinated and disclosed by CERT-CC. Their Vulnerability Note can be viewed at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681>.

# Security Flaws in Universal Plug and Play: Unplug, Don't Play

* Jan 29, 2013
* 3 min read
* [HD Moore](/blog/author/hd-moore/)

*Last updated at Tue, 03 Sep 2024 20:46:00 GMT*

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/post-images/14058/stats.png#img-half-right)

This morning we released a whitepaper entitled [Security Flaws in Universal Plug and Play](https://information.rapid7.com/rs/411-NAK-970/images/SecurityFlawsUPnP%20%281%29.pdf). This paper is the result of a research project spanning the second half of 2012 that measured the global exposure of UPnP-enabled network devices. The results were shocking to the say the least. Over 80 million unique IPs were identified that responded to UPnP discovery requests from the internet. Somewhere between 40 and 50 million IPs are vulnerable to at least one of three attacks outlined in this paper. The two most commonly used UPnP software libraries both contained remotely exploitable vulnerabilities. In the case of the [Portable UPnP SDK](http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/), over 23 million IPs are vulnerable to remote code execution through a single UDP packet. All told, we were able to identify over 6,900 product versions that were vulnerable through UPnP. This list encompasses over 1,500 vendors and only took into account devices that exposed the UPnP SOAP service to the internet, a serious vulnerability in of itself.

The vulnerabilities we identified in the Portable UPnP SDK have been fixed as of version 1.6.18 (released today), but it will take a long time before each of the application and device vendors incorporate this patch into their products. In most cases, network equipment that is "no longer shipping" will not be updated at all, exposing these users to remote compromise until UPnP is disabled or the product is swapped for something new. The flaws identified in the [MiniUPnP](http://miniupnp.free.fr/) software were fixed over two years ago, yet over 330 products are still using older versions.

For the reasons outlined above, we strongly suggest that end users, companies, and ISPs take immediate action to identify and disable any internet-exposed UPnP endpoints in their environments. UPnP is pervasive - it is enabled by default on many home gateways, nearly all network printers, and devices ranging from IP cameras to network storage servers.

To this end, we have provided [ScanNow UPnP](http://www.rapid7.com/resources/free-security-software-downloads/universal-plug-and-play-jan-2013.jsp), a free tool that can identify exposed UPnP endpoints in your network and flag which of those may remotely exploitable through recently discovered vulnerabilities. A screenshot of this tool in action in the lower right.

If you are accessing the internet from your home network, we now offer an alternative to ScanNow and Metasploit. The [Rapid7 UPnP Check](http://upnp-check.rapid7.com/) is a one-click security scan for broadband and mobile users. If you are concerned about the security of your non-technical friends and family, this is a quick way for them to check their home router for UPnP vulnerabilities. The main difference between this service and ScanNow is that the UPnP Check will run a scan from the internet and can only check the external interface of your router.

Although ScanNow only supports Microsoft Windows, users of Mac OS X and Linux can accomplish the same task using [Metasploit.](http://www.rapid7.com/downloads/metasploit.jsp) To use the latest module,which includes vulnerability reporting for the recently disclosed vulnerabilities, make sure you have the most current update applied.

Using this module within Metasploit's web interface is simple. Create a new project and access the Modules tab. In the search bar, enter "ssdp\_msearch", then select the module named **UPnP SSDP M-SEARCH Information Discovery**. Enter the network range you want to scan and Metasploit will take care of the rest. The module will run in the background and the Analysis tab will be updated with hosts and vulnerabilities as they are found.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/post-images/14058/scannow.png#img-half-right)

To accomplish the same task using the command-line, first open the Metasploit console.

```
$ msfconsole
msf>

```

From the msf prompt, enter the following commands, substituting your own network for RHOSTS

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/upnp/ssdp_msearch

msf  auxiliary(ssdp_msearch) > set RHOSTS 192.168.0.0/24

msf  auxiliary(ssdp_msearch) > run

```

## Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) contains multiple buffer overflows in SSDP

#### Vulnerability Note VU#922681

Original Release Date: 2013-01-29 | Last Revised: 2014-07-30

---

### Overview

The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices libupnp library contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Devices that use libupnp may also [accept UPnP queries over the WAN interface](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/357851), therefore exposing the vulnerabilities to the internet.

### Description

| Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of network protocols designed to support automatic discovery and service configuration. The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) is an open source project that has its roots in the Linux SDK for UPnP Devices and software from Intel (Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies and later Developer Tools for UPnP Technologies). Intel no longer maintains or supports these tools. Many different vendors produce UPnP-enabled devices that use libupnp.  As part of a large scale security research project, [Rapid7](http://www.rapid7.com/) investigated internet-connected UPnP devices and found, among other security issues, multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the libupnp implementation of the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). Rapid7's report summarizes these vulnerabilities:***Portable SDK for UPnP Devices unique\_service\_name() Buffer Overflows****The libupnp library is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows when handling malicious SSDP requests. This library is used by tens of millions of deployed network devices, of which approximately twenty million are exposed directly to the internet. In addition to network devices, many streaming media and file sharing applications are also exposed to attack through this library.**This advisory does not address historic or current vulnerabilities in the HTTP and SOAP processing code of libupnp.****Affected Versions****Versions 1.2 (Intel SDK) and 1.2.1a - 1.8.0 (Portable SDK) are affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows in the unique\_service\_name() function, which is called to process incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. Additionally, versions prior to 1.6.17 are vulnerable to additional issues in the same function. Please see Appendix A for a review of the vulnerable code by version.****Affected Vendors****Hundreds of vendors have used the libupnp library in their products, many of which are acting as the home routers for consumer networks. Any application linking to libupnp is likely to be affected and a list of confirmed vendors and products is provided in Appendix B.*Additional details may be found in a [paper](https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-2150) and [advisory](https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2013/01/29/security-flaws-in-universal-plug-and-play-unplug-dont-play) from Rapid7. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**[libupnp 1.6.18](http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/) has been released to address these vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Deploy firewall rules to block untrusted hosts from being able to access port 1900/udp.**Disable UPnP**Consider disabling UPnP on the device if it is not absolutely necessary. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| We attempted to notify more than 200 vendors identified by Rapid7 as running libupnp. The following list includes vendors who responded to our notification and vendors for whom we had existing security contact information. |

### [ipitomy](#BLUU-93RU74) Affected

Notified:  January 08, 2013  Updated: February 01, 2013

**Statement Date:   January 31, 2013**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

IPitomy Communications

Response to CERT VU#922681
1/31/2013

**Summary**

The Software Developer Kit (SDK) for Universal Plug-n-Play (UPnP) Devices contains a library originally developed as the Intel SDK for UPnP Devices. Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been found in the popular versions of this library used on many network vendor devices. For more information on this vulnerability please visit: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681>

**Affected Products**

IPitomy has not confirmed the vulnerability yet and is still investigating. However we are listing below the only products that could be affected as well as the recommended steps to prevent any potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

**IP1000 and IP1000v2**

 These products contain an affected version of the UPnP library. IPitomy recommends disabling UPnP permanently on these products.
 This product defaults the UPnP setting to “on”.
 Note we have scanned the IP1000 products from the WAN side and have determined that with the UPnP service on, the systems do not respond to UPnP requests from the WAN, therefore exploitation of these UPnP vulnerabilities would have to occur from the LAN side of the device.

**IPR20**

 IPR20 contains router functionality. The UPnP service is disabled by default on these devices. IPitomy recommends that you ensure that UPnP service is disabled.
 IPitomy has confirmed that if UPnP service is enabled the device does not respond to UPnP requests on the WAN interface, therefore exploitation of these UPnP vulnerabilities would have to occur through the LAN side of the device.
 Properly installed (IPR20 WAN port connected to customer LAN), devices should not present these vulnerabilities.

Revision: 1.0

Title:
Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) contains multiple buffer overflows in SSDP
(US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#922681)

Summary:
US-CERT Note VU#922681 describes that the "Portable SDK for UPnP Devices libupnp" library contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Devices that use "libupnp" may also accept UPnP queries over the WAN interface, therefore exposing the vulnerabilities to the internet. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause a denial of service.

Details can be found at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681> and <https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-2150>

Comment:
The UPnP implemention used in the BOSS operating system is a proprietary solution developed by Teldat, and no Teldat product running the BOSS operating system is affected. Note that products sold under the former company name of "Funkwerk Enterprise Communications" - if running the BOSS operating system - are equally not affected by this vulnaerablity.
