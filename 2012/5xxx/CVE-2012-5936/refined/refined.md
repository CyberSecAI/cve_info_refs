Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that session or sensitive cookies in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway do not have the "secure" attribute enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of the "secure" attribute on session cookies. This attribute is crucial for ensuring that cookies are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. Without it, cookies can be sent over unencrypted HTTP connections, making them susceptible to interception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is cookie hijacking. An attacker who intercepts a cookie can potentially impersonate a legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to the application and potentially sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves an attacker intercepting network traffic, specifically HTTP requests. If a user connects to the application over an unencrypted HTTP connection, the attacker can capture the session cookies transmitted in the HTTP headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the server. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks on a network.
*   Compromising the network infrastructure.
*   Gaining access to the user's machine if it is on the same network as the attacker.
*   Compromising DNS servers, or routing to redirect traffic to a malicious server under attacker's control.
