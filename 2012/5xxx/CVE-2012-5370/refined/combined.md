# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

RHSA-2013:0533 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2013:0533 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1, which fixes multiple security issues,
various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

This release of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 serves as a replacement
for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0. It includes various bug fixes and
enhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1
Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/>

## Description

Security:

JBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric
keys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire
plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)

Spring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)
expressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information
from the server. (CVE-2011-2730)

Note: Manual action is required to apply the fix for CVE-2011-2730. If your
system has deployed applications which use Spring framework, the context
parameter "springJspExpressionSupport" must be set to "false" to mitigate
this flaw, for example, in the application's web.xml file. This will
prevent the double-evaluation of EL expressions that led to this flaw.

An XSS flaw allowed a remote attacker to perform an XSS attack against
victims using the JMX Console. (CVE-2011-4575)

SecurityAssociation.getCredential() returned the previous credential if
no security context was provided. Depending on the deployed applications,
this could possibly allow a remote attacker to hijack the credentials of a
previously-authenticated user. (CVE-2012-3370)

A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
arrays (hashes) in JRuby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
inputs to a JRuby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, the Murmur
hash function has been replaced with the Perl hash function.
(CVE-2012-5370)

Note: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of
the scripting\_chain quickstart example application. The CVE-2012-5370 flaw
is not exposed unless the version of JRuby shipped with that quickstart is
used by a deployed, custom application.

Configuring the JMX Invoker to restrict access to users with specific
roles did not actually restrict access, allowing remote attackers with
valid JMX Invoker credentials to perform JMX operations accessible to
roles they are not a member of. (CVE-2012-5478)

twiddle.sh accepted credentials as command line arguments, allowing local
users to view them via a process listing. (CVE-2009-5066)

NonManagedConnectionFactory logged the username and password in plain text
when an exception was thrown. This could lead to the exposure of
authentication credentials if local users had permissions to read the log
file. (CVE-2012-0034)

The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow
unauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security
interceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation
of this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently
disabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context
of the user running the JBoss server. (CVE-2012-0874)

CallerIdentityLoginModule retained the password from the previous call if a
null password was provided. In non-default configurations this could
possibly lead to a remote attacker hijacking a previously-authenticated
user's session. (CVE-2012-3369)

Red Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum
for reporting CVE-2011-2487, and Tyler Krpata for reporting CVE-2011-4575.
The CVE-2012-3370 and CVE-2012-3369 issues were discovered by Carlo de Wolf
of Red Hat; CVE-2012-5478 was discovered by Derek Horton of Red Hat; and
CVE-2012-0874 was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response
Team.

Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
SOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
configuration files, and so on).

All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red
Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform
5.3.1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=880671#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-27 15:04:21 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the JRuby's Murmur hash function implementation. A specially-crafted set of keys could trigger Murmur hash function collisions, which degrade hash table items insert performance by changing hash table operations complexity from an expected/average O(n) to the worst case O(n^2). Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using equivalent substrings.  As various web application frameworks for Ruby automatically pre-fill certain arrays with data from the HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters) for Ruby web applications, a remote attacker could use this flaw to make the Ruby interpreter use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with a large number parameters which hash to the same value.  A different vulnerability than [CVE-2011-4838](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4838).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=880671#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-27 15:04:21 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the JRuby's Murmur hash function implementation. A specially-crafted set of keys could trigger Murmur hash function collisions, which degrade hash table items insert performance by changing hash table operations complexity from an expected/average O(n) to the worst case O(n^2). Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using equivalent substrings.  As various web application frameworks for Ruby automatically pre-fill certain arrays with data from the HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters) for Ruby web applications, a remote attacker could use this flaw to make the Ruby interpreter use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with a large number parameters which hash to the same value.  A different vulnerability than [CVE-2011-4838](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4838).

**oCERT-2012-001 multiple implementations denial-of-service via MurmurHash algorithm collision**

**Description**:

A variety of programming languages suffer from a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition against storage functions of key/value pairs in hash data structures,
the condition can be leveraged by exploiting predictable collisions in the
underlying hashing algorithms.

The issue is similar to the one reported in [oCERT-2011-003](ocert-2011-003.html)
and concerns the MurmurHash algorithm family. The condition for predictable collisions in the hashing functions has
been reported for the following language implementations:
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) (MurmurHash2),
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) (MurmurHash2),
[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/) (MurmurHash3),
[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase) (MurmurHash),
[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) (MurmurHash).
In the case of Java OpenJDK the hash function affected by the reported
issue is not enabled by default, the default function is however reported vulnerable to
[oCERT-2011-003](ocert-2011-003.html).

**Affected version**:

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) < 1.9.3-p327

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) < 1.7.1

[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), all versions

[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase) <= 7

[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) <= 7

**Fixed version**:

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) >= 1.9.3-p327

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) >= 1.7.1

[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), N/A (see References for patch commited to development branch)

[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase), N/A

[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net), N/A
