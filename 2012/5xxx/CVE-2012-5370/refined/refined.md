{
  "CVE-2012-5370": {
    "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative arrays (hashes) in JRuby. An attacker able to supply a large number of inputs to a JRuby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, the Murmur hash function has been replaced with the Perl hash function.",
    "Root cause": "The Murmur hash function used in JRuby was susceptible to collisions, allowing an attacker to cause excessive CPU usage.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Hash collision vulnerability in Murmur hash function implementation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can cause a JRuby application to consume excessive CPU time by exploiting hash collisions, potentially rendering the application unavailable.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacker can supply a large number of inputs via HTTP POST request parameters or other means to trigger hash collisions."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted inputs to the affected JRuby application, for example through web application interfaces."
