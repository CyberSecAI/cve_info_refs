  "CVE-2012-5519": {
    "description": "CUPS 1.4.4, when running in certain Linux distributions such as Debian GNU/Linux, stores the web interface administrator key in /var/run/cups/certs/0 using certain permissions, which allows local users in the lpadmin group to read or write arbitrary files as root by leveraging the web interface.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The CUPS web interface allows users in the `lpadmin` group to modify the CUPS configuration file which includes setting log file paths. The web interface administrator key is stored in a file that is readable by the `lpadmin` group, allowing them to authenticate to the web interface without a password.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure storage of the web interface administrator key.",
        "Insufficient access control on the CUPS configuration file through the web interface.",
        "CUPS web interface runs as root."
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation from the `lpadmin` group to root. Attackers can read or write arbitrary files as root by leveraging the web interface.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access via the CUPS web interface.",
          "Modification of the CUPS config file."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user and a member of the lpadmin group."
    },
    "affected_packages": [
      "cups 1.4.4 (and prior)",
        "cups 1.5.3 (and prior)",
         "cups 1.6.1 (and prior)"
    ],
      "patch_details":{
        "debian_patch": "The fix in Debian involves modifying CUPS to use two configuration files: `cupsd.conf` for web-configurable settings and `cups-files.conf` for settings only modifiable by root. A script moves sensitive configuration parameters from `cupsd.conf` to `cups-files.conf` during the upgrade process.",
        "ubuntu_patch": "Ubuntu disables the ability to edit the cupsd.conf file from the web interface by hiding the edit option.",
        "redhat_patch": "Red Hat introduced the \"ConfigurationChangeRestriction\" directive to limit remote changes to the cupsd.conf, and sets the default to 'all' to block remote config changes."
