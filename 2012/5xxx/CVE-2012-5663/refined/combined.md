### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Message-ID: <20121221110558.GA7583@netbsd.org>
Date: Fri, 21 Dec 2012 11:05:58 +0000
From: David Holland <dholland-oss-security@...bsd.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Isearch insecure temporary files

NetBSD pkgsrc ships an old text search package called Isearch, which I
found tonight (in the course of making it compile with a modernish C++
compiler) to contain garden-variety /tmp races.

Does anyone else ship it? I don't think this is worth a CVE unless
someone does; the package appears to be dead upstream.

<http://gnats.netbsd.org/47360> for reference; the relevant portions of
the patches cited follow.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

n/a
>Description:

The isearch package (textproc/isearch) uses the tempnam() function in
three different places to choose the name of a temporary file it
writes later on into a publicly-writable area (/tmp). Needless to say,
this is insecure.

>How-To-Repeat:

Observe the linker warnings, search the source.

>Fix:

Update to at least isearch-1.47.01nb1, or take the relevant portions
of these patches:

   patches/patch-doctype_anzmeta.cxx
   patches/patch-doctype_fgdc.cxx
   patches/patch-src_marc.cxx

Yeah.

Looking at that thread (which I didn't see at the time because I no
longer have time to follow this list much) I think I'd agree that the
CVE system itself is the wrong scheme, not only for its own reasons
but also because it doesn't reach the right targets.

Most people prefer to get software from some kind of package
collection, both because it's easier and because such collections are
to some extent curated. CVEs work well in this environment; they go
out to the collection maintainers, packages in the collections get
tagged, end users can crosscheck their installed package lists against
CVE databases, etc.

However, the kind of software we're talking about (dead upstream,
inherently suspect, not really worth auditing or fixing) tends to get
kicked out of these collections and forgotten. So when/if end users
are exposed, it's likely to be because they downloaded something from
some random place and installed it in /usr/local/bin, or worse,
untarred it in ~httpd, and then possibly forgot entirely about it.
There isn't much of a pipeline for getting CVE information to them,
and they aren't in general likely to think to crosscheck the CVE
database. (Nor, with some of these old things, is it always entirely
clear if the item they're looking at is the same as the one the CVE
database is talking about.)

All of these problems also apply to any new scheme someone sets up;
what I'm suggesting is that the existing CVE infrastructure is not
necessarily that much of an advantage.

That said, I don't know what the answer is. We have quite a number of
packages in pkgsrc that are dead (or comatose) upstream and that we're
effectively maintaining ourselves because they require only minor
attention or someone considers them worthwhile. I've often thought it
would be helpful to have some kind of wider community for dealing with
these, not just for security but also for general patches and bug
fixes. This could also serve as a clearinghouse for deciding which
things should be declared dead. But you can't create such a community
by waving a wand.

Will do, thanks.

This is similar to <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q4/142>

Ideally we need some way to mark software as dead/unsafe/don't use. I
don't know what the answer is though (does someone maintain a
blacklist? who decides? etc.).

Yeah that's pretty classic /tmp vulns. Please use CVE-2012-5663 for
this issue.
