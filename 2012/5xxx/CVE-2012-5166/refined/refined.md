  "CVE-2012-5166": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way BIND handled certain combinations of resource records. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a recursive resolver, or an authoritative server in certain configurations, to lockup.",
    "affected_products": [
      "AIX",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux",
      "openSUSE",
      "Debian",
      "Slackware",
       "Mac OS X"
    ],
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "A flaw in the way BIND handled certain combinations of resource records.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of resource records leading to a server lockup"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The nameserver will not respond to queries or control commands, and normal functionality can only be restored by restarting named.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely against recursive servers or authoritative servers.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft and send specially crafted DNS data. For recursive servers, the attacker can induce them to query for records provided by an authoritative server. For authoritative servers, the attacker needs to load the specific combination of resource records either from a file, zone transfer, or dynamic update."
