| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=864273#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-09 03:17:11 UTC  ``` A flaw in ISC BIND was reported where, if specific combinations of RDATA are loaded into a nameserver, either via cache or an authoritative zone, a subsequent query for a related record will cause named to lock up.  This vulnerability can be exploited remotely against recursive servers by inducing them to query for records provided by an authoritative server. It affects authoritative servers if one of the combinations of resource records is loaded from file, provided via zone transfer, or submitted to a zone via dynamic update.  Once bind becomes locked-up due to the above issue, it will not respond to queries or control commands. Normal functionality can only be restored by restarting named.  Workaround: Setting the option 'minimal-responses' to 'yes' will prevent the lockup.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=864273#c4)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-09 22:43:25 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00801>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=864273#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-09 22:44:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 624300](attachment.cgi?id=624300&action=diff "diff of bind-9.6-ESV-R7-P3 to P4") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=624300&action=edit "diff of bind-9.6-ESV-R7-P3 to P4") diff of bind-9.6-ESV-R7-P3 to P4  The relevant bits of the diff between versions with this changelog entry:  3383.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: bind97 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1364)

## Topic

Updated bind97 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a
resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with
DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

A flaw was found in the way BIND handled certain combinations of resource
records. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a recursive
resolver, or an authoritative server in certain configurations, to lockup.
(CVE-2012-5166)

Users of bind97 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct this issue. After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named)
will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5166
Debian Bug     : 690118

It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, hangs while constructing
the additional section of a DNS reply, when certain combinations of
resource records are present.  This vulnerability affects both
recursive and authoritative servers.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze8.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

## What we do:

* [Compliance and certification](/en/solutions/compliance-approach "Red Hat compliance and certification")
* [Incident response](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerability-management)
* [Hybrid cloud security](/en/solutions/hybrid-cloud-security-approach "Red Hat’s approach to hybrid cloud security")

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Note: Xerox recommends that customers evaluate their security needs periodically and if they need Security
patches  to  address  the  above  CVE  issues,  schedule  an  activity  with  their  Xerox  Service  team  to  install  this
announced Security Patch Cluster.

Applicability

These Security updates are intended for Xerox printer products running one of the FFPS 73.C0.41 or 73.B3.61
SPAR software releases.  This Security patch update has only been tested on these software releases and it is
recommended that they be installed on these FFPS software release versions.  They have not been tested with
the FFPS 73.B0.73 and 73.A3.31 software releases.

The  Xerox  CSE/Analyst  is  provided  a  tool  (accessible  from  CFO  Web  site)  that  enables  them  to  confirm  the
currently  installed  FFPS  software  release,  Security  Patch  Cluster,  and  Java  Software  version.    When  this
Security update has been installed on the FFPS system, this script will output the following:

FFPS Release Version:
FFPS Patch Cluster:
Java Version:

8.0_SP-3 (82.C5.24.86)
January 2013
Java 6 Update 37

Patch Install Methods

The  install  of  these  Security  patches  must  be  performed  by  the  Xerox  Customer  Service  Engineer  (CSE)  or
Analyst.  The customer process to obtain this Security update is to call the Xerox support number to request
the service.

Xerox strives to deliver these critical Security patch updates in a timely manner.  They are available from the
Xerox  Support  organization,  and  can  be  delivered  electronically  over  the  Internet  to  the  FFPS  system  via  a
GUI tool called the FFPS Update Manager. The other method of delivery is an FTP transfer to the FFPS system
or  writing  the  patch  cluster  to  DVD/USB  media.    A  more  detailed  description  of  the  methods  used  by  the
CSE/Analyst to install the Security patches is as follows:

FFPS Update Manager GUI

Once the Security patches are ready for customer delivery they are made available from the Xerox Edge
Host  and  Download  servers.    The  CSE/Analyst  uses  the  Update  Manager  GUI  on  the  FFPS  system  to
download  and  install  the  Security  patches  over  the  Internet.    When  the  Xerox  server  is  checked  for
updates  from  FFPS  Update  Manager,  this  Security  patch  update  is  listed  as  “January  2013  Security
Patch Cluster (FFPS v8)”.

This requires that the FFPS system be configured with the customer proxy information to gain Security
patch  update  access  from  the  Xerox  servers.    The  connection  is  initiated  by  the  FFPS  system  and  the
Xerox  servers  do  not  have  access  to  the  customer  network.    The  Xerox  server  and  FFPS  system  both
authenticate  each  other  before  a  data  transfer  can  be  successfully  established  between  the  two  end
points.

Hard Disk, DVD/USB Media

Once  the  Security  patch  updates  are  ready  for  customer  delivery  they  are  made  available  on  the  CFO
Web site.  The CSE/Analyst can download and prepare for the install by writing the Security patch update
into a well-known directory on the FFPS system, or on DVD/USB media.  The FFPS Security Patch Cluster is
delivered  as  an  ISO  image  and  ZIP  archive  file  to  provide  the  Xerox  Service  Representative  options  to
choose an install method.  Once the patch cluster has been prepared on media an install script can be run
to perform the install.  The install  script accepts an argument that identifies the media that contains a
copy of the FFPS Security Patch Cluster.  (E.g., # installSecPatches.sh [ disk | dvd | usb ]).

Important: The install of this Security patch update can fail if the archive file containing the patches is
corrupted from file transfer or writing to DVD media.  There have been reported install failures when the
archive  file  written  on  DVD  media  was  corrupt.    The  Security  patch  update  could  be  corrupted  when
writing  to  media  by  particular  DVD  burn  applications  writing  on  some  DVD  media  types.    It  is  very
important that the Security patch archive written onto the DVD install media be verified with the original
archive file that was written to DVD.

The Security patch cluster is delivered as a ZIP and an ISO file.  The file size and check sum of these files
on Windows and Solaris are as follows:

Security Patch File

Windows Size (Kb)

Solaris Size (bytes)

Solaris Checksum

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip

1,663,512

1,703,435,583

54151  3327023

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.iso

1,615,862

1,703,794,688

13849  3327724

The Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip listed on the DVD media can be verified by comparing it to
the original archive file size and checksum.  Copy this archive to a location on the FFPS system and type
‘sum  Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip’  from  a  terminal  window.    The  checksum  value  should  be
‘54151    3327023’,  and  this  validates  the  correct  January  2013  Security  Patch  Cluster  is  written  on  the
DVD.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: bind security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1363)

## Topic

Updated bind packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a
resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with
DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

A flaw was found in the way BIND handled certain combinations of resource
records. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a recursive
resolver, or an authoritative server in certain configurations, to lockup.
(CVE-2012-5166)

Users of bind are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct this issue. After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named)
will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1365)

## Topic

Updated bind packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

A flaw was found in the way BIND handled resource records with a large
RDATA value. A malicious owner of a DNS domain could use this flaw to
create specially-crafted DNS resource records, that would cause a recursive
resolver or secondary server to exit unexpectedly with an assertion
failure. (CVE-2012-4244)

A flaw was found in the way BIND handled certain combinations of resource
records. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a recursive
resolver, or an authoritative server in certain configurations, to lockup.
(CVE-2012-5166)

Users of bind are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named)
will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
