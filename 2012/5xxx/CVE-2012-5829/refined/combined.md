How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new packages introduced

regressions in cookies handling and the User Agent string. This update fixes

the problem.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

# USN-1681-4: Firefox regression

5 February 2013

USN-1681-1 introduced a regression in Firefox.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-1681-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. Due to an upstream regression,

Firefox suffered from instabilities when accessing some websites. This

update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill

Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O'Callahan, Jesse Ruderman,

and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0769](/security/CVE-2013-0769), [CVE-2013-0749](/security/CVE-2013-0749), [CVE-2013-0770](/security/CVE-2013-0770))

Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in

Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0760](/security/CVE-2013-0760), [CVE-2013-0761](/security/CVE-2013-0761), [CVE-2013-0762](/security/CVE-2013-0762),

[CVE-2013-0763](/security/CVE-2013-0763), [CVE-2013-0766](/security/CVE-2013-0766), [CVE-2013-0767](/security/CVE-2013-0767), [CVE-2013-0771](/security/CVE-2013-0771), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829))

A stack buffer was discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this

to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0768](/security/CVE-2013-0768))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that Firefox did not always properly display URL

values in the address bar. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct

URL spoofing and phishing attacks. ([CVE-2013-0759](/security/CVE-2013-0759))

Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox did not properly handle HTML tables

with a large number of columns and column groups. If the user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0744](/security/CVE-2013-0744))

Jerry Baker discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle

threading when performing downloads over SSL connections. An attacker could

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.

([CVE-2013-0764](/security/CVE-2013-0764))

Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered flaws in the Javacript engine of

Firefox. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash,

or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0745](/security/CVE-2013-0745), [CVE-2013-0746](/security/CVE-2013-0746))

Jesse Ruderman discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled plugins. If a

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker

could exploit this to bypass security protections to conduct clickjacking

attacks. ([CVE-2013-0747](/security/CVE-2013-0747))

Jesse Ruderman discovered an information leak in Firefox. An attacker could

exploit this to reveal memory address layout which could help in bypassing

ASLR protections. ([CVE-2013-0748](/security/CVE-2013-0748))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Javascript engine, leading to a

heap-based buffer overflow. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0750](/security/CVE-2013-0750))

Sviatoslav Chagaev discovered that Firefox did not properly handle XBL

files with multiple XML bindings with SVG content. An attacker could cause

a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0752](/security/CVE-2013-0752))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered two flaws to gain access to privileged chrome

functions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0757](/security/CVE-2013-0757), [CVE-2013-0758](/security/CVE-2013-0758))

Several use-after-free issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0753](/security/CVE-2013-0753), [CVE-2013-0754](/security/CVE-2013-0754), [CVE-2013-0755](/security/CVE-2013-0755), [CVE-2013-0756](/security/CVE-2013-0756))

Two intermediate CA certificates were mis-issued by the TURKTRUST

certificate authority. If a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2013-0743](/security/CVE-2013-0743))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=877634#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-11-17 12:05:16 UTC  ``` Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting five additional use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow flaws introduced during Firefox development that were fixed before general release.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-105.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.

## Details

Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill

Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O'Callahan, Jesse Ruderman,

and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0769](/security/CVE-2013-0769), [CVE-2013-0749](/security/CVE-2013-0749), [CVE-2013-0770](/security/CVE-2013-0770))

Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in

Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0760](/security/CVE-2013-0760), [CVE-2013-0761](/security/CVE-2013-0761), [CVE-2013-0762](/security/CVE-2013-0762),

[CVE-2013-0763](/security/CVE-2013-0763), [CVE-2013-0766](/security/CVE-2013-0766), [CVE-2013-0767](/security/CVE-2013-0767), [CVE-2013-0771](/security/CVE-2013-0771), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829))

A stack buffer was discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this

to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0768](/security/CVE-2013-0768))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that Firefox did not always properly display URL

values in the address bar. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct

URL spoofing and phishing attacks. ([CVE-2013-0759](/security/CVE-2013-0759))

Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox did not properly handle HTML tables

with a large number of columns and column groups. If the user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0744](/security/CVE-2013-0744))

Jerry Baker discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle

threading when performing downloads over SSL connections. An attacker could

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.

([CVE-2013-0764](/security/CVE-2013-0764))

Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered flaws in the Javacript engine of

Firefox. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash,

or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0745](/security/CVE-2013-0745), [CVE-2013-0746](/security/CVE-2013-0746))

Jesse Ruderman discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled plugins. If a

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker

could exploit this to bypass security protections to conduct clickjacking

attacks. ([CVE-2013-0747](/security/CVE-2013-0747))

Jesse Ruderman discovered an information leak in Firefox. An attacker could

exploit this to reveal memory address layout which could help in bypassing

ASLR protections. ([CVE-2013-0748](/security/CVE-2013-0748))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Javascript engine, leading to a

heap-based buffer overflow. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0750](/security/CVE-2013-0750))

Sviatoslav Chagaev discovered that Firefox did not properly handle XBL

files with multiple XML bindings with SVG content. An attacker could cause

a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0752](/security/CVE-2013-0752))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered two flaws to gain access to privileged chrome

functions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0757](/security/CVE-2013-0757), [CVE-2013-0758](/security/CVE-2013-0758))

Several use-after-free issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0753](/security/CVE-2013-0753), [CVE-2013-0754](/security/CVE-2013-0754), [CVE-2013-0755](/security/CVE-2013-0755), [CVE-2013-0756](/security/CVE-2013-0756))

Two intermediate CA certificates were mis-issued by the TURKTRUST

certificate authority. If a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2013-0743](/security/CVE-2013-0743))

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 10.0.11 ESR
security release, which fixes various bugs and security
issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-106: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series critically
rated of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and memory
corruption issues in shipped software. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
execution. We would also like to thank miaubiz for
reporting two additional use-after-free and memory
corruption issues introduced during Firefox development
that have been fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o use-after-free when loading html file on osx
(CVE-2012-5830) o Mesa crashes on certain texImage2D calls
involving level>0 (CVE-2012-5833) o integer overflow,
invalid write w/webgl bufferdata (CVE-2012-5835)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o crash in copyTexImage2D with image dimensions
too large for given level (CVE-2012-5838)
\*
MFSA 2012-105: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer
overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped
software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting five additional
use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow
flaws introduced during Firefox development that have been
fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditorState::PrepareEditor (CVE-2012-4214) o
Heap-use-after-free in
nsPlaintextEditor::FireClipboardEvent (CVE-2012-4215) o
Heap-use-after-free in gfxFont::GetFontEntry
(CVE-2012-4216) o Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWindow::OnExposeEvent (CVE-2012-5829) o
heap-buffer-overflow in
gfxShapedWord::CompressedGlyph::IsClusterStart o
CVE-2012-5839 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditorState::PrepareEditor (CVE-2012-5840)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o Heap-use-after-free in XPCWrappedNative::Mark
(CVE-2012-4212) o Heap-use-after-free in
nsEditor::FindNextLeafNode (CVE-2012-4213) o
Heap-use-after-free in nsViewManager::ProcessPendingUpdates
(CVE-2012-4217) o Heap-use-after-free
BuildTextRunsScanner::BreakSink::SetBreaks (CVE-2012-4218)
\*
MFSA 2012-104 / CVE-2012-4210: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a maliciously crafted
stylesheet is inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and
CSS can run in a chrome privileged context without being
properly sanitized first. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-103 / CVE-2012-4209: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a
frame whose name attribute's value is set to "top". This
can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-102 / CVE-2012-5837: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that when script is entered into
the Developer Toolbar, it runs in a chrome privileged
context. This allows for arbitrary code execution or
cross-site scripting (XSS) if a user can be convinced to
paste malicious code into the Developer Toolbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-101 / CVE-2012-4207: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa found when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is
used for text, the "~" character will destroy another
character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in
HZ-GB-2312.
\*
MFSA 2012-100 / CVE-2012-5841: Mozilla developer
Bobby Holley reported that security wrappers filter at the
time of property access, but once a function is returned,
the caller can use this function without further security
checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for
write actions on objects when only read actions should be
properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-99 / CVE-2012-4208: Mozilla developer Peter
Van der Beken discovered that same-origin XrayWrappers
expose chrome-only properties even when not in a chrome
compartment. This can allow web content to get properties
of DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-98 / CVE-2012-4206: Security researcher
Robert Kugler reported that when a specifically named DLL
file on a Windows computer is placed in the default
downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the Firefox
installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In
circumstances where the installer is run by an
administrator privileged account, this allows for the
downloaded DLL file to be run with administrator
privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution from
a privileged account.
\*
MFSA 2012-97 / CVE-2012-4205: Mozilla developer Gabor
Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created
within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the
sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running
untrusted code in a sandbox.
\*
MFSA 2012-96 / CVE-2012-4204: Security researcher
Scott Bell of Security-Assessment.com used the Address
Sanitizer tool to discover a memory corruption in
str\_unescape in the Javascript engine. This could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-95 / CVE-2012-4203: Security researcher
kakzz.ng@gmail.com reported that if a javascript: URL is
selected from the list of Firefox "new tab" page, the
script will inherit the privileges of the privileged "new
tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally
installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a
bookmark of a malicious javascript: URL.
\*
MFSA 2012-94 / CVE-2012-5836: Security researcher
Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining SVG text on a
path with the setting of CSS properties could lead to a
potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-93 / CVE-2012-4201: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that if code executed by
the evalInSandbox function sets location.href, it can get
the wrong subject principal for the URL check, ignoring the
sandbox's Javascript context and gaining the context of
evalInSandbox object. This can lead to malicious web
content being able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack or stealing a copy of a local file if the user has
installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-92 / CVE-2012-4202: Security researcher
Atte Kettunen from OUSPG used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format
images. This issue is potentially exploitable and could
lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-91: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2013:0049-1
Rating: important
References: #796628 #796895
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP4
SLE SDK 10 SP4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to the 10.0.12ESR release.
\*
MFSA 2013-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
o Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats
Palmgren, and Chiaki Ishikawa reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10, Firefox
ESR 17, and Firefox 17. ( CVE-2013-0769
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0769>
\*
MFSA 2013-02: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series critically rated of use-after-free, out of bounds
read, and buffer overflow issues using the Address
Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for
reporting three additional user-after-free and out of
bounds read flaws introduced during Firefox development
that were fixed before general release.
The following issue was fixed in Firefox 18:
o Global-buffer-overflow in
CharDistributionAnalysis::HandleOneChar (CVE-2013-0760
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0760>

...
> )

The following issues were fixed in Firefox 18, ESR
17.0.1, and ESR 10.0.12:
o Heap-use-after-free in imgRequest::OnStopFrame
(CVE-2013-0762
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0762>

...
> ) o Heap-use-after-free in ~nsHTMLEditRules
> (CVE-2013-0766
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0766>
> ) o Out of bounds read in
> nsSVGPathElement::GetPathLengthScale ( CVE-2013-0767
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0767>
> )

The following issues were fixed in Firefox 18 and ESR
17.0.1:
o Heap-use-after-free in
mozilla::TrackUnionStream::EndTrack ( CVE-2013-0761
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0761>

...
> ) o Heap-use-after-free in Mesa, triggerable by resizing
> a WebGL canvas (CVE-2013-0763
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0763>
> ) o Heap-buffer-overflow in
> gfxTextRun::ShrinkToLigatureBoundaries (CVE-2013-0771
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0771>
> )

...
> )

The following issue was fixed in Firefox 18 and in
the earlier ESR 10.0.11 release:
o Heap-buffer-overflow in nsWindow::OnExposeEvent
(CVE-2012-5829
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5829>
\*
MFSA 2013-03: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a buffer overflow in
Canvas when specific bad height and width values were given
through HTML. This could lead to a potentially exploitable
crash. (CVE-2013-0768
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0768>

...
> )

Miaubiz also found a potentially exploitable crash
when 2D and 3D content was mixed which was introduced
during Firefox development and fixed before general release.
\*
MFSA 2013-04: Security researcher Masato Kinugawa
found a flaw in which the displayed URL values within the
addressbar can be spoofed by a page during loading. This
allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can
spoof the identify of another site. ( CVE-2013-0759
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0759>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-05: Using the Address Sanitizer tool,
security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG discovered
that the combination of large numbers of columns and column
groups in a table could cause the array containing the
columns during rendering to overwrite itself. This can lead
to a user-after-free causing a potentially exploitable
crash. ( CVE-2013-0744
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0744>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-06: Mozilla developer Wesley Johnston
reported that when there are two or more iframes on the
same HTML page, an iframe is able to see the touch events
and their targets that occur within the other iframes on
the page. If the iframes are from the same origin, they can
also access the properties and methods of the targets of
other iframes but same-origin policy (SOP) restricts access
across domains. This allows for information leakage and
possibilities for cross-site scripting (XSS) if another
vulnerability can be used to get around SOP restrictions.
(CVE-2013-0751
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0751>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-07: Mozilla community member Jerry Baker
reported a crashing issue found through Thunderbird when
downloading messages over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
connection. This was caused by a bug in the networking code
assuming that secure connections were entirely handled on
the socket transport thread when they can occur on a
variety of threads. The resulting crash was potentially
exploitable. (CVE-2013-0764
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0764>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-08: Mozilla developer Olli Pettay
discovered that the AutoWrapperChanger class fails to keep
some javascript objects alive during garbage collection.
This can lead to an exploitable crash allowing for
arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2013-0745
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0745>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-09: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky
reported reported a problem where jsval-returning
quickstubs fail to wrap their return values, causing a
compartment mismatch. This mismatch can cause garbage
collection to occur incorrectly and lead to a potentially
exploitable crash. (CVE-2013-0746
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0746>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-10: Mozilla security researcher Jesse
Ruderman reported that events in the plugin handler can be
manipulated by web content to bypass same-origin policy
(SOP) restrictions. This can allow for clickjacking on
malicious web pages. (CVE-2013-0747
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0747>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-11: Mozilla security researcher Jesse
Ruderman discovered that using the toString function of XBL
objects can lead to inappropriate information leakage by
revealing the address space layout instead of just the ID
of the object. This layout information could potentially be
used to bypass ASLR and other security protections.
(CVE-2013-0748
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0748>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-12: Security researcher pa\_kt reported a
flaw via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that an integer
overflow is possible when calculating the length for a
Javascript string concatenation, which is then used for
memory allocation. This results in a buffer overflow,
leading to a potentially exploitable memory corruption.
(CVE-2013-0750
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0750>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-13: Security researcher Sviatoslav Chagaev
reported that when using an XBL file containing multiple
XML bindings with SVG content, a memory corruption can
occur. In concern with remote XUL, this can lead to an
exploitable crash. (CVE-2013-0752
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0752>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-14: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that it is possible to change the prototype of an
object and bypass Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) to gain
access to chrome privileged functions. This could allow for
arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2013-0757
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0757>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-15: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that it is possible to open a chrome privileged
web page through plugin objects through interaction with
SVG elements. This could allow for arbitrary code
execution. (CVE-2013-0758
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0758>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-16: Security researcher regenrecht
reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a
use-after-free in XMLSerializer by the exposing of
serializeToStream to web content. This can lead to
arbitrary code execution when exploited. (CVE-2013-0753
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0753>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-17: Security researcher regenrecht
reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a
use-after-free within the ListenerManager when garbage
collection is forced after data in listener objects have
been allocated in some circumstances. This results in a
use-after-free which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
(CVE-2013-0754
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0754>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-18: Security researcher regenrecht
reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a
use-after-free using the domDoc pointer within Vibrate
library. This can lead to arbitrary code execution when
exploited. (CVE-2013-0755
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0755>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-19: Security researcher regenrecht
reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a garbage
collection flaw in Javascript Proxy objects. This can lead
to a use-after-free leading to arbitrary code execution.
(CVE-2013-0756
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0756>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-20: Google reported to Mozilla that
TURKTRUST, a certificate authority in Mozilla's root
program, had mis-issued two intermediate certificates to
customers. The issue was not specific to Firefox but there
was evidence that one of the certificates was used for
man-in-the-middle (MITM) traffic management of domain names
that the customer did not legitimately own or control. This
issue was resolved by revoking the trust for these specific
mis-issued certificates. (CVE-2013-0743

Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4201 CVE-2012-4207 CVE-2012-4216 CVE-2012-5829
                 CVE-2012-5842

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.

CVE-2012-4201
  The evalInSandbox implementation uses an incorrect context during
  the handling of JavaScript code that sets the location.href
  property, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks or read arbitrary files by leveraging a
  sandboxed add-on.

CVE-2012-4207
  The HZ-GB-2312 character-set implementation does not properly handle
  a ~ (tilde) character in proximity to a chunk delimiter, which
  allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks via a crafted document.

CVE-2012-4216
  Use-after-free vulnerability in the gfxFont::GetFontEntry function
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
  of service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-5829
  Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsWindow::OnExposeEvent function could
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-5842
  Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine could
  allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
  corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
  code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze15.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

## Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-105

## Use-after-free and buffer overflow issues found using Address Sanitizer

Announced
November 20, 2012
Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 17
* Firefox ESR 10.0.11
* SeaMonkey 2.14
* Thunderbird 17
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.11

### Description

Security researcher **Abhishek Arya** (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting five additional use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow flaws introduced during Firefox development that were fixed before general release.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

## Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript

enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript

code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit

this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same

domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Thunderbird to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious E-Mail, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript

enabled, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript

code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. If JavaScript were

enabled, an attacker could use this to bypass intended chrome-only

restrictions on reading DOM object properties via a crafted web site.

([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript

enabled, a remote attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had

JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and

had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute

arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or

arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214),

[CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829), [CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840),

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled,

an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830), [CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-02

## Use-after-free and buffer overflow issues found using Address Sanitizer

Announced
January 8, 2013
Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 18
* Firefox ESR 10.0.11
* Firefox ESR 10.0.12
* Firefox ESR 17.0.2
* SeaMonkey 2.15
* Thunderbird 17.0.2
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.12
* Thunderbird ESR 17.0.2

### Description

Security researcher **Abhishek Arya** (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a series critically rated of use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting three additional user-after-free and out of bounds read flaws introduced during Firefox development that were fixed before general release.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

An update that fixes 29 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes three new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to the 10.0.12ESR release.
\*
MFSA 2013-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
o Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats
Palmgren, and Chiaki Ishikawa reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10, Firefox
ESR 17, and Firefox 17. ( CVE-2013-0769
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0769>
\*
MFSA 2013-02: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series critically rated of use-after-free, out of bounds
read, and buffer overflow issues using the Address
Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for
reporting three additional user-after-free and out of
bounds read flaws introduced during Firefox development
that were fixed before general release.
The following issue was fixed in Firefox 18:
o Global-buffer-overflow in
CharDistributionAnalysis::HandleOneChar (CVE-2013-0760
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0760>

...
> )

The following issues were fixed in Firefox 18, ESR
17.0.1, and ESR 10.0.12:
o Heap-use-after-free in imgRequest::OnStopFrame
(CVE-2013-0762
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0762>

...
> ) o Heap-use-after-free in ~nsHTMLEditRules
> (CVE-2013-0766
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0766>
> ) o Out of bounds read in
> nsSVGPathElement::GetPathLengthScale ( CVE-2013-0767
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0767>
> )

The following issues were fixed in Firefox 18 and ESR
17.0.1:
o Heap-use-after-free in
mozilla::TrackUnionStream::EndTrack ( CVE-2013-0761
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0761>

...
> ) o Heap-use-after-free in Mesa, triggerable by resizing
> a WebGL canvas (CVE-2013-0763
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0763>
> ) o Heap-buffer-overflow in
> gfxTextRun::ShrinkToLigatureBoundaries (CVE-2013-0771
> <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0771>
> )

...
> )

The following issue was fixed in Firefox 18 and in
the earlier ESR 10.0.11 release:
o Heap-buffer-overflow in nsWindow::OnExposeEvent
(CVE-2012-5829
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5829>
\*
MFSA 2013-03: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a buffer overflow in
Canvas when specific bad height and width values were given
through HTML. This could lead to a potentially exploitable
crash. (CVE-2013-0768
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0768>

...
> )

Miaubiz also found a potentially exploitable crash
when 2D and 3D content was mixed which was introduced
during Firefox development and fixed before general release.
\*
MFSA 2013-04: Security researcher Masato Kinugawa
found a flaw in which the displayed URL values within the
addressbar can be spoofed by a page during loading. This
allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can
spoof the identify of another site. ( CVE-2013-0759
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0759>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-05: Using the Address Sanitizer tool,
security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG discovered
that the combination of large numbers of columns and column
groups in a table could cause the array containing the
columns during rendering to overwrite itself. This can lead
to a user-after-free causing a potentially exploitable
crash. ( CVE-2013-0744
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0744>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-06: Mozilla developer Wesley Johnston
reported that when there are two or more iframes on the
same HTML page, an iframe is able to see the touch events
and their targets that occur within the other iframes on
the page. If the iframes are from the same origin, they can
also access the properties and methods of the targets of
other iframes but same-origin policy (SOP) restricts access
across domains. This allows for information leakage and
possibilities for cross-site scripting (XSS) if another
vulnerability can be used to get around SOP restrictions.
(CVE-2013-0751
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0751>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-07: Mozilla community member Jerry Baker
reported a crashing issue found through Thunderbird when
downloading messages over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
connection. This was caused by a bug in the networking code
assuming that secure connections were entirely handled on
the socket transport thread when they can occur on a
variety of threads. The resulting crash was potentially
exploitable. (CVE-2013-0764
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0764>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-08: Mozilla developer Olli Pettay
discovered that the AutoWrapperChanger class fails to keep
some javascript objects alive during garbage collection.
This can lead to an exploitable crash allowing for
arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2013-0745
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0745>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-09: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky
reported reported a problem where jsval-returning
quickstubs fail to wrap their return values, causing a
compartment mismatch. This mismatch can cause garbage
collection to occur incorrectly and lead to a potentially
exploitable crash. (CVE-2013-0746
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0746>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-10: Mozilla security researcher Jesse
Ruderman reported that events in the plugin handler can be
manipulated by web content to bypass same-origin policy
(SOP) restrictions. This can allow for clickjacking on
malicious web pages. (CVE-2013-0747
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0747>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-11: Mozilla security researcher Jesse
Ruderman discovered that using the toString function of XBL
objects can lead to inappropriate information leakage by
revealing the address space layout instead of just the ID
of the object. This layout information could potentially be
used to bypass ASLR and other security protections.
(CVE-2013-0748
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0748>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-12: Security researcher pa\_kt reported a
flaw via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that an integer
overflow is possible when calculating the length for a
Javascript string concatenation, which is then used for
memory allocation. This results in a buffer overflow,
leading to a potentially exploitable memory corruption.
(CVE-2013-0750
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0750>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-13: Security researcher Sviatoslav Chagaev
reported that when using an XBL file containing multiple
XML bindings with SVG content, a memory corruption can
occur. In concern with remote XUL, this can lead to an
exploitable crash. (CVE-2013-0752
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0752>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-14: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that it is possible to change the prototype of an
object and bypass Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) to gain
access to chrome privileged functions. This could allow for
arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2013-0757
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0757>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-15: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that it is possible to open a chrome privileged
web page through plugin objects through interaction with
SVG elements. This could allow for arbitrary code
execution. (CVE-2013-0758
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0758>

...
> )

\*
MFSA 2013-16: Security researcher regenrecht
reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a
use-after-free in XMLSerializer by the exposing of
serializeToStream to web content. This can lead to
arbitrary code execution when exploited. (CVE-2013-0753
<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0753>

...
> )

\*

MFSA 2013-20: Google reported to Mozilla that
TURKTRUST, a certificate authority in Mozilla's root
program, had mis-issued two intermediate certificates to
customers. The issue was not specific to Firefox but there
was evidence that one of the certificates was used for
man-in-the-middle (MITM) traffic management of domain names
that the customer did not legitimately own or control. This
issue was resolved by revoking the trust for these specific
mis-issued certificates. (CVE-2013-0743

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

                 CVE-2012-5842
Debian Bug     :

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Iceweasel, the Debian web browser
based on Mozilla Firefox:

CVE-2012-5829

  Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsWindow::OnExposeEvent function could
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-5842

  Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine could allow remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application
  crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-4207

  The HZ-GB-2312 character-set implementation does not properly handle a ~
  (tilde) character in proximity to a chunk delimiter, which allows remote
  attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted
  document.

CVE-2012-4201

  The evalInSandbox implementation uses an incorrect context during the
  handling of JavaScript code that sets the location.href property, which
  allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or read
  arbitrary files by leveraging a sandboxed add-on.

CVE-2012-4216

  Use-after-free vulnerability in the gfxFont::GetFontEntry function allows
  remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
  memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.16-20.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11esr-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the
XUL Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2012-4214, CVE-2012-4215, CVE-2012-4216, CVE-2012-5829,
CVE-2012-5830, CVE-2012-5833, CVE-2012-5835, CVE-2012-5839, CVE-2012-5840,
CVE-2012-5842)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled GIF (Graphics
Interchange Format) images. A web page containing a malicious GIF image
could cause Firefox to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-4202)

A flaw was found in the way the Style Inspector tool in Firefox handled
certain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Running the tool (Tools -> Web
Developer -> Inspect) on malicious CSS could result in the execution of
HTML and CSS content with chrome privileges. (CVE-2012-4210)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded the HZ-GB-2312 character
encoding. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
run JavaScript code with the permissions of a different website.
(CVE-2012-4207)

A flaw was found in the location object implementation in Firefox.
Malicious content could possibly use this flaw to allow restricted content
to be loaded by plug-ins. (CVE-2012-4209)

A flaw was found in the way cross-origin wrappers were implemented.
Malicious content could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting
attacks. (CVE-2012-5841)

A flaw was found in the evalInSandbox implementation in Firefox. Malicious
content could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting attacks.
(CVE-2012-4201)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.11 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Abhishek Arya, miaubiz, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew
McCreight, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Atte Kettunen, Mariusz Mlynski, Masato
Kinugawa, Bobby Holley, and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 as the original reporters of these
issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.11 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Reproduces on trunk. Testcase reproduces extremely flakily if i first run firefox with a clean profile (and testcase path on cmd line), then close the firefox completely, and then rerun it again with testcase. Trying to get a minimized testcase. The second-time need might be coming from this line in the testcase
InstallTrigger.install({
"Unsigned XPI": "<http://example.com/browser/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/test/xpinstall/unsigned.xpi>"

If we're mis-calculating a tranlucency area I don't know why it would be flaky, but it does looks like if ASan caught it reading that byte it will turn around and write an updated value to it in the next statement. If it's just an off-by-one might be pretty hard to exploit. Would a different testcase result in a different offset?
It's in a loop at that point though, so maybe ASan stopped it at the first byte but it would have kept going. We'll have to debug and see.Whiteboard: [asan]

We could get into trouble here if mBounds is changed during PaintWindow, but I thought that couldn't happen now with viewmanager.refresh-driver-painting.enabled.
There could also be problems if the child window mBounds were greater than the toplevel window mBounds. I don't know how that would happen.

Due to InstallTrigger.install on unsigned xpi, I do see a small child window overhanging from the navigation bar that says "The add-on could not be downloaded because of a connection failure with xyz.com" (non-existent url). I think that is the root cause [its width is shortened when the download fails]. Reduction is going pretty poorly atm since it depends on the timing of that window.

Sorry, the unminimized test is a fuzzer testcase, so won't be able to attach it here. I am trying to get a somewhat minimized testcase, and will attach as soon as i get one.
Regarding Karl point - "There could also be problems if the child window mBounds were greater than the toplevel window mBounds. I don't know how that would happen.", this part is easily reproducible by a reduced testcase (enclosing, run from cmd-line). you can just resize the top level window manually (shorten width) and the child window about the error will remain outside bounds.

It looks like widget bounds can change during PaintWindow if ForcedRepaint().
I assume we could make widget handle that, or perhaps we should also consider doing forced repaints from WillPaintWindow instead of PaintWindow.
Matt is considering changing painting from the refresh driver to WillPaintWindow for performance reasons, but that would also address this.

[delay shape mask update from resize to expose](attachment.cgi?id=663277&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=792305&attachment=663277)

Some initial clean-up.
There is no need to ResizeTransparencyBitmap in NativeResize because we'll get
to OnSizeAllocate from the size-allocate signal anyway.
There is not much point calling ResizeTransparencyBitmap in OnSizeAllocate
because the only difference it might make to appearance would be to make the
unpainted part of the widget visible. Better to wait until that part is ready
to paint. In that theme, this changes initialization of the mask on resize
to transparent.Assignee: nobody → karltStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Good news: security crash is fixed. Bad news: there is an ugly black enclosing rectangle visible on the edges. Let me add the screen shot. Just to reiterate on reproducer steps. Start with clean new profile and testcase on cmd-line, close firefox completely and then start firefox with that same profile and again testcase on cmd-line.

Thanks. I don't see the black part here.
Can you tell me which window manager is running, please?
Does disabling or enabling compositing change the behavior?
Does the black rectangle disappear immediately on closing the window.

Yes if I close this child window (the window that says "this add-on downloaded from example.com...."), then the blck rectangle disappears.

Yes. I can see, thanks.

I can't reproduce the same behavior here with metacity, but I do see other glitches, similar to [bug 635897](/show_bug.cgi?id=635897 "VERIFIED FIXED - Weird rendering of the Identity information and Edit bookmark widgets with metacity compositor"), but more significant more often.
Rather than add more Shape code to work around this, [bug 408284](/show_bug.cgi?id=408284 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Linux/Gnome] Support for translucent windows on Linux") is almost there, so I'll see about getting that completed.
> > Does disabling or enabling compositing change the behavior?

That's harder to explain. I see no glitches with compositing disabled. (The window manager is not involved with these override-redirect windows when compositing is disabled.)
If there is an X server interaction issue, then that needs a different solution.

The nsWindow.cpp code was designed to expect widget resizes during WillPaintWindow but not during PaintWindow.
[Bug 539356](/show_bug.cgi?id=539356 "RESOLVED FIXED - Replace Invalidate() calls in reflow with display list analysis") changed things to so that ProcessPendingUpdates() can sometimes call ProcessPendingUpdates() during nsViewManager::Refresh() during PaintWindow.
That allows resizes to happen during PaintWindow() and is what I expect enabled this bug to be triggered.
That change landed for the 17 branch, but is disabled on that branch through viewmanager.refresh-driver-painting.enabled.
Before that change, going back as far as 15 at least, Refresh() does not call ProcessPendingUpdates(). The nsAutoScriptBlocker in Refresh() should prevent any nested event loops that may allow resizes.
So we should be fine on 15 to 17.
On esr10, things are different again:
In nsViewManager::DispatchEvent(), NS\_PAINT (the equivalent of PaintWindow) will ProcessPendingUpdates() if mHasPendingUpdates is set. I think that is fine because ProcessPendingUpdates() will do nothing because the resizes have already happened during NS\_WILL\_PAINT.
However, NS\_PAINT can cause CallWillPaintOnObservers to be called. I'm not familiar with the didResize logic there, but that can cause nsPresShell::FlushPendingNotifications() to be called, during which anything can happen. I doubt that that function iterates until there are no more events pending, and so calling CallWillPaintOnObservers on NS\_WILL\_PAINT does not ensure that nothing happens on NS\_PAINT AFAIK.
We can backport [attachment 663278](/attachment.cgi?id=663278 "don't update mask bits outside the mask") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=663278&action=edit "don't update mask bits outside the mask") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=663278&action=diff "don't update mask bits outside the mask") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=792305&attachment=663278) to esr10.

don't update mask bits outside the mask
[Security approval request comment]
How easily can the security issue be deduced from the patch?
The presence of potential overflow bug can be deduced from the patch, but the conditions to generate the overflow are much more complicated.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Same answer as above. The do not indicate how content might affect the size of a chrome popup. There are also timing requirements, and on esr10 these include having to influence the chrome popup during an event dispatched because of reflow.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
esr10
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 539356](/show_bug.cgi?id=539356 "RESOLVED FIXED - Replace Invalidate() calls in reflow with display list analysis") for 18. Bug may have existed long before esr10.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Same key patch applies as intended with fuzz. The cleanup patches, which include risk, are not required.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely; see quote in [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=792305#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow in nsWindow::OnExposeEvent").
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
Fixes potential heap buffer overflow security risk.

(In reply to Karl Tomlinson (:karlt) from [comment #26](/show_bug.cgi?id=792305#c26 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow in nsWindow::OnExposeEvent"))

and that needs to be during a paint event on the chrome popup. I'm not sure content will get to run then, so this may not be exploitable on esr10.
But the patch is safe.

I'm confused. How do we have a bug that affects ESR10 but does not affect 17, which came after ESR10's fork?

See [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=792305#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow in nsWindow::OnExposeEvent"). The painting code has changed several times. The bug on ESR10 is a theoretical bug. The testcase here may not reproduce on ESR10, but there is the potential for other triggers.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [ubufox](/security/cves?package=ubufox) - Ubuntu Firefox specific configuration defaults and apt support

## Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides an

updated ubufox package for use with the latest Firefox.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-4214,
CVE-2012-4215, CVE-2012-4216, CVE-2012-5829, CVE-2012-5830, CVE-2012-5833,
CVE-2012-5835, CVE-2012-5839, CVE-2012-5840, CVE-2012-5842)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled GIF
(Graphics Interchange Format) images. Content containing a malicious GIF
image could cause Thunderbird to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-4202)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded the HZ-GB-2312 character
encoding. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to run JavaScript code
with the permissions of different content. (CVE-2012-4207)

A flaw was found in the location object implementation in Thunderbird.
Malicious content could possibly use this flaw to allow restricted content
to be loaded by plug-ins. (CVE-2012-4209)

A flaw was found in the way cross-origin wrappers were implemented.
Malicious content could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting
attacks. (CVE-2012-5841)

A flaw was found in the evalInSandbox implementation in Thunderbird.
Malicious content could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting
attacks. (CVE-2012-4201)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Abhishek Arya, miaubiz, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew
McCreight, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Atte Kettunen, Masato Kinugawa, Mariusz
Mlynski, Bobby Holley, and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 as the original reporters of
these issues.

Note: All issues except CVE-2012-4202 cannot be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.11 ESR, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Details

USN-1681-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Thunderbird.

Original advisory details:

Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill

Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O'Callahan, Jesse Ruderman,

and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0769](/security/CVE-2013-0769), [CVE-2013-0749](/security/CVE-2013-0749), [CVE-2013-0770](/security/CVE-2013-0770))

Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in

Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0760](/security/CVE-2013-0760), [CVE-2013-0761](/security/CVE-2013-0761), [CVE-2013-0762](/security/CVE-2013-0762),

[CVE-2013-0763](/security/CVE-2013-0763), [CVE-2013-0766](/security/CVE-2013-0766), [CVE-2013-0767](/security/CVE-2013-0767), [CVE-2013-0771](/security/CVE-2013-0771), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829))

A stack buffer was discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this

to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0768](/security/CVE-2013-0768))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that Firefox did not always properly display URL

values in the address bar. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct

URL spoofing and phishing attacks. ([CVE-2013-0759](/security/CVE-2013-0759))

Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox did not properly handle HTML tables

with a large number of columns and column groups. If the user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0744](/security/CVE-2013-0744))

Jerry Baker discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle

threading when performing downloads over SSL connections. An attacker could

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.

([CVE-2013-0764](/security/CVE-2013-0764))

Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered flaws in the Javacript engine of

Firefox. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash,

or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0745](/security/CVE-2013-0745), [CVE-2013-0746](/security/CVE-2013-0746))

Jesse Ruderman discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled plugins. If a

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker

could exploit this to bypass security protections to conduct clickjacking

attacks. ([CVE-2013-0747](/security/CVE-2013-0747))

Jesse Ruderman discovered an information leak in Firefox. An attacker could

exploit this to reveal memory address layout which could help in bypassing

ASLR protections. ([CVE-2013-0748](/security/CVE-2013-0748))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Javascript engine, leading to a

heap-based buffer overflow. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0750](/security/CVE-2013-0750))

Sviatoslav Chagaev discovered that Firefox did not properly handle XBL

files with multiple XML bindings with SVG content. An attacker could cause

a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0752](/security/CVE-2013-0752))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered two flaws to gain access to privileged chrome

functions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0757](/security/CVE-2013-0757), [CVE-2013-0758](/security/CVE-2013-0758))

Several use-after-free issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly

exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0753](/security/CVE-2013-0753), [CVE-2013-0754](/security/CVE-2013-0754), [CVE-2013-0755](/security/CVE-2013-0755), [CVE-2013-0756](/security/CVE-2013-0756))

Two intermediate CA certificates were mis-issued by the TURKTRUST

certificate authority. If a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2013-0743](/security/CVE-2013-0743))
