Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `allowmodule.py` file in Plone. The specific nature of the flaw isn't detailed, but the provided context associates it with CWE-749, which relates to "Exposed Dangerous Method or Function". This suggests that `allowmodule.py` exposes a function or method that can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-749 (Exposed Dangerous Method or Function):** The core vulnerability is that a method or function within `allowmodule.py` is exposed in a way that allows unauthorized or malicious use. This could involve direct access to a method that should be restricted, or improper usage of the function leading to unintended consequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The specific impact is not fully detailed in the provided content. However, since CWE-749 relates to dangerous functions, potential impacts could include:
    - Code Execution: if the exposed method allows it, it might be possible to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    - Data Manipulation: if the exposed method has write or modification access to data, an attacker could alter or delete critical data.
    - Privilege Escalation: if the exposed method is supposed to be used by an administrator, attackers could abuse it to escalate privileges.
    - Denial of Service: attackers could invoke the function in a way to cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.
     
**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is likely through the web interface to the Plone application, by calling the exposed method or function in the `allowmodule.py`.
    - The specific way to trigger the vulnerability is not specified, but is likely through crafted requests or other interaction with the Plone application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker would likely need to be able to make requests to the Plone web application. 
-   Whether authentication is needed or not is not specified. The nature of CWE-749 may suggest this issue is exploitable by any users and even anonymous users as it exposes a dangerous method.
-   Specific knowledge of the Plone system is needed to exploit this vulnerability, because the attacker needs to invoke the correct method.

**Summary:**
CVE-2012-5487 in Plone is caused by an exposed dangerous method within the `allowmodule.py` file, which could allow an attacker to perform malicious actions. The full impact is not specified but could include code execution, data manipulation, privilege escalation, or denial of service, with the attack vector likely being through crafted web requests.
