Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2012-5565:

*   **Vulnerability:** Obscure XSS issue when uploading attachments.
*   **Affected Component:** IMP (Internet Mail Program) within Horde Groupware Webmail Edition.
*   **Versions Affected:** Prior to IMP v5.0.24-git and Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 4.0.9
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in the dynamic view when uploading a file. The filename, taken from the browser's local filesystem, is not properly sanitized, leading to potential XSS if the filename contains HTML.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker needs to create a file with a malicious filename containing HTML and upload it through the IMP interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a filesystem that supports angled brackets in filenames (Windows does not; Linux does). The attacker must upload the file through the IMP interface.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
*   **Fix:** The issue is resolved by escaping the filename using `escapeHTML()` before displaying it.
