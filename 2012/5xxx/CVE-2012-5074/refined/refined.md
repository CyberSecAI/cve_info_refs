Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The default Java security properties configuration did not restrict access to the `com.sun.org.glassfish.external` and `com.sun.org.glassfish.gmbal` packages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate access control: The Java security manager failed to restrict access to specific Glassfish packages, allowing untrusted code to potentially bypass sandbox restrictions.
- Missing package restrictions: The `java.security` file did not list the aforementioned packages as restricted, leading to a security loophole.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An untrusted Java application or applet could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Bypass Java sandbox restrictions, gaining unauthorized access to system resources or perform actions that are normally forbidden.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through untrusted Java applications or applets. These can be delivered via web pages, malicious software downloads, or other methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary Java code on a system running the vulnerable Java version. This could involve tricking a user into running a malicious Java applet or application.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed by updating the `java.security` file to restrict access to the affected packages.
- Patches for this vulnerability were included in various releases of OpenJDK and Oracle JDK.
- This CVE is related to CVE-2012-5076, which covers the same vulnerability in different packages.
- The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in Oracle's October 2012 Critical Patch Update.
