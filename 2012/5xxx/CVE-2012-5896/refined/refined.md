Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an uninitialized pointer within the `AnnotateX.dll` ActiveX control, a component of Quest InTrust 10.4.x. Specifically, when the `Add()` method is invoked, it dereferences an uninitialized pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Pointer:** The core issue is the use of an uninitialized pointer within the ActiveX control when calling the Add() method.
*   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerable ActiveX control is marked as "Safe for Scripting" and "Safe for Initialization" which allows it to be scripted remotely in Internet Explorer. This expands the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can control the memory address the uninitialized pointer points to, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. By controlling the `eax` register, an attacker can redirect execution to attacker-controlled memory via techniques such as heap spraying.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious web page.
*   **ActiveX Control Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a webpage with a script that interacts with the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, requiring only the victim to browse a malicious page.
*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious HTML page.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to visit a malicious web page in Internet Explorer, which has the vulnerable ActiveX control installed, for the exploit to execute.
*   **Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable ActiveX control's CLSID and method names (`Add()`), along with how to craft a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML page that demonstrates the vulnerability using JavaScript. The PoC utilizes heap spraying techniques to ensure a specific address for the uninitialized pointer to jump to.
*   The advisory also mentions the specific CLSID ({EF600D71-358F-11D1-8FD4-00AA00BD091C}) and ProgID (AnnotationX.AnnList.1) for the vulnerable ActiveX control.
*   The binary path for the vulnerable dll is located at `C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\SOFTWA~1\ANNOTA~1.DLL`
*   The issue exists because the `Add()` method does not validate user-supplied memory before jumping to it, causing it to call an arbitrary address, controllable by an attacker.
