Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper HTML escaping in the output of phpMyAdmin when displaying names of Triggers, Procedures, and Events. Specifically, when creating or modifying these database objects with crafted names, the names were not being escaped before being rendered in the HTML, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically names of Triggers, Procedures, and Events, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page that are executed by other users.
-   **Improper Output Handling:** The core weakness is the failure to escape HTML characters when displaying the names of the database objects. This allows the browser to interpret the injected script rather than displaying it as plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the web page, potentially leading to:
    -   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    -   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or stored in the application.
    -   **Defacement:** Modifying the visual presentation of the web page.
    -   **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the names of Triggers, Procedures, or Events when creating or modifying them via the phpMyAdmin interface.
-   **User Interaction:** The XSS is triggered when a user views a page containing these objects with the malicious names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated phpMyAdmin user with the ability to create or modify Triggers, Procedures, or Events.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft the malicious input.

**Mitigation:**

- The issue was fixed by applying HTML escaping to the output of the names of Triggers, Procedures, and Events.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The severity of this vulnerability was considered "non-critical" because it required a user to enter crafted values.
-   Affected versions include phpMyAdmin 3.5.x. The fix is available in version 3.5.3 and newer.
