Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the OM Maximenu module for Drupal, which allows for injection of arbitrary HTML, JavaScript, and PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient sanitization in:
    *   Link titles.
    *   "Path Query" and "Anchor" parameters in links.
    *   Maximenu title.
    *   Vocabulary names.

2.  **Arbitrary PHP Execution:**  Users with "Administer OM Maximenu" permissions can execute arbitrary PHP code by enabling the "Title has PHP" option, which is not documented, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts to:
    *   Perform client-side attacks (e.g., drive-by downloads).
    *   Steal user credentials.
    *   Compromise other Drupal accounts.
*   **Arbitrary PHP Execution:** Attackers with "Administer OM Maximenu" permissions can:
    *   Compromise the host operating system.
    *   Steal sensitive data from the Drupal database.
    *   Escalate privileges.
    *   Damage the site and/or host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Injecting malicious code through various input fields within the OM Maximenu module's configuration interface.
*   **PHP Execution:** Exploiting the undocumented "Title has PHP" option available to users with "Administer OM Maximenu" permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** Requires the attacker to interact with the OM Maximenu configuration interface, though the exact method is not always clear from the information provided. This might require the attacker to have an account with specific permissions to edit the menus or simply be an unauthenticated user interacting with affected public facing features.
*   **PHP Execution:** Requires an attacker to have a Drupal user account with "Administer OM Maximenu" permissions, which can be obtained via compromised credentials or privilege escalation.
