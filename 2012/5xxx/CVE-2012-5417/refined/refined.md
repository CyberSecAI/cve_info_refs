Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2012-5417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way Cisco Prime DCNM handles RMI (Remote Method Invocation) transactions. Specifically, it does not properly restrict access to the RMI registry, which is accessible via TCP ports 1099 or 9099, depending on the DCNM version.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution:** The primary weakness is that an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the RMI service to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the Cisco Prime DCNM application.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability exists because the RMI registry port is not properly protected, allowing unauthorized access.
*  **JBoss Configuration:** The Metasploit framework has an exploit module (Jboss\_maindeployer) that exploits a JBoss configuration related to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the application. This means commands are executed as the "System" user on Windows and as "root" on Linux.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  The ability to execute arbitrary commands with system-level privileges can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, system manipulation, and denial-of-service.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a complete impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   **RMI Registry Port:** The attacker connects to the RMI registry port (TCP 1099 or 9099) to initiate the malicious transaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the affected Cisco Prime DCNM server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require authentication. An unauthenticated attacker can directly exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both the DCNM-SAN Server and DCNM-LAN Server components of Cisco Prime DCNM.
*  The Metasploit framework has an exploit module that can exploit the vulnerability.
*   Mitigation involves restricting access to the RMI registry port to only legitimate devices and additional mitigations outlined in the advisory's companion document.
* The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager release 6.1(2).
