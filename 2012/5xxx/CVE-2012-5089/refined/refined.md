  "CVE-2012-5089": {
    "vulnerability_description": "Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Beans, Swing, and JMX components in OpenJDK, allowing an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnectionImpl` class, which did not properly perform access control checks.  An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to disclose sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient access control checks in the `javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnectionImpl` class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
       "Sandbox bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the Java sandbox restrictions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, sensitive information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Untrusted Java applications or applets",
      "Network attacks to vulnerable services"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute untrusted Java code."
