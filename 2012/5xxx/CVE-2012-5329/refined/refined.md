Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stack-based buffer overflow in the `APPE` command of the TYPSoft FTP Server version 1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** Sending a crafted string as part of the `APPE` command causes a buffer overflow, specifically in the SEH (Structured Exception Handler). The exploit code shows that a buffer of `A../ + A * 100` is sent as part of the `APPE` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow leads to a crash of the server, rendering it unresponsive. This is a denial of service as stated in the EDB description ("Target should be unresponsive!"). 

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is conducted remotely by sending a malicious `APPE` command to the vulnerable FTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the target FTP server.
- **FTP Server Access:** The attacker needs access to a running instance of the vulnerable TYPSoft FTP Server 1.1. The exploit notes that valid credentials are required, but that anonymous logins are enabled by default.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit script confirms the vulnerability using the APPE command.
- The server crashes due to a SEH overflow, which can be further exploited to achieve code execution.
- The exploit code is written in Python and is specific to the Windows platform.
