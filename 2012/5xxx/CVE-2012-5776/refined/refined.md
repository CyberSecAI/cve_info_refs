Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "extra_" parameters within the `main/auth/profile.php` file of Dokeos 2.1.1. Specifically, these parameters are not sanitized before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the "extra_" parameters. This injected script will then be executed by the browsers of other users viewing the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution in User Browsers:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run malicious code within the browsers of other users.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies, giving them access to the victim's account.
- **Data Theft:** The injected code could be used to steal sensitive information from the user or the application.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could alter the content of the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulated HTTP Requests:** An attacker can send crafted requests to `main/auth/profile.php`, including malicious scripts within the "extra_" parameters.
- **Targeting Users:** An attacker can use social engineering or other means to trick victims into clicking a manipulated link, injecting their browser with malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know that the "extra_" parameters are vulnerable and how to exploit them.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable page with malicious payloads.
- **No special user privilege is required** an attacker can be anyone able to reach the vulnerable page.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes a code excerpt from `main/admin/registration_step3.php`. While not directly related to the vulnerability itself (as it's in a different file), it is an example of how Dokeos handles some "extra_" user input, providing context.
- The CVE assignment was specifically for XSS issues related to "extra_" parameters in `main/auth/profile.php` of Dokeos 2.1.1.
