The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities in the "Case YVS Image Gallery" application, but only one is assigned a CVE. The vulnerability assigned to CVE-2012-1564 is an XSS issue. The other is a PHP code injection issue.

Here's a breakdown of the PHP code injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `install.php` script opens `../functions/db_connect.php` and writes to it without proper input validation of variables. This allows for PHP code injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP code injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into the `db_connect.php` file. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application by executing arbitrary code on the server.
*  **Attack vectors:** By submitting malicious input through variables when `install.php` writes to `db_connect.php`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to access and trigger the install script which is meant to be deleted after installation.

The second vulnerability discussed is:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of input validation in `create_album.php` allows for stored XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed by other users when they view the main page.
*   **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts through the `create_album.php` script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator of the application to inject XSS code, but the XSS code can be triggered when normal users view the mainpage.

The content notes that the PHP code injection vulnerability is considered a configuration issue because the install guide states that `install.php` should be deleted after installation. Because the file should not be present in a deployed system, this is not assigned a CVE. However, the XSS vulnerability is assigned CVE-2012-1564.

Based on this, the provided content does **not** relate to CVE-2012-5304.
