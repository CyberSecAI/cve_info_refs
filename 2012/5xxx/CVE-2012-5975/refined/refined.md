  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A bug exists in the SSH USERAUTH CHANGE REQUEST routines of SSH Tectia, which are intended for password changes. By sending a password change request before authentication, an attacker can bypass the authentication process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication bypass vulnerability in SSH Tectia's password change request routine."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with a valid username can log in without a password and potentially gain root access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the SSH protocol.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable SSH Tectia server and a valid username."
