Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5361:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2012-5361, as it is explicitly mentioned in the Microsoft Vulnerability Research Advisory MSVR12-017, along with CVE-2012-5359 and CVE-2012-5360. The advisory states that these CVEs are related to vulnerabilities discovered in FFmpeg's libavcodec.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerabilities stem from how FFmpeg's `libavcodec` parses specifically crafted ASF, QT, and WMV files.
*   This improper parsing leads to memory corruption issues within `libavcodec`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to incorrect parsing of file formats. This corruption can be exploited by attackers to overwrite or manipulate data in memory.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the system.
*   **System Control:** With full control, an attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new user accounts with full administrative rights.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted ASF, QT, or WMV file.
*   **Email Attachments:** These malicious files can be sent as email attachments.
*   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers could host websites that contain these specially crafted files or inject such files into compromised websites or user-generated content areas.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file. This could involve using social engineering through emails, instant messages, or other means.
*   **File Hosting:** The attacker may need a platform to host malicious files, such as a web server.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation of the vulnerability requires user interaction in the form of opening a specially crafted file. It cannot be done automatically without user action.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that FFmpeg has addressed these vulnerabilities in their software, urging users to update to the latest version.
*   Older versions of FFmpeg (0.10 and earlier) are affected, while versions 0.11 and 1.0 are not.
*   The Microsoft advisory is based on coordinated disclosure with FFmpeg.
*   The vulnerability does not exploit via email automatically.
*   Impact is based on the level of permissions held by the user opening the file, with users with fewer permissions being less impacted than those with administrative permissions.
