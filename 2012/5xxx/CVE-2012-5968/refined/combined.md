## Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#871148

Original Release Date: 2012-12-13 | Last Revised: 2012-12-13

---

### Overview

The Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device contains multiple vulnerabilities which could allow an attacker to perform administrative functions on the device.

### Description

| The Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device contains multiple vulnerabilities which could allow an attacker to perform administrative functions on the device.  1. The Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device Admin Authority Authentication bypass ([HWNSIRT-2012-1029](http://www.huawei.com/en/security/psirt/security-bulletins/security-advisories/hw-198239.htm)) CVE-2012-5968:Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device fails to check the login status of admin sessions, which leads to an attacker being able to bypass the admin authority authentication allowing them access to the protected files and configure the device. This can lead to the leak and tampering of the non-shared user data and the disclosure of the session ID, allowing the attacker to configure the devices by authentication with the session ID which can be obtained by the attacker. The vendor has stated this vulnerability can only be exploited on the LAN side, and it cannot be exploited to launch attacks on the WAN side.2. The Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device directory traversal ([HWNSIRT-2012-1030](http://www.huawei.com/en/security/psirt/security-bulletins/security-advisories/hw-198239.htm)) CVE-2012-5969:Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device fails to restrict the access path of the files. Attackers can modify the path of the files manually giving them access to the system files to further access the protected files or write arbitrary files into the system. Before the system interface is invoked, the web server module of Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device fails to strictly check the validity of the file names and the paths of the files which are contained in the request packets on the LAN side. The vendor has stated this vulnerability can only be exploited on the LAN side, and it cannot be exploited to launch attacks on the WAN side.Examples requests:curl -X GET  [http://192.168.1.1/sdcard/..%2f..%2f](http://192.168.1.1/sdcard/../../)"$1"curl -X POST -d "action=request\_page&page=sms.asp&req\_page=../../../$1" <http://192.168.1.1/en/sms.cgi>3. The Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device null pointer denial-of-service ([HWNSIRT-2012-1031](http://www.huawei.com/en/security/psirt/security-bulletins/security-advisories/hw-198240.htm)) CVE-2012-5970:Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device crashes when analyzing specific packets (such as the packets which are sent by vulnerability scanning software), the HTTP request segment in the packets can cause a character string pointer in the code (the return value of the character matching function and the character string pointer used in the login authentication function) to be set to Null, which the underling code fails to check whether the value of this pointer is null or not, causing a segment fault, which can cause the devices to become unable to respond and fail to function normally. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with access to the Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device web interface can conduct multiple attacks, which could be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**  The vendor has released updated versions of the device software. For update information see [Huawei-SA-20121124-1-E585](http://www.huawei.com/en/security/psirt/security-bulletins/security-advisories/hw-198239.htm) and [Huawei-SA-20121203-1-E585](http://www.huawei.com/en/security/psirt/security-bulletins/security-advisories/hw-198240.htm). |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |

# Security Advisory-Web server vulnerabilities on Huawei E585 pocket Wi-Fi 2 device

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20121124-1-E585
* Initial Release Date:
  Nov 24, 2012
* Last Release Date:
  Nov 24, 2012

Summary

HUAWEI E585 Wireless Modem is the terminal which can realize the high-speed wireless network access. The access is realized by the connection between USB interfaces and PCs or by the connection between WiFi and many wireless devices. In the network coverage area of HSPA/UMTS or EDGE/GPRS/GSM, users can enjoy the applications of wireless network access, short message communication, and sending and receiving emails. The current product has the following vulnerabilities:

1. E585 has not checked the login status of admin in the session , which leads to the vulnerability that can bypass the admin authority authentication to allow attackers to access the protected files and configure the devices (Vulnerability ID: HWNSIRT-2012-1029)；

2. Before the system interface is invoked, the web server module of E585 has not strictly checked the validity of the file names and the paths of the files, which can allow attackers access the protected files on E585 through directory traversal and arbitrarily modify the files (Vulnerability ID: HWNSIRT-2012-1030).

Currently, workarounds are available and are detailed below.

V100R001C09B102SP02

V100R001C323B505SP03

Impact

1. The authority authentication of admin has been bypassed.

Attackers can bypass the admin authority authentication to directly access the E585 file system through the local connection. After having obtained the devices, the illegal users can exploit this vulnerability to access the non-shared user data and the device data and can set the access configuration which may lead to the leak or tampering of the user privacy data and the device data (such as the session ID);

2. Devices do not restrict the access path.

The system has not strictly checked the validity of the file names and the paths of the files in the request command. Once this vulnerability has been exploited, attackers can access the internal partitions of devices through directory traversal or even modify the files inside the system partitions which can make the devices fail to be started normally or used.

The above-mentioned vulnerability can not be exploited from the WAN side.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSSv2 scoring system

(<http://www.first.org/cvss/>).

1. HWNSIRT-2012-1029:

CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.8(AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

CVSS v2 Temporal Score: 3.9 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)

2. HWNSIRT-2012-1030:

CVSS v2 Base Score: 8.3(AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

CVSS v2 Temporal Score: 6.9 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)

Technique Details

Prerequisite of exploiting vulnerabilities to launch attacks:

It is necessary to connect to the devices through the WiFi or USB interface on the LAN side and to deliver commands to the devices by using the command line tool.

Vulnerability Description:

HWNSIRT-2012-1029

As E585 has not authenticated strictly the user login authority on the server, illegal users can bypass the admin authority authentication to access the protected files directly and modify the files. This can lead to the leak and tampering of the non-shared user data and the disclosure of the session ID, so attackers can configure the devices without the session ID authentication.

This vulnerability can only be exploited on the LAN side, and it cannot be exploited to launch attacks on the WAN side.

HWNSIRT-2012-1030

As the devices have not restricted the access path of the files, when users modify the path of the files manually, they can access the system files to further access the protected files or write arbitrary files into the system.

Before the system interface is invoked, the web server module of E585 has not strictly check the validity of the file names and the paths of the files which are contained in the request packets on the LAN side. So attackers can modify the file names and the paths of the files in the request packets manually, and access the protected files of the system or write arbitrary files into the system through directory traversal.

This vulnerability can only be exploited on the LAN side, and it cannot be exploited to launch attacks on the WAN side.

Temporary Fix

None

Software Versions and Fixes

Solution:

1.  Add the authentication mechanism for the scenarios of access through command lines to the web server of E585 so as to check the login status of users;

2. Add the operation of the filtering of the access paths to files in the web server of E585, check whether there is the directory traversal symbol in the packets or not. If there is the directory traversal symbol, ignore the access. Check the file names which are accessed for matching to prevent users from accessing the files which they do not have the authority to access.

FAQs

Question 1: Can someone else exploit these vulnerabilities remotely through networks to perform the read-write operation on the board files?

Answer: These vulnerabilities can only be exploited through the local area network to make the read-write operation on the board files possible. The remote users cannot access the Web Server of board, so they cannot exploit these vulnerabilities remotely through networks.

Question 2: How can I identify the software version of the E585 I am using?

Answer: Locally access the address of the board gateway (the default address is 192.168.1.1) to log in to the Web UI. And check the software version under the menu of Advanced settings->System->Version.
