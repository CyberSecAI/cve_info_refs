Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5343:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of filtering on the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable in the `/admin/login.php` script of Limny CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Because the `PHP_SELF` variable is not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the URI, which will then be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Stealing cookies, which may allow session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the page displayed to the user.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, if they are logged in.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a crafted URL. The attacker must entice the victim to click on the malicious link (e.g., via a phishing campaign or by injecting the malicious link in a forum/comment section). The malicious code is embedded into the URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs and to convince the user to click on them. The attacker does not need to have any privileged access to the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko Krstic from Zero Science Lab.
- The affected version is Limny 3.0.1.
- The vendor released version 3.0.2 to address the issue.
- The vulnerability was tested on a Windows XP SP3 environment running Apache 2.2.21, MySQL 5.5.16, and PHP 5.3.8.
- The proof of concept (PoC) is provided in a separate file (`limny_xss.txt`).
