Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-5452

**Root Cause:** The Subrion CMS 2.2.1 suffers from multiple stored and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These occur because user-supplied input passed via various parameters to multiple scripts is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Multiple XSS vulnerabilities:** Both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist within the application
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input before displaying it back to the user, making it vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within the user's browser in the context of the affected site. This can be used to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user
    *   Deface the website

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **POST Injection:**  The vulnerabilities are triggered by POST requests to the vulnerable scripts with malicious code embedded in specific parameters.
*   **Remote exploitation:** An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the affected Subrion CMS instance.
*   The attacker does not need any privileged access to the system.
