Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5360:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2012-5360` as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in FFmpeg.
   - The Microsoft advisory MSVR12-017 also confirms the relevance, stating, "Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported these vulnerabilities to and coordinated with FFmpeg to ensure remediation of these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities have been assigned CVE entries CVE-2012-5359, CVE-2012-5360, and CVE-2012-5361, respectively, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list."

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from how FFmpeg's `libavcodec` library parses ASF, QT, and WMV files.
   - Specifically, a parsing error in `libavcodec` leads to memory corruption.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
    - Memory corruption vulnerability.
    - Improper parsing of ASF, QT, and WMV file formats.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the security context of the user running FFmpeg.
    - **Privilege escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system.
    - **System compromise:** This can allow an attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**5. Attack vectors:**
    - **File-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted file (ASF, QT, or WMV).
    - **Email/IM:** Social engineering techniques, such as sending malicious attachments via email or instant messaging, can be used to deliver the crafted files.
    - **Web-based:** Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content could contain specially crafted files to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Crafted file creation:** The attacker must be able to create malicious ASF, QT, or WMV files that trigger the vulnerability in `libavcodec`.
    - **User interaction:** The attacker needs to induce the user to open the malicious file (e.g., through social engineering).
    - **No direct network access:** Direct network access to the vulnerable system is not required; the attacker relies on user action.

**7. Additional notes:**
    - The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Microsoft Vulnerability Research.
    - FFmpeg has released updates to address the vulnerabilities in versions 0.11 and 1.0.
    - User accounts with fewer privileges are less susceptible to complete system takeover.
