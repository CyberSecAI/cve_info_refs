Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Peel Shopping 2.8 and 2.9, as described in the exploit:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Location 1:**  `http://localhost/peel/index.php/achat/recherche.php?motclef=[Xss Here ]&action=Rechercher` - This indicates that the `motclef` parameter in the `recherche.php` script is vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Location 2:** `http://localhost/peel/index.php/[XSS]` - This suggests that the application is vulnerable to XSS through a path traversal or similar mechanism within `index.php`.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Location:** `http://localhost/peel/administrer/tva.php?mode=modif&id=[SQL]` -  The `id` parameter in the `tva.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Root Cause:**

*   **XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before including it in the generated HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **SQLi:** The application directly uses user-controlled input (`id` parameter) within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
*   **SQLi:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of sensitive information, or even complete control of the server in some scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `motclef` parameter (for the search page) or directly in the URL path for the index page and tricking users into clicking the link, or by injecting the malicious script in stored XSS locations if they exist.
*   **SQLi:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious payloads.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to lure a victim into visiting a malicious URL or inject the malicious code in a place it can be executed when a user accesses the affected functionality.
*   For SQL injection, they need to be able to access the vulnerable page and manipulate the vulnerable `id` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This exploit targets versions 2.8 and 2.9 of Peel Shopping.
*   The exploit examples are based on a local installation (`localhost`), but the vulnerabilities could be exploited on publicly accessible instances of the software.

**CVE Compatibility:**

This information corresponds to the identified CVEs [2012-5226](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-5226) and [2012-5227](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-5227), though it is important to note that the content incorrectly links the CVEs in the exploit section.
