Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-5482:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an authentication bypass in OpenStack Glance, specifically related to image deletion requests.
*   The initial fix for CVE-2012-4573 only addressed the issue in the v1 API of Glance. The vulnerability persisted in the v2 API.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users could delete arbitrary, non-protected images from Glance servers, even if they did not have the necessary permissions. This is because the authorization check was performed after the backend delete operation was initiated.
*   The vulnerability was present in both v1 and v2 APIs of Glance (v2 was not addressed by the initial fix for CVE-2012-4573).

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** Attackers could delete images that they were not authorized to delete, leading to potential data loss and service disruption.
*   **High Impact:** The vulnerability was considered "high" impact due to the potential for significant disruption.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability was exploitable by any authenticated user with access to the Glance API.
*   **API Interaction:** The attack was performed by sending a deletion request to the Glance API for an image the user was not authorized to delete.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed to be a valid, authenticated user in the OpenStack environment. No special administrative privileges were required for the initial exploitation, but the ability to delete images requires an authenticated user.
