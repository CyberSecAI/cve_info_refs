How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

There have been some important updates that have occurred since the
publication of this advisory:

1) When the advisory was published, the patch for the stable/essex
branch had not been merged.  It has now been merged and is *different*
than the original patch.  If you pulled the earlier patch, please update
to the final version.

<https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/efd7e75b1f419a52c7103c7840e24af8e5deb29d>

2) It was discovered that the patches submitted for stable/folsom and
master (grizzly) did not completely solve the problem.  The original
patch only fixed the problem for the v1 API.  The problem still existed
for the v2 API.  Please see this commit for the additional patch:

# [OSSA-2012-017.1] Non-admin users can cause public glance images to be deleted in the v2 api

### Bug Description

It appears that [bug #1065187](/bugs/1065187) also affects the v2 api. From the previous description:

Given a public, non-protected image, a non-admin user can issue a delete against that image which may delete the image from the backend storage repository. The client will get a 403 unauthorized response, but the backend delete method is called prior to checking for those permissions on the glance registry.

Hello Mark, or anyone else affected,

Accepted glance into quantal-proposed. The package will build now and be available at [http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glance/2012.2.1-0ubuntu1](http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glance/2012.2.1-0ubuntu1) in a few hours, and then in the -proposed repository.

Please help us by testing this new package. See <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed> for documentation how to enable and use -proposed. Your feedback will aid us getting this update out to other Ubuntu users.

If this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug, mentioning the version of the package you tested, and change the tag from verification-needed to verification-done. If it does not fix the bug for you, please add a comment stating that, and change the tag to verification-failed. In either case, details of your testing will help us make a better decision.

Subject: [OSSA 2012-017] Authentication bypass for image deletion (CVE-2012-4573)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2012-017
CVE: CVE-2012-4573
Date: November 7, 2012
Title: Authentication bypass for image deletion
Impact: High
Reporter: Gabe Westmaas (Rackspace)
Products: Glance
Affects: Essex, Folsom, Grizzly

Description:
Gabe Westmaas from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Glance
authentication of image deletion requests. Authenticated users may be
able to delete arbitrary, non-protected images from Glance servers. Only
Folsom/Grizzly deployments that expose the v1 API are affected by this
vulnerability. Additionally, Essex deployments that use the
delayed_delete option are also affected.

Fixes:
Grizzly:
<https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/6ab0992e5472ae3f9bef0d2ced41030655d9d2bc>
2012.2 (Folsom):
<https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/90bcdc5a89e350a358cf320a03f5afe99795f6f6>
2012.1 (Essex): <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/15562/>

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1065187](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1065187)

Notes:
This fix will be included in the grizzly-1 development milestone and in
a future 2012.2 (Folsom) release.
