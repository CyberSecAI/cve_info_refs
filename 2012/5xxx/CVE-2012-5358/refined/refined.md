- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the `XSLTCompiledTransform` function which allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of user-controlled XSL data within the `XslCompiledTransform` class leading to unauthenticated arbitrary code execution. Authentication bypass vulnerability within `XSLTCompiledTransform` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the security context of the service running on the web server. Attackers could also cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending specially crafted requests to the server running Ektron CMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker can send a specially crafted request to the server running Ektron CMS. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
