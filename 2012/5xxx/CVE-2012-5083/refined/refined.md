Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2012-5083:

**Relevant Content:**

Multiple sources identify CVE-2012-5083 as a vulnerability related to Java, particularly within the 2D component.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is described as an "unspecified vulnerability" in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component related to 2D.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component related to 2D graphics processing
- It affects several versions of Oracle Java SE and JavaFX

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Arbitrary code execution is possible by bypassing sandbox restrictions, particularly in IBM JDK

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation is possible via "unknown vectors related to 2D"
- Malicious websites containing specially-crafted Java applets can be used as an attack vector, particularly for IBM JDK

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker requires the ability to deliver malicious content to a target system running a vulnerable version of Java. 
- In the case of exploiting the IBM JDK, an attacker needs to persuade a victim to visit a malicious website with a specifically crafted applet, which suggests that user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The IBM support document (swg21616490) mentions that the vulnerability is applicable to Java deployments where untrusted code may be executed under a security manager, such as Java applets running in a web browser.
- Some sources also indicate that this CVE is fixed in later versions of Oracle Java and IBM Java, such as Oracle JDK 7u9 and 6u37.
- Several sources state that this CVE affects multiple components in Oracle and IBM Java.
- Several sources mention that updates for IBM Java 1.4.2, 1.5.0, and 1.6.0 fix this issue.
- Red Hat bugzilla also references multiple errata ([RHSA-2012:1391](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012%3A1391), [RHSA-2012:1392](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012%3A1392), [RHSA-2012:1465](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012%3A1465), [RHSA-2012:1466](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012%3A1466), [RHSA-2012:1467](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012%3A1467), [RHSA-2012:1485](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012%3A1485)) as addressing this issue in multiple products (e.g. RHEL, RH Network Satellite).

**Summary:**

The collected content confirms that CVE-2012-5083 is a critical vulnerability in Java's 2D component, leading to potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability and possibly arbitrary code execution. The attack vector involves delivering malicious java code to a user, often via a browser.
