  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in some YUI 2 .swf files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XSS vulnerability via JavaScript injection in .swf files"
    ],
    "impact": "JavaScript injection exploits can be created against domains that host affected YUI .swf files. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities within the context of the vulnerable domain.",
    "attack_vectors": "By exploiting vulnerabilities in .swf files, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes within the user's browser when they interact with the compromised content. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the handling of certain parameters within the .swf files, which may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code. The vulnerability is present in versions 2.4.0 through 2.9.0 of the YUI library.",
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to inject malicious content that is processed by the vulnerable .swf file. This could involve crafting specific URLs or other methods of providing input to the .swf file. A server hosting a vulnerable file is vulnerable regardless of whether the vulnerable component is used in its web pages."
