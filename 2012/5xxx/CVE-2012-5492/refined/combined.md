Changelog=========
4.2.3 (2012-12-15)------------------
- Cleaned javascripts from plone\_ecmascript of jslint warnings [ichimdav]
- Add various security fixes based on PloneHotfix20121106. [davisagli]
- Pass minute\_step to date\_components\_support\_view.result(). See https://dev.plone.org/ticket/11251 [gbastien]
- Fix form\_tabbing.js so it stays on the same fieldset when an Archetypes edit form is submitted and returns to itself. [davisagli]
- Use prefixed ids for popup overlays [maartenkling]
- Fix compatible hide fieldset legend for IE6/7/8 in form\_tabbing.js [maartenkling]
- Improve error handling on paste action. If it is a real error, the error gets shown and logged. [do3cc]
- Changes to dependencies when creating a new site (plone-final) to fix #11997. [keul]
- Revealed hidden features for sorting folders (#11317). [keul]
- Don't swallow exceptions on object\_paste and folder\_paste (#9365). [gaudenz]
4.2.2 (2012-10-15)------------------
- Do not block right-side portlets in Members folder on site creation. This fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/10764 [polyester]
- Fix prefs\_install\_product\_readme so files with non-ascii characters are rendered. This fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12342 [ericof]
- Fix StringIO module security so it can still be imported from restricted code in Zope 2.13.17+. [davisagli]
- Make sure the portal\_registry setting for ResourceRegistries bundles gets installed. [davisagli]
- Filter out non existing types in getUserFriendlyTypes. This avoids an error on the search form when a no longer existing portal\_type is still in the catalog. [maurits]
- We can safely move the MAX\_TITLE to 50 and even move up MAX\_DESCRIPTION 150 refs #11321 [maartenkling]
- Remove inline styles, they do nothing, add class so someone can style it when they like refs #12438 [maartenkling]

4.2.1.1 (2012-08-23)------------------
- Fixed i18n of image view improvement introduced in 4.2.1. [vincentfretin]
- Ensure some transient dependencies don't vanish in the 4.2 series, just because some libraries get updated and nobody declares the dependency anymore. Same as in the Plone package: zope.copypastemove, zope.app.component, zope.app.container, zope.app.publisher. [maurits]
4.2.1 (2012-08-11)------------------
- Fix: do not display 'file content' on a file view if there is no file. [thomasdesvenain]
- Improve image view: - Add a download button. - Display View button only if image is a web format (jpeg, png, gif...) [thomasdesvenain]
- zope.globalrequest is a required dependency on tests. [hvelarde]
- Remove content-core ID from login\_form. This removes the duplicate ID that occurs on a page when using the login overlay. This fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12439 [cwainwright]
4.2.0.1 (2012-07-02)--------------------
- Add docstring to SkinTool's method to allow them being called from the ZMI. [erral]
4.2 (2012-06-29)----------------
- Add upgrade step to install the CMFEditions component registry bases modifier. [rossp]
- Make redirection\_view/attempt\_redirect fall back to nothing in default\_error\_message template. If plone.app.redirector gets a URL with special characters, OOBTree.get raises a UnicodeDecodeError and the template fails. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12976. [timo]
- Fix jquery.highlightsearchterms.js to not render arbitrary js. [vangheem]
4.2rc2 (2012-05-31)-------------------
- Check the existence of a portal\_type attribute before accessing it to construct navigation URLs. This avoids an exception when constructing breadcrumb navigation for search results if the result is a 'Discussion Item' as the parent Conversation object does not have a portal\_type attribute. [gaudenz]
- For event view template, changed headerless table to headings and divs for better accessibility. See bug #13181 [hmharter]
- Add translatable js message for closing popup boxes. Part of fix for http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12122 [smcmahon]
- Handle server redirects during login via popup by detecting change in base. Fixed by incorporating zenwryly's patch, http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12029 [smcmahon]
- calculate the dynamic fontsize in s5\_slides.js (Presentation Mode) in em, not px. This for WCAG 2.0 compliance. See http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12902 [polyester]
- When adding, changing or removing skins, automatically recook all resource registries, to keep theme bundles in-sync. This mirrors the event subscriber support used in plone.app.registry for the same purpose. [hannosch]
- Let the RR export/import steps depend on the skins tool and plone.app.registry steps, as either of them might create new theme bundles [hannosch]
- Hide Kupu base profile on Plone site creation screen. [hannosch]
- PEP 8 (ignoring W602, W604, E301, E302, E501 and E701). [hvelarde]
- Deprecated aliases were replaced on tests. [hvelarde]
- Ensure multiple tabbed forms on the same page work when number of tabs is greater than threshold. [davidjb]
- Remove deprecated `jq` reference from form tabbing JavaScript. [davidjb]
- Remove incorrect line of form tabbing JavaScript which broke forms with more than 6 tabs. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12877 [davidjb]
- accessibility improvements for screen readers regarding "more" links, see http://dev.plone.org/ticket/11982 [rmattb, applied by polyester]
4.2rc1 (2012-05-07)-------------------
- Fix an outdated "Send this" form handler property reference. [rossp]
- removed search\_form-template form plone\_deprecated-skin. Use collective.searchform if you need this functionality. [tom\_gross]
- Use plone.batching for all batches (PLIP #12235) [tom\_gross]
- Re-apply PLIP 10901 to table\_sort.js, fixing a bug with reversing sort on the first column. [mj]
- Stop filtering folder\_listing to the types from @@plone\_portal\_state/friendly\_types, since that excludes non-searchable types rather than non-listable types. [davisagli]
- PloneControlPanel's enumConfiglets no longer returns invisible configlets. [esteele]
- Hide the (old) Collections control panel by default for new sites. [esteele]
- Use getId() instead of title\_or\_id() for displaying which items get deleted, to avoid unicode error Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12765 [spereverde]
- Allow form tabbing to be used across different DOM documents. [rossp]
- Hide left column in prefs\_main\_template when user does not have access to configlets. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12572 [gotcha]
- Hide left column in prefs\_main\_template when user does not have access to configlets. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12572 [gotcha]
- Make MigrationTool.coreVersions() check for Pillow as well as PIL and PILwoTK. Version will report as "PIL 1.7.6 (Pillow)". Closes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12158 [smcmahon]
- Decode id and bad characters in check\_id script with default\_encoding to prevent UnicodeDecodeError when bad characters contains non-ascii letters. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12525 [pingviini]
- Re-apply PLIP 10901 to table\_sort.js, fixing a bug with reversing sort on the first column. [mj]
- Add keyword 'latest' to metadata.xml's version tag, which then looks for the highest numbered profile that is registered and pins that to the upgrade step. This means that the version field in metadata.xml only has to be set to 'latest' once and then it automatically searches for the highest numbered profile. [eleddy]
4.2b2 (2012-02-09)------------------
- Changed link from search to @@search for the "More" link in livesearch\_reply. [vincentfretin]
- Notify ObjectModifiedEvent when a content title is modified through action > rename. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12460 [thomasdesvenain]
- Fixed some mail tests in combination with five.pt. [maurits]
- Do not display the author contact form when the logged in user does not have an email address. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12258 [maurits]
4.2b1 (2011-12-05)------------------
- Define a ZCML feature called `plone-42` in addition to the existing `plone-4` and `plone-41` to be used in conditional ZCML registrations. [vincentfretin]
- Allow "Site Administrator to add keywords" [kleist, suggested by keul]
- IE critical fix on toggle select and form submit helpers. [thomasdesvenain]
- Fixed the two high priority scenarios (global sections viewlet and nav portlet) of http://dev.plone.org/ticket/11189. [fulv]
- Call the view to unlock an item on unload synchronously, so that the call succeeds on Webkit browsers. This closes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/7885 [davisagli]
- Remove uneeded kss debugging code [jfroche]
- Allow users with the Manage Users permission to change the login name of other users; specifically this allows them to change the email address when this is used as login name. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11255 [maurits]
- Removed the 'What' row in the event view that displayed the keywords; this is already handled by the keywords viewlet. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10818 [maurits]
- Make control panel action GS export return actions alphabetically since there is no other natural ordering. [ggozad]
- Fixed folder\_listing template so that listing macro can be used outside of folder\_listing. [thomasdesvenain]
- Fix PloneTool.changeOwnershipOf to not pass MemberData to the underlying Owned.changeOwnership, but a plain User object only. [stefan]
- Fixed bug that treated ids of objects outside the portal, but on the acquisition path, as reserved. Fixeѕ http://dev.plone.org/ticket/10547 [rochecompaan]
4.2a2 - 2011-08-25------------------
- AuthenticatedUsers group is used for local roles etc, and is not the same as Authenticated role. Thus, it can not be optimized away in catalog queries. [tesdal]
- getFolderContents only sets b\_size if batching is true. [do3cc]
4.2a1 - 2011-08-08------------------
- Added hidden year/month/day/hour/minute/ampm labels to calendar macros. Part of a form accessibility cleanup. [smcmahon]
- Removed registration of the input-label.js from the portal\_javascript tool. Those with a desperate need to support the 'placeholder' text functionality in the obsolete browsers are free to re-register the script in their own instances. [spliter]
- Deprecated input-label.js — instead we are using the HTML5 'placeholder' attribute on the input fields. [spliter]
- Deprecated IEFixes.css after we have introduced Modernizr and removed it's GS registration. References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11300 [spliter]
- Added Modernizr 2 library. References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11300 [spliter]
- Switch to HTML5 doctype. References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11300 [spliter]
- Include plone.app.collection and related packages. Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10902 [esteele]
