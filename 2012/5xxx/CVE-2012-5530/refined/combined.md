| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=875842#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-12 16:28:10 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), a framework and services to support system-level performance monitoring and performance management, performed management of its temporary files used by various services from the suite. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (alter or remove different system files, accessible with the privileges of the user running the PCP suite, than it was originally intended).

Do you possibly know from David if he has contacted the SUSE Security Team to re-send the patches? Or is Red Hat Security Response Team expected to do that?

AIUI there is no expectation that the Red Hat security team will need to propogate any patches (I will confirm that with them too).  My current understanding is that SUSE will provide their full patch series, and I'll be doing the upstream merging (and a pcp-3.6.10 release) which includes all these patches, and also the devtoolset and Fedora updates on Monday (19th Nov).  cheers.  -- Nathan   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=875842#c13)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-19 11:12:50 UTC  ``` Public via:   <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=782967>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=875842#c14)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-19 11:15:33 UTC  ``` Created pcp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 877983](show_bug.cgi?id=877983 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-5530 pcp: Insecure temporary file use flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 877984](show_bug.cgi?id=877984 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-5530 pcp: Insecure temporary file use flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=875842#c16)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-23 02:53:55 UTC  ``` pcp-3.6.10-1.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.

An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has two
fixes is now available. It includes two new package
versions.
Description:
pcp was updated to version 3.6.10 which fixes security
issues and also brings a lot of new features.
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.10.
o Transition daemons to run under an unprivileged
account. o Fixes for security advisory CVE-2012-5530:
tmpfile flaws; (bnc#782967). o Fix pcp(1) command
short-form pmlogger reporting. o Fix pmdalogger error
handling for directory files. o Fix pmstat handling of odd
corner case in CPU metrics. o Correct the python ctype used
for pmAtomValue 32bit ints. o Add missing RPM spec
dependency for python-ctypes. o Corrections to pmdamysql
metrics units. o Add pmdamysql slave status metrics. o
Improve pmcollectl error messages. o Parameterize
pmcollectl CPU counts in interrupt subsys. o Fix generic
RPM packaging for powerpc builds. o Fix python API use of
reentrant libpcp string routines. o Python code backporting
for RHEL5 in qa and pmcollectl. o Fix edge cases in
capturing interrupt error counts.
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.9.
o Python wrapper for the pmimport API o Make
sar2pcp work with the sysstat versions from RHEL5, RHEL6,
and all recent Fedora versions (which is almost all current
versions of sysstat verified). o Added a number of
additional metrics into the importer for people starting to
use it to analyse sar data from real customer incidents. o
Rework use of C99 "restrict" keyword in pmdalogger (Debian
bug: 689552) o Alot of work on the PCP QA suite, special
thanks to Tomas Dohnalek for all his efforts there. o Win32
build updates o Add "raw" disk active metrics so that
existing tools like iostat can be emulated o Allow sar2pcp
to accept XML input directly (.xml suffix), allowing it to
not have to run on the same platform as the sadc/sadf that
originally generated it. o Add PMI error codes into the
PCP::LogImport perl module. o Fix a typo in pmiUnits man
page synopsis section o Resolve pmdalinux ordering issue in
NUMA/CPU indom setup (Redhat bug: 858384) o Remove unused
pmcollectl imports (Redhat bug: 863210) o Allow event
traces to be used in libpcp interpolate mode
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.8.
o Corrects the disk/partition identification for
the MMC driver, which makes disk indom handling correct on
the Raspberry Pi (<http://www.raspberrypi.org/>) o Several
minor/basic fixes for pmdaoracle. o Improve pmcollectl
compatibility. o Make a few clarifications to pmcollectl.1.
o Improve python API test coverage. o Numerous updates to
the test suite in general. o Allow pmda Install scripts to
specify own dso name again. o Reconcile spec file
differences between PCP flavours. o Fix handling of
multiple contexts with a remote namespace. o Core socket
interface abstractions to support NSS (later). o Fix man
page SYNOPSIS section for pmUnpackEventRecords. o Add
--disable-shared build option for static builds.
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.6.
o Added the python PMAPI bindings and an initial
python client in pmcollectl. Separate, new package exists
for python libs for those platforms that split out packages
(rpm, deb). o Added a pcp-testsuite package for those
platforms that might want this (rpm, deb again, mainly) o
Re-introduced the pcp/qa subdirectory in pcp and deprecated
the external pcpqa git tree. o Fix potential buffer
overflow in pmlogger host name handling. o Reworked the
configure --prefix handling to be more like the rest of the
open source world. o Ensure the \_\_pmDecodeText ident
parameter is always set Resolves Red Hat bugzilla bug
#841306.
