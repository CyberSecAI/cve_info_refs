- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (TADDM) uses SSL certificates with a weak MD5 hash algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of a weak MD5 hash algorithm in SSL certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The use of weak MD5 hash algorithm in SSL certificates can potentially compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between TADDM and its clients.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker intercepts the communication, may be able to forge certificates or decrypt the data, due to the usage of a weak algorithm.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between TADDM and its clients to exploit this vulnerability.
