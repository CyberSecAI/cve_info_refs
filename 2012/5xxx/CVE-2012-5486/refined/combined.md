| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=878939#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-21 15:27:53 UTC  ``` A HTTP header injection flaw was found in the way Plone, a user friendly and powerful content management system, performed sanitization of HTTP headers provided within certain URL requests. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when processed would lead the injected HTTP headers to be returned as part of Plone system HTTP response (possibly leading to HTTP response splitting, cross-site scripting [XSS] flaws, session fixation or unauthorized HTTP redirect attacks - to mention some of the possible negative consequences).  References: [1] <http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/20121106/02> [2] <http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/20121106/>  Relevant upstream HotFixes: [3] <http://plone.org/products/plone-hotfix/releases/20121106>  From the OSS post: [4] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/11/07/4>  the setHeader.py change from upstream HotFix is relevant to this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=878939#c4)  Jan Pokorný [poki]    2013-06-13 17:59:42 UTC  ``` Reference: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/930812](https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/%2Bbug/930812)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=878939#c7)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-26 21:52:20 UTC  ``` This issue may affect the version of plone as shipped with EPEL5, however the latest version there is 3.1.6 (and the latest 3.x release is 3.3.5, which was released a year prior to this flaw being discovered).  Given the age of the EPEL5 package and its lack of support, we do not recommend anyone use it.  This issue does affect plone as provided with the conga package on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=878939#c8)  Martin Prpič    2014-09-09 09:40:15 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly sanitize HTTP headers provided within certain URL requests.

# ZPublisher.HTTPRequest.\_scrubHeader allows linefeed injection

Bug #930812 reported by
[David Glick](https://launchpad.net/~davisagli)
on 2012-02-12

[258](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

### Bug Description

The Zope HTTPResponse APIs for setting response headers use a "\_scrubHeader" helper to make sure carriage returns and CRLFs can't be injected into headers.

However it doesn't strip linefeeds (when not following carriage returns), which still allows for header injection with user agents that aren't strict about accepting only CRLF as a header delimiter.

For example, the following sets a cookie in Firefox when it receives the response:

user\_input = '\nSet-Cookie: foo=bar' # from a form or query string

response.redirect('some/path?input=' + user\_input)

RFC 2616, section 2.2, disallows LF in TEXT, tokens, separators, or

quoted text, which are the only legitimate productons for header values

(section 4.2). We should therefore be OK in stripping bare LFs from

header values.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=878945#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-21 15:45:37 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way Plone, a user friendly and powerful content management system, performed protection of privilege to run RestrictedPython scripts. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when processed, would allow the attacker to submit and perform excessively expensive computations or (in conjuction with other attacks) to access or alter privileged information.  References: [1] <http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/20121106/04> [2] <http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/20121106/>  Relevant upstream HotFixes: [3] <http://plone.org/products/plone-hotfix/releases/20121106>  From the OSS post: [4] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/11/07/4>  the python_scripts.py createObject() change from upstream HotFix is relevant to this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=878945#c8)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-26 21:59:04 UTC  ``` This issue may affect the version of plone as shipped with EPEL5, however the latest version there is 3.1.6 (and the latest 3.x release is 3.3.5, which was released a year prior to this flaw being discovered).  Given the age of the EPEL5 package and its lack of support, we do not recommend anyone use it.  This issue does affect plone as provided with the conga package on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=878945#c9)  Martin Prpič    2014-09-09 09:40:16 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly protect the privilege of running RestrictedPython scripts. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would allow the attacker to submit and perform expensive computations or, in conjunction with other attacks, be able to access or alter privileged information.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=878945#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-09-16 05:30:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:1194 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1194.html>   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1194)

## Topic

Updated conga packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Conga project is a management system for remote workstations.
It consists of luci, which is a secure web-based front end, and ricci,
which is a secure daemon that dispatches incoming messages to underlying
management modules.

It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
protect the administrator interface (control panel). A remote attacker
could use this flaw to inject a specially crafted Python statement or
script into Plone's restricted Python sandbox that, when the administrator
interface was accessed, would be executed with the privileges of that
administrator user. (CVE-2012-5485)

It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
sanitize HTTP headers provided within certain URL requests. A remote
attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would
cause the injected HTTP headers to be returned as a part of the Plone HTTP
response, potentially allowing the attacker to perform other more advanced
attacks. (CVE-2012-5486)

Multiple information leak flaws were found in the way conga processed luci
site extension-related URL requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker
could issue a specially crafted HTTP request that, when processed, would
result in unauthorized information disclosure. (CVE-2013-6496)

It was discovered that various components in the luci site
extension-related URLs were not properly restricted to administrative
users. A remote, authenticated attacker could escalate their privileges to
perform certain actions that should be restricted to administrative users,
such as adding users and systems, and viewing log data. (CVE-2014-3521)

It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
protect the privilege of running RestrictedPython scripts. A remote
attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would
allow the attacker to submit and perform expensive computations or, in
conjunction with other attacks, be able to access or alter privileged
information. (CVE-2012-5488)

It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
enforce permissions checks on the membership database. A remote attacker
could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, could allow the
attacker to enumerate user account names. (CVE-2012-5497)

It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
handle the processing of requests for certain collections. A remote
attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would lead
to excessive I/O and/or cache resource consumption. (CVE-2012-5498)

It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
handle the processing of very large values passed to an internal utility
function. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when
processed, would lead to excessive memory consumption. (CVE-2012-5499)

It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, allowed a remote
anonymous user to change titles of content items due to improper
permissions checks. (CVE-2012-5500)

The CVE-2014-3521 issue was discovered by Radek Steiger of Red Hat, and the
CVE-2013-6496 issue was discovered by Jan Pokorny of Red Hat.

In addition, these updated conga packages include several bug fixes.
Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory.
Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.11 Technical Notes,
linked to in the References section, for information on the most
significant of these changes

All conga users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, the luci and ricci services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
