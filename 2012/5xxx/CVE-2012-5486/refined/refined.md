Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-5486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a failure in Plone, a content management system, to properly sanitize HTTP headers included within certain URL requests. Specifically, the `ZPublisher.HTTPRequest._scrubHeader` function did not strip line feed characters (`\n`) when they were not following a carriage return (`\r`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTTP Header Injection:** The primary weakness is the injection of arbitrary HTTP headers by manipulating URL parameters.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  The `_scrubHeader` function failed to adequately sanitize header values by not removing standalone line feeds, allowing for injection of additional headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **HTTP Response Splitting:** An attacker could inject arbitrary headers into the HTTP response leading to HTTP response splitting.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities to perform XSS attacks.
- **Session Fixation:** The ability to control HTTP headers could facilitate session fixation attacks.
- **Unauthorized HTTP Redirects:** An attacker could inject redirect headers, causing the victim's browser to navigate to a malicious site.
- **Other Advanced Attacks:** The injected headers can be used as part of a chain to conduct other more complex attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** A remote attacker crafts a specially crafted URL with malicious header data embedded within query parameters or other URL components.
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know which URL parameters are used in the HTTP header processing and thus vulnerable to the injection.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists because `ZPublisher.HTTPRequest._scrubHeader` only stripped carriage returns and CRLFs but not standalone line feeds.
- The `response.redirect()` function, when used with user-controlled input, is susceptible. For example, `response.redirect('some/path?input=' + user_input)` with `user_input = '\nSet-Cookie: foo=bar'` would allow the injection of the `Set-Cookie` header.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in Plone as included in the `conga` package on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
- The fix involved stripping bare line feeds from header values.
- The vulnerability is referenced in the Plone Security Advisory 20121106/02.
- The fix was included in Zope 2 version 2.13.19.
