- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how IBM SPSS Modeler processes XML documents. A specially crafted XML document can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for the automatic sending of local or remote resource contents to an attacker's server when a victim opens a malicious XML document. It may also allow for denial of service attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data from the victim's system, or cause a denial of service condition, impacting the availability of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted XML document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious XML document and trick the victim into opening it. No specific user capabilities on the victim's system are mentioned.
