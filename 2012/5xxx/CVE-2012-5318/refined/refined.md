Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-5318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies within the `uploadify/scripts/uploadify.php` file of the "Kish Guest Posting" WordPress plugin. The original code in this file allowed unrestricted file uploads, which was exploited for remote code execution. The provided "fix" was inadequate, relying solely on file extension matching rather than proper file type validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of uploaded files. The script initially accepted any file type.
*   **Insufficient Fix:** The "fix" implemented in revisions 403689 and 403694 of the plugin attempts to restrict uploads based on file extension (`.png`, `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`). However, this method is easily bypassed, as file extensions can be easily spoofed.
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The code does not perform actual file type validation (e.g., checking magic bytes), rendering the extension check useless against malicious files with disguised extensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file renamed to a `.jpg`), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server where the WordPress site is hosted. This can lead to complete compromise of the web server and the website itself.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could also upload malicious content to deface the website.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload Functionality:** The attack vector is the vulnerable file upload mechanism in the `uploadify/scripts/uploadify.php` file.
*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers would typically send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious file to be uploaded via the vulnerable script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided context, no authentication is explicitly required to exploit the upload vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the path to `uploadify/scripts/uploadify.php` to target the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
* The mailing list communication confirms that the "fix" implemented by the plugin developer is insufficient and can be bypassed.
* The original poster, Henri Salo, states that he can provide a patch.
