Message-ID: <20121220044629.GL24980@redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 19 Dec 2012 21:46:29 -0700
From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE request: information disclosure flaw in php-ZendFramework
 (ZF2012-05)

There doesn't seem to be a CVE for this issue.  Could one be assigned?
Thanks.

A vulnerability was reported in Zend Framework versions prior to 1.11.15
and 1.12.1, which can be exploited to disclose certain sensitive
information.  This flaw is caused due to an error in the "Zend_Feed_Rss"
and "Zend_Feed_Atom" classes of the "Zend_Feed" component, when
processing XML data.  It can be used to disclose the contents of certain
local files by sending specially crafted XML data including external
entity references.

Package        : zendframework
Vulnerability  : XML external entity inclusion
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5657
Debian Bug     : 696483

Yury Dyachenko discovered that Zend Framework uses the PHP XML parser
in an insecure way, allowing attackers to open files and trigger HTTP
requests, potentially accessing restricted information.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.6-1squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.13-1.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.13-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Security

## Security Advisory: ZF2012-05

# ZF2012-05: Potential XML eXternal Entity injection vectors in Zend Framework 1 Zend\_Feed component

`Zend_Feed_Rss` and `Zend_Feed_Atom` were found to contain potential XML
eXternal Entity (XXE) vectors due to insecure usage of PHP's DOM extension.
External entities could be specified by adding a specific DOCTYPE element to
feeds; exploiting this vulnerability could coerce opening arbitrary files and/or
TCP connections.

A similar issue was fixed for 1.11.13 and 1.12.0, in the `Zend_Feed::import()`
factory method; however, the reporter of the issue discovered that the
individual classes contained similar functionality in their constructors which
remained vulnerable.

## Action Taken

A patch was applied that removes the XXE vector by calling
`libxml_disable_entity_loader()` before attempting to parse the feed via
`DOMDocument::loadXML()`.

## Recommendations

If you are using any of the components listed, and, in particular, were directly
instantiating them, we recommend upgrading to either version 1.11.15 or 1.12.1
or greater.
