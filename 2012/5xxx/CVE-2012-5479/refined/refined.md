Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-5479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way the Moodle Portfolio API handles callbacks. Specifically, it's caused by improper input sanitization and handling of file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include local files. By manipulating the Portfolio API callbacks, an attacker can control which file is accessed by the system.
*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The LFI vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve RCE, if the Moodle data is stored within the web accessible directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server. This could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Moodle instance, gain access to sensitive data, or use the server for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Portfolio API Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the callbacks within the Moodle Portfolio API. This likely involves crafting malicious requests that specify the file path of an uploaded file to be included and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** An attacker likely needs a valid user account within the Moodle system to upload files.
*   **Moodle Data in Web Accessible Directory:** The vulnerability is only exploitable if the Moodle data directory is accessible via the web.
*   **Knowledge of Moodle Internal Structure:** The attacker needs to understand how the Portfolio API works and how to manipulate it to include and execute files.
