Details  * Several models in the CiscoUnified IP Phones 7900 Series contain an input validation vulnerability that could allow a local, authenticated attacker to manipulate arbitrary areas of memory within the device. This is due to a failure to properly validate user-supplied parameters that are passed to kernel system calls. Multiple access vectors have been identified whereby an attacker could gain local access to the device. An attacker can accomplish this by gaining physical access to the device via the AUX port on the back of the device, or remotely by first authenticating to the device via SSH. After the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager) provisions the device, the remote access method is disabled by default.   **Public Demonstrations**      This issue has been publicly demonstrated at several venues. In each demonstration, the devices that are used appear to be unprovisioned phones running an affected version of the Cisco Unified IP Phone software. The demonstrations use a physical attack vector to compromise the phone via a local serial port to place a modified binary on the device, which could then be used to manipulate arbitrary regions of kernel memory by exploiting this issue.      In the demonstrations, the handset microphone is enabled while the handset is in the on-hook position (handset in the cradle). The high-gain area microphones on the TNP devices are electrically connected to the speakerphone active indicator and cannot be bypassed through software manipulation. On the 79x1 Series devices, the handset microphone is controlled by software and the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) channels on the audio codec, which allows the microphone to be activated and the display indicators on the handset to be bypassed.      The 79x2 and 79x5 Series devices are designed to provide additional protections by electrically connecting the handset microphone to the off-hook switch, which prevents the microphone from being activated without any indication.       **Postulated Remote Attacks**      In addition to the physical attack vector, multiple network-based attacks have been postulated that leverage certain behaviors of the Cisco Unified IP Phone. Thus far, the attacks have been predicated on exploiting the use of TFTP. TFTP is an unsecured transport protocol that operates over UDP and is susceptible to spoofing attacks. Cisco recognizes that TFTP is unsecured and has enabled administrators to cryptographically secure phone configuration files transferred over TFTP in Cisco Unified Call Manager Version 5.0 and later. Additionally, in version 8.0(1) and all subsequent releases, Cisco instituted a secure-by-default policy. These releases sign device configuration files by default and disable both the SSH and web daemons on the phones. Signing and encrypting device configuration files prevents an attacker from tampering or replacing these files by spoofing a TFTP server or server response. This is accomplished by verifying the cryptographic signature of these file before they are used by a device.      In addition to these default protections, Cisco provides a comprehensive design guide for all voice network deployments. This includes suggested security feature configurations on intermediate and edge devices to prevent spoofed traffic from being passed on the voice network as well as the isolation and segregation of voice traffic from general network traffic. Security information for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Version 9.0 is available at the following link: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/9x/security.html>      Cisco recognizes that while a number of network, device, and configuration-based mitigations exist, there is no way to mitigate the physical attack vector on the affected devices. To this end, Cisco has conducted a phased remediation approach, which started with an intermediate Engineering Special software release for affected devices, that mitigates known attack vectors for the vulnerability documented in this advisory. This software release was available upon request from the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). Additional enhancements will follow in a Service Release that was posted on Cisco.com on February 14, 2013.       The final remediation of this vulnerability has been made available as part of the 9.4(2) general availability software release for affected devices. The software was posted to Cisco.com in September 2014.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc83860](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc83860) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-5445.      **Software Hardening**Changes have been made to the affected software to harden it against unauthorized access. The following changes have been made:   + Disable the local console port on affected devices.     - This change removes the ability to gain access to the command line of an affected device by physically accessing the AUX/Console port on the phone.   + Remove the default user shell.     - The interactive Unix-like shell has been removed from the affected devices. If SSH has been enabled, and a user successfully authenticates, the only shells available are the debug and log options.These changes have been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCue04937](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue04937) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).      Additional hardening measures have been made in the 9.3(1)SR2 service release. The following change has been made:   + SSH authorized\_keys file is no longer sent to phones     - This change removes the ability to authenticate to a phone via SSH keys only. When SSH is enabled, administrators will need to authenticate via Username and Password as defined in a device's profile.These changes have been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCue04970](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue04970) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).  Workarounds  * Administrators are advised to read and implement the mitigations found in the following Applied Mitigation Bulletin. If Cisco Unified IP Phones are not deployed on a Cisco infrastructure, administrators should at minimum consider deploying encrypted configurations and ensuring that SSH has been disabled. Configuration files from Cisco Unified Communications Manager Version 8.0(1) and later are signed by default for all affected Cisco Unified IP Phones 7900 Series devices.  Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco Unified IP Phone Local Kernel System Call Input Validation Vulnerability" at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=27763>  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released software version 9.4(2) that remediates the vulnerability described in this document.

# Hacking Cisco Phones

Just because you are paranoid doesn't mean your phone isn't listening to everything you say

![](../images/event-5400-128x128.png)

We discuss a set of 0-day kernel vulnerabilities in CNU (Cisco Native
Unix), the operating system that powers all Cisco TNP IP phones. We
demonstrate the reliable exploitation of all Cisco TNP phones via
multiple vulnerabilities found in the CNU kernel. We demonstrate
practical covert surveillance using constant, stealthy exfiltration of
microphone data via a number of covert channels. We also demonstrate the
worm-like propagation of our CNU malware, which can quickly compromise
all vulnerable Cisco phones on the network. We discuss the feasibility
of our attacks given physical access, internal network access and remote
access across the internet. Lastly, we built on last year's presentation
by discussing the feasibility of exploiting Cisco phones from
compromised HP printers and vice versa.

We present the hardware and software reverse-engineering process which
led to the discovery of the vulnerabilities described below. We also
present methods of exploiting the following vulnerabilities remotely.

Cisco PSIRT has assigned CVE Identifier CVE-2012-5445 to this issue.

The issue is being disclosed via a Release Note Enclosure per the Cisco
Vulnerability Policy. The Vulnerability Policy can be found at the
following location:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products*security*vulnerability\_policy.html

I have included the contents of the Release Note Enclosure (RNE) that
will be available via the Cisco Bug Search tool bellow.

Cisco PSIRT appreciates you reporting this issue in a responsible manner
and working with us to remediate the issue. We look forward to your
next report.

<Begin RNE Text>

Symptoms:
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7900 series devices also referred to as Cisco TNP
Phones contain an input validation vulnerability. A local,
authenticated attacker with the ability to place a malicious binary on
the phone could leverage this issue to elevate their privileges or take
complete control of the device.

The issue is due to a failure to properly validate certain system calls
made to the kernel of the device. This failure could allow the attacker
to overwrite arbitrary portions of user or kernel space memory.

The following Cisco Unified IP Phone devices are affected:
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7975G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7971G-GE
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7965G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7962G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7961G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7961G-GE
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7945G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7942G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7941G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7941G-GE
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7931G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7911G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7906

The following models have reached end-of-life (EOL) status (for hardware
only):
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7971G-GE
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7961G
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7961G-GE
Cisco Unified IP Phone 7941G

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 6.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.

Vulnerable ProductsThe following Cisco Unified IP Phones 7900 Series devices are affected by the vulnerability documented in this advisory:   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7906   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7911G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7931G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7941G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7941G-GE   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7942G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7945G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7961G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7961G-GE   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7962G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7965G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7971G-GE   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7975GProducts Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following Cisco Unified IP Phones 7900 Series devices are not affected by the vulnerability documented in this advisory:   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7902G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7905G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7910G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7912G   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7940   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7960   + Cisco Unified IP Phone 7985G   + Cisco Unified Wireless IP Phone 7920 Versions 1/2/3   + Cisco Unified Wireless IP Phone 7921G   + Cisco Unified Wireless IP Phone 7925G   + Cisco Unified Wireless IP Phone 7925G-EX   + Cisco Unified Wireless IP Phone 7926G   + Cisco Unified IP Conference Station 7935   + Cisco Unified IP Conference Station 7936   + Cisco Unified IP Conference Station 7937G   No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Several models in the CiscoUnified IP Phones 7900 Series contain an input validation vulnerability that could allow a local, authenticated attacker to manipulate arbitrary areas of memory within the device. This is due to a failure to properly validate user-supplied parameters that are passed to kernel system calls. Multiple access vectors have been identified whereby an attacker could gain local access to the device. An attacker can accomplish this by gaining physical access to the device via the AUX port on the back of the device, or remotely by first authenticating to the device via SSH. After the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager) provisions the device, the remote access method is disabled by default.   **Public Demonstrations**      This issue has been publicly demonstrated at several venues. In each demonstration, the devices that are used appear to be unprovisioned phones running an affected version of the Cisco Unified IP Phone software. The demonstrations use a physical attack vector to compromise the phone via a local serial port to place a modified binary on the device, which could then be used to manipulate arbitrary regions of kernel memory by exploiting this issue.      In the demonstrations, the handset microphone is enabled while the handset is in the on-hook position (handset in the cradle). The high-gain area microphones on the TNP devices are electrically connected to the speakerphone active indicator and cannot be bypassed through software manipulation. On the 79x1 Series devices, the handset microphone is controlled by software and the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) channels on the audio codec, which allows the microphone to be activated and the display indicators on the handset to be bypassed.      The 79x2 and 79x5 Series devices are designed to provide additional protections by electrically connecting the handset microphone to the off-hook switch, which prevents the microphone from being activated without any indication.       **Postulated Remote Attacks**      In addition to the physical attack vector, multiple network-based attacks have been postulated that leverage certain behaviors of the Cisco Unified IP Phone. Thus far, the attacks have been predicated on exploiting the use of TFTP. TFTP is an unsecured transport protocol that operates over UDP and is susceptible to spoofing attacks. Cisco recognizes that TFTP is unsecured and has enabled administrators to cryptographically secure phone configuration files transferred over TFTP in Cisco Unified Call Manager Version 5.0 and later. Additionally, in version 8.0(1) and all subsequent releases, Cisco instituted a secure-by-default policy. These releases sign device configuration files by default and disable both the SSH and web daemons on the phones. Signing and encrypting device configuration files prevents an attacker from tampering or replacing these files by spoofing a TFTP server or server response. This is accomplished by verifying the cryptographic signature of these file before they are used by a device.      In addition to these default protections, Cisco provides a comprehensive design guide for all voice network deployments. This includes suggested security feature configurations on intermediate and edge devices to prevent spoofed traffic from being passed on the voice network as well as the isolation and segregation of voice traffic from general network traffic. Security information for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Version 9.0 is available at the following link: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/9x/security.html>      Cisco recognizes that while a number of network, device, and configuration-based mitigations exist, there is no way to mitigate the physical attack vector on the affected devices. To this end, Cisco has conducted a phased remediation approach, which started with an intermediate Engineering Special software release for affected devices, that mitigates known attack vectors for the vulnerability documented in this advisory. This software release was available upon request from the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). Additional enhancements will follow in a Service Release that was posted on Cisco.com on February 14, 2013.       The final remediation of this vulnerability has been made available as part of the 9.4(2) general availability software release for affected devices. The software was posted to Cisco.com in September 2014.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc83860](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc83860) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-5445.      **Software Hardening**Changes have been made to the affected software to harden it against unauthorized access. The following changes have been made:   + Disable the local console port on affected devices.     - This change removes the ability to gain access to the command line of an affected device by physically accessing the AUX/Console port on the phone.   + Remove the default user shell.     - The interactive Unix-like shell has been removed from the affected devices. If SSH has been enabled, and a user successfully authenticates, the only shells available are the debug and log options.These changes have been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCue04937](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue04937) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).      Additional hardening measures have been made in the 9.3(1)SR2 service release. The following change has been made:   + SSH authorized\_keys file is no longer sent to phones     - This change removes the ability to authenticate to a phone via SSH keys only. When SSH is enabled, administrators will need to authenticate via Username and Password as defined in a device's profile.These changes have been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCue04970](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue04970) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).  Workarounds  * Administrators are advised to read and implement the mitigations found in the following Applied Mitigation Bulletin. If Cisco Unified IP Phones are not deployed on a Cisco infrastructure, administrators should at minimum consider deploying encrypted configurations and ensuring that SSH has been disabled. Configuration files from Cisco Unified Communications Manager Version 8.0(1) and later are signed by default for all affected Cisco Unified IP Phones 7900 Series devices.  Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco Unified IP Phone Local Kernel System Call Input Validation Vulnerability" at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=27763>  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released software version 9.4(2) that remediates the vulnerability described in this document. Release notes for this update can be found here: [Cisco Unified IP Phone 7900 Series Release 9.4(2)](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cuipph/7900_series/firmware/9-4-2/english/releasenotes/P790_BK_73355F5F_00_7900-series-rn-942/P790_BK_73355F5F_00_7900-series-rn-942_chapter_00.html)      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
