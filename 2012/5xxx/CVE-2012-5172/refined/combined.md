| Measures | Conditions | Severity |
| Access Required | can be attacked over the Internet using packets | * High |
| Authentication | anonymous or no authentication (IP addresses do not count) | * High |
| User Interaction Required | the user must be convinced to take a difficult or suspicious action. If the honest user must have elevated privileges, they are likely to be more suspicious | * Low |
| Exploit Complexity | some expertise and/or luck required (most buffer overflows, guessing correctly in small space, expertise in Windows function calls) | * Mid-High |
