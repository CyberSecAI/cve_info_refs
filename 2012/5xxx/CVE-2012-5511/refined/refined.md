Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-5511:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Several HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) control operations in Xen do not properly validate the size of their inputs.
*   Specifically, the dirty video RAM tracking mechanism involves clearing a bitmap provided by the guest. If this bitmap is excessively large, it can lead to a stack overflow within the hypervisor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The hypervisor does not check if the sizes of the inputs provided by the HVM guest are within acceptable ranges, making it susceptible to excessively large inputs.
*  **Stack Overflow:** An overly large bitmap for dirty video RAM tracking can cause an overflow of an intermediate variable on the hypervisor stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A malicious guest administrator can exploit this vulnerability to cause the Xen hypervisor to become unresponsive or crash. This results in a denial of service to all virtual machines hosted by the compromised hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest Administrator:** The attack can only be performed by an administrator of a HVM guest. They have control over the input sizes and can send specifically crafted, oversized data to the hypervisor.
*   **HVM Control Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered through specific HVM control operations that handle the input from the guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access to HVM Guest:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within a HVM guest virtual machine. This is required to send specific requests to the hypervisor to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all Xen versions from 3.4 onwards.
*   Xen versions 4.2 and later are not susceptible to the stack overflow, though they remain vulnerable to the physical CPU hang.
*   Xen versions 3.4, 4.0 and 4.1 are vulnerable to both the stack overflow and the physical CPU hang.
*   The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests, not PV (Paravirtualized) guests.
*   The OpenSUSE security updates also mention that the fix involves limiting batches of HVM operations, indicating a patch strategy to limit impact from excessive input sizes.
