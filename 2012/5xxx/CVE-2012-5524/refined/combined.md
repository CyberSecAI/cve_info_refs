| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 17:03:56 UTC  ``` Hi!  Python distutils (i.e. setup.py) appears to do extensive probing of the python installation when installing python modules.  This results in many "apparent" sandbox (v0.2.2) violations when trying to merge a python module.    This appears to be the case for all python modules that use distutils to install (although I have only confirmed for gnome-python, PyXML, and Numeric so far) and is true for a python-2.1.1 and python-2.2 installation.  I haven't tested against python-2.0  I believe this is related to setup.py running automake to generate Makefile's and calling some python code in the aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 files located in the top directory of the modules source tree.  Unfortunately, I can't offer a solution at this time.  But I will attach a couple example sandbox.logs to illustrate the problem.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M.

This prevents write outside the allowed dirs, but doesn't make the sandbox to consider this as errors. I don't know however if this doesn't interfere with the correct workings of the python check. To make it easy, you can just use the 'addpredict' bach function in your ebuild. If you're sure that it doesn't 'cause any unwanted behaviour, I could add it to the default sandbox settings. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-15 06:44:52 UTC  ``` I added the SANDBOX_PREDICT var entries and it seems to work well. All packages compile and the few I tested ran well (XChat, 4Suite). Also integrating it into portage 1.8.5-r2 ``` |  |

# Gajim: Information disclosure — GLSA **201401-02**

An error in Gajim causes invalid OpenSSL certificates to be
accepted as valid.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/gajim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.15.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.15.3-r1** |

### Background

Gajim is a Jabber/XMPP client which uses GTK+.

### Description

The \_ssl\_verify\_callback() function in tls\_nb.py does not properly
validate SSL certificates, causing any certificate to be accepted as
valid as long as the root CA is valid.

### Impact

A remote attacker might employ a specially crafted certificate to
conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on SSL connections and potentially
disclose sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Gajim users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/gajim-0.15.3-r1"

```

Subject: Gajim fails to handle invalid certificates

Gajim does not seem to properly handle invalid/broken/expired
certificates. The _ssl_verify_callback function in tls_nb.py is called
by OpenSSL for every certificate in the certificate chain (CA first,
server certificate last) but always return True whether an error was
encountered or not.

This forces OpenSSL to verify each certificate until none is left, at
which points it will call _ssl_verify_callback one last time with an
error number of 0.

(This behavior is documented here:  man 3 SSL_CTX_set_verify
"If verify_callback returns 1, the verification process is continued.
If verify_callback always returns 1, the TLS/SSL handshake will not be
terminated with respect to verification failures and the connection will
be established."
And can be observed in function
crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c:internal_verify() in OpenSSL source code.)

_ssh_verify_callback only stores the last error code, which always is 0
unless an error was encountered in the deepest level of the chain (the
CA), so gajim will not warn as long as the CA is recognized.

(...)

This problem goes beyond expired certificates. It is also possible to
edit any existing and valid server certificate by changing the CN
manually. The certificate's signature will be become invalid and OpenSSL
will detect it and return errnum 7 ("Certificate signature failure") but
gajim will not warn and will proceed with the connection anyway...
