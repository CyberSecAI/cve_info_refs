{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The rubygem-ldap_fluff library in CloudForms did not require a password when using Windows Active Directory as the LDAP authentication backend, allowing anonymous binds.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to improper handling of anonymous LDAP binds.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could log in to the web UI without providing a password.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the web UI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the web UI of CloudForms and the system needs to be configured to use Active Directory for authentication."
