Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-5060:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the **GIS extension** of the MySQL server. Specifically, there is a flaw in how the server handles certain requests related to its spatial data functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   A remote attacker can exploit a flaw within the GIS (Geographic Information System) extension. This suggests a problem with how MySQL parses or processes spatial data related requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** condition, potentially causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the **MySQL protocol**, meaning the vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted network packets to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable MySQL server instance.
*   The attacker needs to send specially crafted requests. It does not require authentication, but it might need a session, requiring a `CREATE SESSION` privilege.
*  The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Oracle advisory and Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201308-06) confirms this vulnerability
*   The Gentoo advisory lists this and other CVEs affecting MySQL version 5.1 prior to 5.1.70.
*   Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1703-1 also confirms the vulnerability as part of a larger set of MySQL vulnerabilities fixed in their updates.
*   Oracle's advisory indicates that for Windows systems, a successful exploit could potentially lead to a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, earning a CVSS base score of 9.0. For other platforms like Linux and Unix, the impact might be less critical, with a CVSS base score of 6.5 and partial+ impacts.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple MySQL versions, including 5.1.65 and 5.5.27.
