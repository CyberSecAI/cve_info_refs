- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflows in the `sys_common_canonicalize` function within `vfs.cc` of HT Editor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `sys_common_canonicalize` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not detailed in the provided information. The disclosure notes that the binary is not SUID, which implies that the impact is likely limited to the privileges of the user running HT Editor, and may potentially be used for local privilege escalation if additional vulnerabilities are found or through abuse of the binaryâ€™s functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a long string is passed to the `sys_common_canonicalize` function. This can occur when a user interactively enters a filename or selects a directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a long input string to the `sys_common_canonicalize` function through interactive user input.
