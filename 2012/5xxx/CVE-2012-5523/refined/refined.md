Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the MantisBT system sending email notifications to users who do not have the necessary access permissions to view the bug or the project it belongs to. This occurs when a bug is cloned with the "Copy bug notes" option and subsequently moved to a different project with different access rights. The email notification system does not properly check if recipients have the required "viewer" level access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Users without access to a bug or project can receive email notifications containing bug details and notes, which they should not be able to see. This constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The `email_collect_recipients` function does not verify the recipient's access rights to the bug before sending notifications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive information about bugs, including details and notes within projects they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  A user with sufficient privileges (e.g. a manager) clones a bug from Project A to create a new bug (Issue B) in the same project while choosing to copy bug notes.
2. The manager then moves Issue B to Project B
3.  Any further action on Issue B such as adding notes or changing its status will cause the system to send email notifications to users who had access to the original bug in Project A, even if they do not have access to Project B or Issue B.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position themselves. The vulnerability relies on actions performed by users with the necessary permissions to clone bugs and move them between projects.
*   The attacker would need to have a user account with some level of access to at least one project to receive notifications from another project to which they don't have access, after the described series of steps have been performed by a privileged user
