| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-22 17:14:54 UTC  ``` It was found that when RHN Proxy was used as a proxy to connect to RHN Satellite, certain pages that should have been protected via SSL (in direct to Satellite connections) were in fact only protected between RHN Proxy and RHN Satellite; the connection between the client and RHN Proxy was not protected via SSL.  This could leak confidential information or authentication credentials when accessing RHN Satellite via RHN Proxy.  By default, yum clients and rhn_register will always communicate with RHN Proxy over HTTPS.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c3)  Jan Pazdziora (Red Hat)    2012-11-26 10:42:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c0)) > It was found that when RHN Proxy was used as a proxy to connect to RHN > Satellite, certain pages that should have been protected via SSL (in direct  Could you please list these "certain pages"?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-28 18:14:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c3)) > (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c0)) > > It was found that when RHN Proxy was used as a proxy to connect to RHN > > Satellite, certain pages that should have been protected via SSL (in direct >  > Could you please list these "certain pages"?   - "/Login.do"  - "/ReLogin.do"   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c23)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-24 21:00:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue was corrected in RHN Satellite 5.6; earlier versions of RHN Satellite are affected.  As RHN Satellite is now in the Production 2 phase of its support and maintenance life cycle, there are currently no plans to address this in future updates for RHN Satellite 5.5 and earlier.  For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/satellite>.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c25)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-10 18:34:31 UTC  ``` This was addressed in the Satellite-Proxy 5.6.0 release available at:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2013-1392.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-22 17:14:54 UTC  ``` It was found that when RHN Proxy was used as a proxy to connect to RHN Satellite, certain pages that should have been protected via SSL (in direct to Satellite connections) were in fact only protected between RHN Proxy and RHN Satellite; the connection between the client and RHN Proxy was not protected via SSL.  This could leak confidential information or authentication credentials when accessing RHN Satellite via RHN Proxy.  By default, yum clients and rhn_register will always communicate with RHN Proxy over HTTPS.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c3)  Jan Pazdziora (Red Hat)    2012-11-26 10:42:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c0)) > It was found that when RHN Proxy was used as a proxy to connect to RHN > Satellite, certain pages that should have been protected via SSL (in direct  Could you please list these "certain pages"?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-28 18:14:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c3)) > (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c0)) > > It was found that when RHN Proxy was used as a proxy to connect to RHN > > Satellite, certain pages that should have been protected via SSL (in direct >  > Could you please list these "certain pages"?   - "/Login.do"  - "/ReLogin.do"   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c23)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-24 21:00:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue was corrected in RHN Satellite 5.6; earlier versions of RHN Satellite are affected.  As RHN Satellite is now in the Production 2 phase of its support and maintenance life cycle, there are currently no plans to address this in future updates for RHN Satellite 5.5 and earlier.  For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/satellite>.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=879369#c25)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-10 18:34:31 UTC  ``` This was addressed in the Satellite-Proxy 5.6.0 release available at:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2013-1392.html>   ``` |  |
