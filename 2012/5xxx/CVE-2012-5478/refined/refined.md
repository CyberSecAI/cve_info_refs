    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is present in the JBoss JMX Invoker's AuthorizationInterceptor. Even when an exception is thrown for unauthorized users, the JMX operation is still performed. This allows authenticated users with JMX Invoker credentials to perform unauthorized JMX operations.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The AuthorizationInterceptor in JBoss JMX Invoker throws an exception for unauthorized users but still proceeds to perform the JMX operation despite the authorization failure.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper authorization check."

      "impact": "A remote attacker with valid JMX Invoker credentials can perform JMX operations for which they do not have the required roles.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker with valid JMX Invoker credentials can make a request for an unauthorized JMX operation."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs valid JMX Invoker credentials but not the required roles for the targeted JMX operation.",
	   "additional_information": "The security interceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation of this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently disabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the JBoss server."
