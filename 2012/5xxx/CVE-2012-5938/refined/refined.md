- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file ownership/permissions in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation due to incorrect file permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially escalate their privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Improper file permissions that can be exploited by an attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker likely needs some level of access to the system where IBM InfoSphere Information Server is installed to exploit the file permission vulnerabilities.
