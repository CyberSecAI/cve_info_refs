# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-22 15:18:07 UTC  ``` A symbol clash issue was found in the pam_ssh_agent_auth PAM module as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Fedora.  In case of certain errors, pam_ssh_agent_auth calls error() function to report problems.  Due to the way pam_ssh_agent_auth was built in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora packages, this led to glibc's error() function being called instead of the error() function from OpenSSH sources that was meant to be used.  As the two error functions expect different arguments, this could cause an application configured to use the pam_ssh_agent_auth module (typically su or sudo) to crash, disclose portion of its memory, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.  This issue did not affect upstream versions of pam_ssh_agent_auth and was specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Fedora packages, where pam_ssh_agent_auth is part of the openssh source RPM.  This bundling is used to avoid duplicating OpenSSH source code.  pam_ssh_agent_auth embeds a copy of the OpenSSH code.  It is not used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Fedora packages, instead OpenSSH code from the OpenSSH build is used.  This flaw was consequence of this way the PAM module is built.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-20 17:31:57 UTC  ``` Fixed in Fedora Rawhide via:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssh.git/commit/?id=4f4687ce8045418f678c323bb22c837f35d7b9fa>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 10:27:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0519 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0519.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c8)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=869903#c0)  Steven Haigh    2012-10-25 06:18:54 UTC  ``` Description of problem: I have set up some critical machines to use publickey + password authentication. I have done this by adding the following to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:         RequiredAuthentications2 publickey,password  I have certain hosts that run automated tasks that require JUST publickey auth. As such, these scripts are currently broken.  I have set up a Match block as follows: Match Address !1.2.3.4/32,*         X11Forwarding no         AllowTcpForwarding no         RequiredAuthentications2 publickey,password  This should allow publickey auth (as the default) to the specific hosts excluded, and require publickey + password for all other hosts.  When trying to run a script that uses a public key, I get the following returned: Authenticated with partial success. Permission denied (password).  The documentation in 'man sshd_config' shows:              Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword.  Available keywords              are AllowAgentForwarding, AllowTcpForwarding, Banner, ChrootDirectory, ForceCommand, GatewayPorts,              GSSAPIAuthentication, HostbasedAuthentication, KbdInteractiveAuthentication,              KerberosAuthentication, KerberosUseKuserok, MaxAuthTries, MaxSessions, PubkeyAuthentication,              AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedKeysCommandRunAs, PasswordAuthentication, PermitEmptyPasswords,              PermitOpen, PermitRootLogin, RequiredAuthentications1, RequiredAuthentications2,              RhostsRSAAuthentication, RSAAuthentication, X11DisplayOffset, X11Forwarding and X11UseLocalHost.  This configuration should therefore work.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): # rpm -qa | grep openssh openssh-5.3p1-81.el6.x86_64 openssh-clients-5.3p1-81.el6.x86_64 openssh-server-5.3p1-81.el6.x86_64   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=869903#c1)  Steven Haigh    2012-10-25 06:21:05 UTC  ``` As a side note, I have also tried matching the single address and using "RequiredAuthentications2 publickey", however I still get a rejection stating further auth was required (password).  Config also tested:  RequiredAuthentications2 publickey,password  Match Address 1.2.3.4/32         X11Forwarding no         AllowTcpForwarding no         RequiredAuthentications2 publickey   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=869903#c3)  Steven Haigh    2012-11-05 04:52:47 UTC  ``` Added to #872608 filed against Fedora:  While I'm not 100% sure of the syntax here, I've also tried the following config:  Match Address 203.56.246.89         X11Forwarding no         AllowTcpForwarding no         RequiredAuthentications2 publickey  Match Address *         X11Forwarding no         AllowTcpForwarding no         RequiredAuthentications2 publickey,password  This has no effect any anyone can log in via public key only.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=869903#c6)  Petr Lautrbach    2012-11-12 17:49:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 643648](attachment.cgi?id=643648&action=diff "fixed required authentications patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=643648&action=edit "fixed required authentications patch") fixed required authentications patch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=869903#c10)  Steven Haigh    2012-11-21 13:53:44 UTC  ``` I've done a bit more testing and I can say that this doesn't *always* work. For example:  Host: 10.1.1.1 has the following in sshd_config: RequiredAuthentications2 publickey,password Match Address 203.56.246.89/32         RequiredAuthentications2 publickey  When I SSH in from 203.56.246.89, I get: # ssh 10.1.1.1 Authenticated with partial success. root.1.1's password:  This shouldn't happen.  # ifconfig | grep addr eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:16:36:35:35:09           inet addr:203.56.246.89  Bcast:203.56.246.95  Mask:255.255.255.240  # ssh -v 10.1.1.1 .... debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering public key: /root/.ssh/identity debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 1045 debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA Authenticated with partial success. debug1: Authentications that can continue: password debug1: Next authentication method: password root.1.1's password:  On 10.1.1.1: # rpm -qa | grep openssh openssh-server-5.3p1-81.el6_3.x86_64 openssh-clients-5.3p1-81.el6_3.x86_64 openssh-5.3p1-81.el6_3.x86_64   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=869903#c11)  Steven Haigh    2012-11-22 00:08:44 UTC  ``` Output from the SSH server side (10.1.1.1) with DEBUG1 set:  Nov 22 11:06:00 xenhost sshd[5256]: Connection from 203.56.246.89 port 58966 Nov 22 11:06:00 xenhost sshd[5256]: debug1: Client protocol version 2.0;

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's Secure Shell (SSH) protocol implementation. These
packages include the core files necessary for the OpenSSH client and
server.

Due to the way the pam\_ssh\_agent\_auth PAM module was built in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6, the glibc's error() function was called rather than the
intended error() function in pam\_ssh\_agent\_auth to report errors. As these
two functions expect different arguments, it was possible for an attacker
to cause an application using pam\_ssh\_agent\_auth to crash, disclose
portions of its memory or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-5536)

Note that the pam\_ssh\_agent\_auth module is not used in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 by default.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* All possible options for the new RequiredAuthentications directive were

not documented in the sshd\_config man page. This update improves the man
page to document all the possible options. (BZ#821641)

* When stopping one instance of the SSH daemon (sshd), the sshd init script

(/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd) stopped all sshd processes regardless of the PID of
the processes. This update improves the init script so that it only kills
processes with the relevant PID. As a result, the init script now works
more reliably in a multi-instance environment. (BZ#826720)

* Due to a regression, the ssh-copy-id command returned an exit status code

of zero even if there was an error in copying the key to a remote host.
With this update, a patch has been applied and ssh-copy-id now returns a
non-zero exit code if there is an error in copying the SSH certificate to a
remote host. (BZ#836650)

* When SELinux was disabled on the system, no on-disk policy was installed,

a user account was used for a connection, and no "~/.ssh" configuration was
present in that user's home directory, the SSH client terminated
unexpectedly with a segmentation fault when attempting to connect to
another system. A patch has been provided to address this issue and the
crashes no longer occur in the described scenario. (BZ#836655)

* The "HOWTO" document /usr/share/doc/openssh-ldap-5.3p1/HOWTO.ldap-keys

incorrectly documented the use of the AuthorizedKeysCommand directive.
This update corrects the document. (BZ#857760)

This update also adds the following enhancements:

* When attempting to enable SSH for use with a Common Access Card (CAC),

the ssh-agent utility read all the certificates in the card even though
only the ID certificate was needed. Consequently, if a user entered their
PIN incorrectly, then the CAC was locked, as a match for the PIN was
attempted against all three certificates. With this update, ssh-add does
not try the same PIN for every certificate if the PIN fails for the first
one. As a result, the CAC will not be disabled if a user enters their PIN
incorrectly. (BZ#782912)

* This update adds a "netcat mode" to SSH. The "ssh -W host:port ..."

command connects standard input and output (stdio) on a client to a single
port on a server. As a result, SSH can be used to route connections via
intermediate servers. (BZ#860809)

* Due to a bug, arguments for the RequiredAuthentications2 directive were

not stored in a Match block. Consequently, parsing of the config file was
not in accordance with the man sshd\_config documentation. This update fixes
the bug and users can now use the required authentication feature to
specify a list of authentication methods as expected according to the man
page. (BZ#869903)

All users of openssh are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which fix these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c0)  Rick Houser    2012-05-30 20:31:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Initscript clobbers other sshd processes.  Please note that this is NOT the same issue as 698777, as we are already running seperate pid files.  The problem is that the existing initscript doesn't use them.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openssh-server-5.3p1-70.el6_2.2.x86_64   How reproducible: Completely   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a second sshd instance listening on a different port (ex. copy the sshd initscript, call it "sshd_alt" or something, then change the pid name, config files, make sure it uses -f to talk to a secondary config file, etc). 2. Copy sshd_config to" sshd_config_alt" or something (match the earlier step). 3. Start both instances. 4. Stop one of the instances (ex. the original one).    Actual results:  The secondary instance is stopped.  The primary might stop too, but I didn't check.   Expected results:  Only the instance that corresponds with the initscript should stop.   Additional info:  The initscript does unsafe things that interfere with other ssh daemons, like this:              killproc $SSHD  The PID file is already available as a variable, so the killproc should probably look something like this:              killproc -p $PID_FILE $SSHD   It looks like a similar problem may be affecting the configuration validation, etc.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c3)  matthew patton    2012-08-30 06:25:12 UTC  ``` The init script needs a complete rethink and rewrite. All variables moved to /etc/sysconfig/`basename $0`, variables derived dynamically from /etc/ssh/sshd_config or other specified file, etc.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c4)  Petr Lautrbach    2012-10-09 15:38:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 624155](attachment.cgi?id=624155 "fixed sshd.init") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=624155&action=edit "fixed sshd.init") fixed sshd.init  This is fixed sshd.init using "killproc -p $PID_FILE $SSHD". It's also slightly changed to simplify process of creating multiple sshd instances. Following steps should work to setup a second sshd instance on the port 2222:  # cp /etc/init.d/sshd /etc/init.d/sshd-second # cp /etc/sysconfig/sshd /etc/sysconfig/sshd-second # echo 'OPTIONS="-f /etc/ssh/sshd_config-second -p 2222 -o PidFile=/var/run/sshd-second.pid"' >> /etc/sysconfig/sshd-second  (plus some SELinux changes)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c5)  Petr Lautrbach    2012-10-09 15:43:38 UTC  ``` > # echo 'OPTIONS="-f /etc/ssh/sshd_config-second -p 2222 -o > PidFile=/var/run/sshd-second.pid"' >> /etc/sysconfig/sshd-second  If you use -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config-second then you also need to change SSHD_CONFIG variable in the new sshd-secong initscript   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c6)  Petr Lautrbach    2012-10-09 16:16:25 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 624155](attachment.cgi?id=624155 "fixed sshd.init") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=624155&action=edit "fixed sshd.init") fixed sshd.init  This initscript is wrong. Starting S15sshd: [  OK  ]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c7)  Petr Lautrbach    2012-10-10 14:53:58 UTC  ``` > The initscript does unsafe things that interfere with other ssh daemons, > like this: >  >             killproc $SSHD >  > The PID file is already available as a variable, so the killproc should > probably look something like this: >  >             killproc -p $PID_FILE $SSHD  will be fixed in next release. Thanks.  >   > It looks like a similar problem may be affecting the configuration > validation, etc.  (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c3)) > The init script needs a complete rethink and rewrite. All variables moved to > /etc/sysconfig/`basename $0`, variables derived dynamically from > /etc/ssh/sshd_config or other specified file, etc.   This would need big change with high regression risc, bugs and so, see my comment #c6. This  scripts hasn't been supposed to be used in multinstance environment. I won't do this.  Sorry.   Please fix your sshd.init copies to avoid problems with configuration validation, sysconfig file and so.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=826720#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 10:27:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-22 15:18:07 UTC  ``` A symbol clash issue was found in the pam_ssh_agent_auth PAM module as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Fedora.  In case of certain errors, pam_ssh_agent_auth calls error() function to report problems.  Due to the way pam_ssh_agent_auth was built in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora packages, this led to glibc's error() function being called instead of the error() function from OpenSSH sources that was meant to be used.  As the two error functions expect different arguments, this could cause an application configured to use the pam_ssh_agent_auth module (typically su or sudo) to crash, disclose portion of its memory, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.  This issue did not affect upstream versions of pam_ssh_agent_auth and was specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Fedora packages, where pam_ssh_agent_auth is part of the openssh source RPM.  This bundling is used to avoid duplicating OpenSSH source code.  pam_ssh_agent_auth embeds a copy of the OpenSSH code.  It is not used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Fedora packages, instead OpenSSH code from the OpenSSH build is used.  This flaw was consequence of this way the PAM module is built.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-20 17:31:57 UTC  ``` Fixed in Fedora Rawhide via:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssh.git/commit/?id=4f4687ce8045418f678c323bb22c837f35d7b9fa>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 10:27:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0519 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0519.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=834618#c8)  Huzaifa S.
