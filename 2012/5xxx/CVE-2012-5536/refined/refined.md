{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A symbol clash issue in the pam_ssh_agent_auth PAM module caused the glibc's error() function to be called instead of the intended error() function from OpenSSH sources, due to the way the module was built in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora packages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Symbol clash",
      "Incorrect function call",
      "Incorrect module building/bundling"
     ],
    "impact": "An application configured to use the pam_ssh_agent_auth module could crash, disclose portions of its memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when certain errors occur within the pam_ssh_agent_auth module, leading to the incorrect error function call.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to trigger a specific error within the pam_ssh_agent_auth module. This might be achievable by a local or authenticated user, depending on how the application using the module is configured."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_products": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Fedora packages where pam_ssh_agent_auth is part of the openssh source RPM.",
    "not_affected": "Upstream versions of pam_ssh_agent_auth.",
    "mitigation": "The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring the correct error() function from OpenSSH was used, and by correcting the way the PAM module is built.",
    "fixed_in_version": "The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2013:0519.",
    "notes": "The pam_ssh_agent_auth module is not used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 by default."
