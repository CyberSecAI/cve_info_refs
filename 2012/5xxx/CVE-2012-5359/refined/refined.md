{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory corruption due to improper parsing of ASF, QT, and WMV files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory corruption",
    "Improper parsing of file formats"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user. Complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Opening a specially crafted file (ASF, QT, or WMV) with a vulnerable version of FFmpeg.",
    "Visiting a website hosting a specially crafted file to exploit the vulnerabilities.",
    "Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file with a vulnerable FFmpeg version, either through email, instant messaging, or web links. No privilege is required to exploit the vulnerability, but the privileges gained depend on the user's rights."
