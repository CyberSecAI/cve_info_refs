The provided content relates to CVE-2012-5354.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `<select>` elements are handled in Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird. Specifically, `<select>` dropdown menus are implemented as always-on-top chromeless windows. When a user navigates away from a page while a `<select>` menu is active, this window is not removed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `<select>` element's dropdown menu persists even after navigating away from the page.
- Arbitrary HTML content can be rendered within the `<option>` elements of the `<select>` menu.
- The persistent dropdown menu can be positioned over arbitrary portions of a new page using absolute positioning and scrolling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Spoofing attacks:** An attacker can overlay content, such as fake login forms or other UI elements, on top of a legitimate web page, deceiving users.
- **Clickjacking attacks:** An attacker can use the persistent dropdown to overlay interactive elements and trick users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking on malicious links or installing unwanted software.

**Attack vectors:**
1. A malicious webpage contains a `<select>` element with an open dropdown menu with malicious HTML content as options.
2. The user navigates away from the malicious page using a method like `window.open` or `document.location`.
3. The `<select>` dropdown menu persists and overlays the new page with the malicious content.
4. The user is then tricked into interacting with malicious content, believing it to be a part of the legitimate new page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create or control a web page that the victim visits.
- The attacker needs to make the victim navigate to another page while keeping the malicious select element active.
- The attacker needs to control the content rendered within the select dropdown menu.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by David Bloom of Cue, with a clickjacking variation found by Jordi Chancel.
- The vulnerability was reported to affect Firefox, SeaMonkey and Thunderbird.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 16, SeaMonkey 2.13, and Thunderbird 16.
- It was noted that the scripting is disabled by default for emails in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey reducing risk in that context.
- The vulnerability is related to an earlier vulnerability (CVE-2012-3984) and multiple bugs of similar nature.
- The vulnerability was not specific to one browser and was present in other browsers such as Opera.
- The fix involved delaying the opening of the menu until the `<select>` element receives focus. This prevents the menu from opening if focus is moved elsewhere during navigation.
