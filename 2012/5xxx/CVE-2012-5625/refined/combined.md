## Synopsis

Important: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0208)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues and multiple
bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (code name Nova), a
cloud computing fabric controller.

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2012.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was found that the boot-from-volume feature in nova-volume did not
correctly validate if the user attempting to boot an image was permitted
to do so. An authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass
intended restrictions, allowing them to boot images they would otherwise
not have access to, exposing data stored in other users' images. This
issue did not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage
mechanism, which is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2013-0208)

When OpenStack Nova was configured to provide guest instances with libvirt
and said guests used LVM-backed ephemeral storage
("libvirt\_images\_type=lvm" in "/etc/nova/nova.conf"), the contents of the
physical volume were not wiped before the volume was returned to the system
for use by a different guest instance. This could lead to a new instance
being able to access files and data from a previous instance. This issue
did not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage mechanism,
which is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2012-5625)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Phil Day as the original reporter of
CVE-2013-0208, and Eric Windisch as the original reporter of CVE-2012-5625.

All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the Nova running services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Bug Description

Nova on stable/folsom is using 'openstack' as its exchange name.

Openstack-common was updated on stable/folsom with this change:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/16532/>

Which brought in this change that removed the default 'nova' exchange config option:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/12876/>

"""

Make projects define 'control\_exchange'.

The 'control\_exchange' option needs to have a project-specific default

value. Just don't register this option and expect it to be registered

by the project using this code, at least for now.

\*\*\*\*\*\* IMPORTANT NOTE WHEN IMPORTING THIS CHANGE \*\*\*\*\*\*

If you are importing this change into a project that uses rpc, you must

add the control\_exchange option in your code!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Change-Id: Ida5a8637c419e709bbf22fcad57b0f11c31bb959

"""

But stable/folsom nova.conf was never updated.

The control\_exchange option has been removed from nova.conf on master too now:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/15940/>

Found this debugging a situation where a child cell couldn't eceive messages from a parent cell. Strangely, setting control\_exchange='openstack' fixed our problem. We're still trying to work out \*why\* there was a mismatch in exchange names at all, given that all cells were running the same nova code and nearly identical configs.

This is bad. We need to fix this so that nova is using the 'nova' exchange.

Fix rpc control\_exchange regression.

A change was made in rpc that requires project's to define the

    control\_exchange option themselves. This was so the project's could

    set their own default value. This change has made it in to nova without

    adding the control\_exchange option, meaning that it is using the default

    of 'openstack', potentially conflicting with other projects.

### Bug Description

libvirt's create\_lvm\_image function will create LVM images on new logical volumes.

Logical volumes are simply linear mappings on a physical volume (PV).

Previously deleted logical volumes leave their dirty blocks (containing user and image data) on the PV. They are not zero'ed.

New LVs will make basic linear mappings to these blocks, leading information disclosure as these LVs are passed to guest virtual machines. LVM's lvcreate does not zero these blocks, nor does the device-mapper configuration used by LVM create any snapshots by default.

One solution may be to use dm-zero as a base image, apply dm-snapshot to a newly-created LV, and pass the snapshot's block device to the guest.

Hmm, thought we had that covered. Pulling in Vish to discuss.

Eric: I suspect that would affect Folsom as well, how about Essex or Diablo ?

Yes, this affects Folsom. I believe this was a new feature for Folsom, so it would not affect Essex or Diablo. The code was added on 2012-05-16 (May).

There are similar concerns in nova-volumes / cinder, but this is slightly better handled there. They wipe the device on deletion, but there are edge-cases where that is insufficient. (That warrants another bug report, actually)

Looking at the code, there definitely seems to be room for leakage.

@Vish: do you confirm that there is a case where those bits are not fully overwritten before being communicated back to another user ?

There are two create\_lvm\_image methods in nova -- virt/libvirt/utils.py and virt/libvirt/imagebackend.py. I assume we're talking about the version in utils.py here because the other one dd's over the lvm.

Isn't an issue here that zeroing will be very slow for large LVMs and therefore delay instance start? Regardless, I've attached a first cut at a patch for comments.

Michael: imagebackend.py only overwrites up to the size of the base image. Nothing outside of imagebackend.py currently seems to use utils.py's create\_lvm\_image function.

We could enforce this at utils.py's function, protective of future code, but then the dd will take unnecessary long. Or, we can just do this from imagebackend.py, where it is used, somewhat better optimized.

Eric your patch seems closest to correct.

You'll probably want to keep the resize2fs() call after the zeroing?

Also there is the caveat that if size is not a multiple of 4MiB the

skip value may be too small and overwrite FS structures.

So you may need another dd invocation to deal with the slop at the start.

Padraig: I think that can be addressed by adding the remainder of bytes to zero\_skip. I'll clarify that.

You're right, the resize2fs() would still be needed. I'll bring it back.

True. I can make a version of this patch that wipes on delete. However, I would like to better understand how delete is triggered, because it isn't clear to me where this happens outside of being an intentional administrative action. Ideally, on startup, a greenthread could spawn to wipe all LVs. Is that happening now? (I haven't found the code that does this, but perhaps I'm not looking hard enough)

I'm still concerned about edge-cases around zero on delete. Perhaps we don't need to care about all these edge cases, but it isn't well documented currently, so users are prone to follow practices that are not secure with wipe-on-delete. I don't think these edge-cases are obvious to deployers.

Specific problems:

 \* Admins manually creating and deleting LVs

 \* Admins using pvmove will find that the old physical volume has extents that have NOT been zero'ed.

 \* Data on the disk existing at time of installation / configuration. (Disks that have been recycled/repurposed, etc)

Ultimately, I'd like to see this code support dm-zero and dm-crypt, but neither are necessarily appropriate for stable-backports.

@Yun: Ideally, the actual removal of the LV only happens on successful execution of the zero-wipe. This is why, at least in my patch, I calculate the size of the volume so that DD won't error at the end of the device (this will need to be tested yet, once we have quorum this is the correct approach)

Thierry, uglier and LVM-only, but yes. I'd personally prefer blockdev moving forward, if only because it could work against other future options such as ZFS or Btrfs volumes. I agree there could be some value in lvs for the backport.

As a not-so-clean example on the shell:

    $ sudo lvs --noheadings --separator , --units b stack-volumes/volume | cut -d, -f4 | sed 's/B$//'

versus:

    $ sudo blockdev --getsize64 stack-volumes/volume

I've confirmed that the byte sizes reported are identical.

Sure, blockdev is perfectly ok in grizzly. I would use lvs in the backport just so that we don't touch the rootwrap config file on a security fix.

tl;dr...

I suggest adding iflag=direct oflag=direct to the first dd, and

changing the second dd to: shred -n0 -z -s$zero\_remainder $path

Details...

I still don't think the second dd invocation is correct,

as the skip= parameter is a block count, whereas you intend it

to be a byte count. Also you want a seek= anyway, not a skip.

You could replace the second dd invocation with something like:

sh -c "(dd seek=$zero\_remainder\_start bs=1 count=0 &&

         dd bs=$zero\_remainder count=1) </dev/zero >$path"

Note newer versions of dd support iflag=count\_bytes,

so this could all be done in a single invocation like

the following, but we can't rely on this being available:

dd iflag=count\_bytes if=/dev/zero count=vol\_size bs=4MiB of=$path

Now the sh -c "dd ..." above is quite awkward, so since this

is only for the slop at the end of the volume, it's probably

better just to do this (though it might need a new rootwrap :()

"shred -n0 -z -s$zero\_remainder"

Performance notes...

I suppose these can be looked at later, I'm just noting

them now when it's a bit fresh in my mind.

1. Since we're usually dd'in on an image after LV creation,

it's probably sufficient to only zero the difference between

image size and the volume size.

2. Related to the previous, that only applies for non

generated images, but the point holds that we may be

better able to optimize (avoid some) zeroing, if done

in the create path, rather than the delete path?

3. TBH I don't understand the sparse option to create\_lvm\_image()

but the underlying lvcreate --virtualsize might be leveraged

to automatically provide zeros for unwritten parts?

4. I would add iflag=direct oflag=direct to the initial

dd invocation, to minimize kernel processing and at least

be consistent with what's done in cinder for volume clearing.

5. In many situations you wouldn't want the overhead involved

(i.e. you dn't need the security), and so would also like to

configure this away along the lines of:

On consideration I've decided to be more conservative with the Folsom patch

and not use O\_DIRECT. John Griffith has seen that writing to the end of

snapshot volumes (the last 6MiB) can give EIO when O\_DIRECT is in effect.

There were no issues seen when writing to standard volumes, as is the case here.

But since this is only a performance consideration, I'm thinking it's better

to be a bit conservative here, lest we trigger an issue on some kernels.

Please validate the impact description:

Title: Information leak in libvirt LVM-backed instances

Reporter: Eric Windisch (Cloudscaling)

Products: Nova

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Eric Windisch from Cloudscaling reported a vulnerability in libvirt LVM-backed instances. The physical volume content was not wiped out before being reallocated and passed to an instance, which may result in the disclosure of information from previously-allocated logical volumes. Only setups using libvirt and LVM-backed instances (libvirt\_images\_type=lvm) are affected.

### Bug Description

libvirt's create\_lvm\_image function will create LVM images on new logical volumes.

Logical volumes are simply linear mappings on a physical volume (PV).

Previously deleted logical volumes leave their dirty blocks (containing user and image data) on the PV. They are not zero'ed.

New LVs will make basic linear mappings to these blocks, leading information disclosure as these LVs are passed to guest virtual machines. LVM's lvcreate does not zero these blocks, nor does the device-mapper configuration used by LVM create any snapshots by default.

One solution may be to use dm-zero as a base image, apply dm-snapshot to a newly-created LV, and pass the snapshot's block device to the guest.

Hmm, thought we had that covered. Pulling in Vish to discuss.

Eric: I suspect that would affect Folsom as well, how about Essex or Diablo ?

Yes, this affects Folsom. I believe this was a new feature for Folsom, so it would not affect Essex or Diablo. The code was added on 2012-05-16 (May).

There are similar concerns in nova-volumes / cinder, but this is slightly better handled there. They wipe the device on deletion, but there are edge-cases where that is insufficient. (That warrants another bug report, actually)

Looking at the code, there definitely seems to be room for leakage.

@Vish: do you confirm that there is a case where those bits are not fully overwritten before being communicated back to another user ?

There are two create\_lvm\_image methods in nova -- virt/libvirt/utils.py and virt/libvirt/imagebackend.py. I assume we're talking about the version in utils.py here because the other one dd's over the lvm.

Isn't an issue here that zeroing will be very slow for large LVMs and therefore delay instance start? Regardless, I've attached a first cut at a patch for comments.

Michael: imagebackend.py only overwrites up to the size of the base image. Nothing outside of imagebackend.py currently seems to use utils.py's create\_lvm\_image function.

We could enforce this at utils.py's function, protective of future code, but then the dd will take unnecessary long. Or, we can just do this from imagebackend.py, where it is used, somewhat better optimized.

Eric your patch seems closest to correct.

You'll probably want to keep the resize2fs() call after the zeroing?

Also there is the caveat that if size is not a multiple of 4MiB the

skip value may be too small and overwrite FS structures.

So you may need another dd invocation to deal with the slop at the start.

Padraig: I think that can be addressed by adding the remainder of bytes to zero\_skip. I'll clarify that.

You're right, the resize2fs() would still be needed. I'll bring it back.

True. I can make a version of this patch that wipes on delete. However, I would like to better understand how delete is triggered, because it isn't clear to me where this happens outside of being an intentional administrative action. Ideally, on startup, a greenthread could spawn to wipe all LVs. Is that happening now? (I haven't found the code that does this, but perhaps I'm not looking hard enough)

I'm still concerned about edge-cases around zero on delete. Perhaps we don't need to care about all these edge cases, but it isn't well documented currently, so users are prone to follow practices that are not secure with wipe-on-delete. I don't think these edge-cases are obvious to deployers.

Specific problems:

 \* Admins manually creating and deleting LVs

 \* Admins using pvmove will find that the old physical volume has extents that have NOT been zero'ed.

 \* Data on the disk existing at time of installation / configuration. (Disks that have been recycled/repurposed, etc)

Ultimately, I'd like to see this code support dm-zero and dm-crypt, but neither are necessarily appropriate for stable-backports.

@Yun: Ideally, the actual removal of the LV only happens on successful execution of the zero-wipe. This is why, at least in my patch, I calculate the size of the volume so that DD won't error at the end of the device (this will need to be tested yet, once we have quorum this is the correct approach)

Thierry, uglier and LVM-only, but yes. I'd personally prefer blockdev moving forward, if only because it could work against other future options such as ZFS or Btrfs volumes. I agree there could be some value in lvs for the backport.

As a not-so-clean example on the shell:

    $ sudo lvs --noheadings --separator , --units b stack-volumes/volume | cut -d, -f4 | sed 's/B$//'

versus:

    $ sudo blockdev --getsize64 stack-volumes/volume

I've confirmed that the byte sizes reported are identical.

Sure, blockdev is perfectly ok in grizzly. I would use lvs in the backport just so that we don't touch the rootwrap config file on a security fix.

tl;dr...

I suggest adding iflag=direct oflag=direct to the first dd, and

changing the second dd to: shred -n0 -z -s$zero\_remainder $path

Details...

I still don't think the second dd invocation is correct,

as the skip= parameter is a block count, whereas you intend it

to be a byte count. Also you want a seek= anyway, not a skip.

You could replace the second dd invocation with something like:

sh -c "(dd seek=$zero\_remainder\_start bs=1 count=0 &&

         dd bs=$zero\_remainder count=1) </dev/zero >$path"

Note newer versions of dd support iflag=count\_bytes,

so this could all be done in a single invocation like

the following, but we can't rely on this being available:

dd iflag=count\_bytes if=/dev/zero count=vol\_size bs=4MiB of=$path

Now the sh -c "dd ..." above is quite awkward, so since this

is only for the slop at the end of the volume, it's probably

better just to do this (though it might need a new rootwrap :()

"shred -n0 -z -s$zero\_remainder"

Performance notes...

I suppose these can be looked at later, I'm just noting

them now when it's a bit fresh in my mind.

1. Since we're usually dd'in on an image after LV creation,

it's probably sufficient to only zero the difference between

image size and the volume size.

2. Related to the previous, that only applies for non

generated images, but the point holds that we may be

better able to optimize (avoid some) zeroing, if done

in the create path, rather than the delete path?

3. TBH I don't understand the sparse option to create\_lvm\_image()

but the underlying lvcreate --virtualsize might be leveraged

to automatically provide zeros for unwritten parts?

4. I would add iflag=direct oflag=direct to the initial

dd invocation, to minimize kernel processing and at least

be consistent with what's done in cinder for volume clearing.

5. In many situations you wouldn't want the overhead involved

(i.e. you dn't need the security), and so would also like to

configure this away along the lines of:

@Thierry: I'm on paternity leave until Friday. I thought I would find time this week, but haven't. I'd have no problems with someone else working on this. I'll be back on the 26th.

On consideration I've decided to be more conservative with the Folsom patch

and not use O\_DIRECT. John Griffith has seen that writing to the end of

snapshot volumes (the last 6MiB) can give EIO when O\_DIRECT is in effect.

There were no issues seen when writing to standard volumes, as is the case here.

But since this is only a performance consideration, I'm thinking it's better

to be a bit conservative here, lest we trigger an issue on some kernels.

Please validate the impact description:

Title: Information leak in libvirt LVM-backed instances

Reporter: Eric Windisch (Cloudscaling)

Products: Nova

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Eric Windisch from Cloudscaling reported a vulnerability in libvirt LVM-backed instances. The physical volume content was not wiped out before being reallocated and passed to an instance, which may result in the disclosure of information from previously-allocated logical volumes. Only setups using libvirt and LVM-backed instances (libvirt\_images\_type=lvm) are affected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c0)  Perry Myers    2012-12-14 15:52:23 UTC  ``` This bug is a temporary workaround for RHOS 2.1 release until a longer term solution can be implemented to use virtio drivers as part of [bug # 865345](show_bug.cgi?id=865345)  The global default for NIC should be changed to e1000 from rtl.  This will provide better performance, at the expense of support for Windows XP guests (which is out of support anyhow)  In a future release we would ideally use a combination of libosinfo and libguestfs to determine based on the image type (storage as image metadata in glance perhaps) and based on whether or not the correct drivers are installed (via libguestfs probing) which network driver to optimally use.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c1)  Nikola Dipanov    2012-12-14 17:24:57 UTC  ``` This seems to be a tweak in the nova.conf that comes with our rpms.  Assigning to Martin to do the nova.conf we ship as a SOURCE in our RPMs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c2)  Daniel Berrangé    2012-12-17 10:10:52 UTC  ``` Given that Nova already hardcodes use of virtio for disks, defaulting to virtio for networking too leaves us no worse off in terms of guest OS compat. This should also be done upstream, not in a RH specific patch.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c3)  Daniel Berrangé    2012-12-17 15:34:15 UTC  ``` Changing subject from e1000 to virtio, on the basis that we already have a hardcoded requirement for virtio.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c4)  Perry Myers    2012-12-17 15:36:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=887303#c2)) > Given that Nova already hardcodes use of virtio for disks, defaulting to > virtio for networking too leaves us no worse off in terms of guest OS > compat.

### Bug Description

libvirt's create\_lvm\_image function will create LVM images on new logical volumes.

Logical volumes are simply linear mappings on a physical volume (PV).

Previously deleted logical volumes leave their dirty blocks (containing user and image data) on the PV. They are not zero'ed.

New LVs will make basic linear mappings to these blocks, leading information disclosure as these LVs are passed to guest virtual machines. LVM's lvcreate does not zero these blocks, nor does the device-mapper configuration used by LVM create any snapshots by default.

One solution may be to use dm-zero as a base image, apply dm-snapshot to a newly-created LV, and pass the snapshot's block device to the guest.

Yes, this affects Folsom. I believe this was a new feature for Folsom, so it would not affect Essex or Diablo. The code was added on 2012-05-16 (May).

There are similar concerns in nova-volumes / cinder, but this is slightly better handled there. They wipe the device on deletion, but there are edge-cases where that is insufficient. (That warrants another bug report, actually)

Looking at the code, there definitely seems to be room for leakage.

@Vish: do you confirm that there is a case where those bits are not fully overwritten before being communicated back to another user ?

There are two create\_lvm\_image methods in nova -- virt/libvirt/utils.py and virt/libvirt/imagebackend.py. I assume we're talking about the version in utils.py here because the other one dd's over the lvm.

Isn't an issue here that zeroing will be very slow for large LVMs and therefore delay instance start? Regardless, I've attached a first cut at a patch for comments.

Michael: imagebackend.py only overwrites up to the size of the base image. Nothing outside of imagebackend.py currently seems to use utils.py's create\_lvm\_image function.

We could enforce this at utils.py's function, protective of future code, but then the dd will take unnecessary long. Or, we can just do this from imagebackend.py, where it is used, somewhat better optimized.

Eric your patch seems closest to correct.

You'll probably want to keep the resize2fs() call after the zeroing?

Also there is the caveat that if size is not a multiple of 4MiB the

skip value may be too small and overwrite FS structures.

So you may need another dd invocation to deal with the slop at the start.

Padraig: I think that can be addressed by adding the remainder of bytes to zero\_skip. I'll clarify that.

You're right, the resize2fs() would still be needed. I'll bring it back.

True. I can make a version of this patch that wipes on delete. However, I would like to better understand how delete is triggered, because it isn't clear to me where this happens outside of being an intentional administrative action. Ideally, on startup, a greenthread could spawn to wipe all LVs. Is that happening now? (I haven't found the code that does this, but perhaps I'm not looking hard enough)

I'm still concerned about edge-cases around zero on delete. Perhaps we don't need to care about all these edge cases, but it isn't well documented currently, so users are prone to follow practices that are not secure with wipe-on-delete. I don't think these edge-cases are obvious to deployers.

Specific problems:

 \* Admins manually creating and deleting LVs

 \* Admins using pvmove will find that the old physical volume has extents that have NOT been zero'ed.

 \* Data on the disk existing at time of installation / configuration. (Disks that have been recycled/repurposed, etc)

Ultimately, I'd like to see this code support dm-zero and dm-crypt, but neither are necessarily appropriate for stable-backports.

@Yun: Ideally, the actual removal of the LV only happens on successful execution of the zero-wipe. This is why, at least in my patch, I calculate the size of the volume so that DD won't error at the end of the device (this will need to be tested yet, once we have quorum this is the correct approach)

Thierry, uglier and LVM-only, but yes. I'd personally prefer blockdev moving forward, if only because it could work against other future options such as ZFS or Btrfs volumes. I agree there could be some value in lvs for the backport.

As a not-so-clean example on the shell:

    $ sudo lvs --noheadings --separator , --units b stack-volumes/volume | cut -d, -f4 | sed 's/B$//'

versus:

    $ sudo blockdev --getsize64 stack-volumes/volume

I've confirmed that the byte sizes reported are identical.

Sure, blockdev is perfectly ok in grizzly. I would use lvs in the backport just so that we don't touch the rootwrap config file on a security fix.

tl;dr...

I suggest adding iflag=direct oflag=direct to the first dd, and

changing the second dd to: shred -n0 -z -s$zero\_remainder $path

Details...

I still don't think the second dd invocation is correct,

as the skip= parameter is a block count, whereas you intend it

to be a byte count. Also you want a seek= anyway, not a skip.

You could replace the second dd invocation with something like:

sh -c "(dd seek=$zero\_remainder\_start bs=1 count=0 &&

         dd bs=$zero\_remainder count=1) </dev/zero >$path"

Note newer versions of dd support iflag=count\_bytes,

so this could all be done in a single invocation like

the following, but we can't rely on this being available:

dd iflag=count\_bytes if=/dev/zero count=vol\_size bs=4MiB of=$path

Now the sh -c "dd ..." above is quite awkward, so since this

is only for the slop at the end of the volume, it's probably

better just to do this (though it might need a new rootwrap :()

"shred -n0 -z -s$zero\_remainder"

Performance notes...

I suppose these can be looked at later, I'm just noting

them now when it's a bit fresh in my mind.

1. Since we're usually dd'in on an image after LV creation,

it's probably sufficient to only zero the difference between

image size and the volume size.

2. Related to the previous, that only applies for non

generated images, but the point holds that we may be

better able to optimize (avoid some) zeroing, if done

in the create path, rather than the delete path?

3. TBH I don't understand the sparse option to create\_lvm\_image()

but the underlying lvcreate --virtualsize might be leveraged

to automatically provide zeros for unwritten parts?

4. I would add iflag=direct oflag=direct to the initial

dd invocation, to minimize kernel processing and at least

be consistent with what's done in cinder for volume clearing.

5. In many situations you wouldn't want the overhead involved

(i.e. you dn't need the security), and so would also like to

configure this away along the lines of:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/12521/>

tl;dr...
I suggest adding iflag=direct oflag=direct to the first dd, and
changing the second dd to: shred -n0 -z -s$zero\_remainder $path
Details...
I still don't think the second dd invocation is correct,
as the skip= parameter is a block count, whereas you intend it
to be a byte count. Also you want a seek= anyway, not a skip.
You could replace the second dd invocation with something like:
sh -c "(dd seek=$zero\_remainder\_start bs=1 count=0 &&
dd bs=$zero\_remainder count=1) </dev/zero >$path"
Note newer versions of dd support iflag=count\_bytes,
so this could all be done in a single invocation like
the following, but we can't rely on this being available:
dd iflag=count\_bytes if=/dev/zero count=vol\_size bs=4MiB of=$path

On consideration I've decided to be more conservative with the Folsom patch

and not use O\_DIRECT. John Griffith has seen that writing to the end of

snapshot volumes (the last 6MiB) can give EIO when O\_DIRECT is in effect.

There were no issues seen when writing to standard volumes, as is the case here.

But since this is only a performance consideration, I'm thinking it's better

to be a bit conservative here, lest we trigger an issue on some kernels.

Please validate the impact description:

Title: Information leak in libvirt LVM-backed instances

Reporter: Eric Windisch (Cloudscaling)

Products: Nova

Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:

Eric Windisch from Cloudscaling reported a vulnerability in libvirt LVM-backed instances. The physical volume content was not wiped out before being reallocated and passed to an instance, which may result in the disclosure of information from previously-allocated logical volumes. Only setups using libvirt and LVM-backed instances (libvirt\_images\_type=lvm) are affected.

Subject: [OSSA 2012-020] Information leak in libvirt LVM-backed instances
 (CVE-2012-5625)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2012-020
CVE: CVE-2012-5625
Date: December 11, 2012
Title: Information leak in libvirt LVM-backed instances
Reporter: Eric Windisch (Cloudscaling)
Products: Nova
Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:
Eric Windisch from Cloudscaling reported a vulnerability in libvirt
LVM-backed instances. The physical volume content was not wiped out
before being reallocated and passed to an instance, which may result in
the disclosure of information from previously-allocated logical volumes.
Only setups using libvirt and LVM-backed instances
(libvirt_images_type=lvm) are affected.

Grizzly (development branch) fix:
<http://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/9d2ea970422591f8cdc394001be9a2deca499a5f>

Folsom fix (included in upcoming Nova 2012.2.2 stable update):
<http://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/a99a802e008eed18e39fc1d98170edc495cbd354>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:17:22 UTC  ```  Russel Bryant rbryant reports on behalf of the OpenStack Project:  Title: Boot from volume allows access to random volumes Reporter: Phil Day (HP) Products: Nova Affects: Essex, Folsom  Description: Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in volume attachment in nova-volume, affecting the boot-from-volume feature. By passing a specific volume ID, an authenticated user may be able to boot from a volume he doesn't own, potentially resulting in full access to that 3rd-party volume contents. Folsom setups making use of Cinder are not affected.  Proposed patches: See attached patches for the Folsom and Essex series. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these proposed patches will be merged to Nova stable/folsom and stable/essex branches on the public disclosure date.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:51:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684893](attachment.cgi?id=684893&action=diff "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=684893&action=edit "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-22 06:52:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684894](attachment.cgi?id=684894&action=diff "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=684894&action=edit "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch") folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:10:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 687206](attachment.cgi?id=687206&action=diff "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=687206&action=edit "essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") essex-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c8)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:11:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 687207](attachment.cgi?id=687207&action=diff "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=687207&action=edit "folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch") folsom-CVE-2013-0208-1069904-v2.patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-25 05:14:15 UTC  ``` Updated patches have been released, the old ones are incorrect and should not be used, I have marked them as obsolete.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=902629#c10)  Murray McAllister    2013-01-29 04:54:24 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
