| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall H.323 Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130116-asa1000v  First Published: 2013 January 16 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuc42812](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc42812)  [CSCuc88741](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc88741)     CVE-2012-5419     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2012-5419     CWE-399       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software for the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall may cause the Cisco ASA 1000V to reload after processing a malformed H.323 message. Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall is affected when H.323 inspection is enabled.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsVersions 8.7.1 and 8.7.1.1 of Cisco ASA Software for the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall are affected by this vulnerability if H.323 inspection is enabled. H.323 Inspection for both H.225 and Registration, Admission and Status (RAS) messages is enabled by default.      The vulnerability exists only if H.323 inspection for H.225 messages is enabled. H.323 inspection for RAS messages has no effect on this vulnerability.      To determine whether H.323 H.225 inspection is enabled, issue the **show service-policy inspect h323 h225** command and verify that a class map is configured with the H.225 inspection engine. If H.323 inspection for H.225 messages is configured, the relevant H.323 output will appear under the referenced class map.      Example output follows: ```   ASA1000v# show service-policy inspect h323 h225    Global policy:      Service-policy: global_policy       Class-map: inspection_default         Inspect: h323 h225 _default_h323_map, packet 0, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0                  tcp-proxy: bytes in buffer 0, bytes dropped 0           h245-tunnel-block drops 0 connection   ``` **Note**: The preceding output identifies a policy map with a class map that has H.323 inspection for H.225 messages applied.      Alternatively, a device that has H.323 inspection for H.225 messages enabled has a configuration similar to the following:    ```   class-map inspection_default     match default-inspection-traffic   !   policy-map global_policy    class inspection_default     ...     inspect h323 h225     ...   !   service-policy global_policy global   ``` **Note**: Global application is shown in the preceding example, but the service policy could also be applied to a specific interface      Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can check the **Service Policy** section under the global or interface specific policies to determine whether the inspection is enabled.      Customers who use Cisco Virtual Network Management Center (VNMC) to manage multiple devices can locate the **Packet Inspection** section under **Policy Management > Security Policies > Root > Tenant > Data Center > Policies** to determine whether the inspection is enabled.     To determine the version of Cisco ASA Software for the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall that is running, issue the **show version** command from the Cisco ASA 1000V command line.  The following example shows a system that is running an affected software version (8.7.1):     ```   ASA1000v(config)# show versionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.7(1)Device Manager Version 6.3(5)   ```      Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed in the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the ASDM window.   Alternatively, version information can be obtained from the Summary tab of the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall resource in the VMware vCenter Server.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableWith the exception of Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall is a virtual security appliance that secures the tenant edge in multitenant private and public cloud deployments. It runs on VMware vSphere Hypervisor software and the Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch exclusively.       The Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall allows virtual machines (VMs) in a virtual data center to access the Internet securely, functions as the default gateway for the VMs, and protects against network-based attacks.      Cisco ASA Software for the 1000V Cloud Firewall versions 8.7.1 and 8.7.1.1 contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the Cisco 1000V Cloud Firewall.      The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed H.323 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted H.323 packet through the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to reload the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, resulting in denial of service (DoS) condition.      A Cisco ASA 1000V device that is configured to inspect H.323 through-the-box traffic may reload when a malformed H.323 IPv4 packet is received.       The H.323 control channel handles H.225, H.245 and H.323 RAS messages. H.323 inspection uses the following well-known ports: 1718-Gatekeeper Discovery UDP port   1719-RAS UDP port   1720-TCP control port Additional dynamic UDP and TCP ports may be negotiated during the H.323 call signaling setup procedure.      A malformed packet sent to any of the well-known ports used by H.323 inspection, or to ports dynamically negotiated by H.323 call signaling setup, may trigger this vulnerability.      Only through-the-box traffic may trigger this vulnerability. Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall is affected only if H.323 inspection for H.225 messages is enabled.      Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall does not support H.323 inspection over IPv6 transport.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCuc42812](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc42812) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCuc88741](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc88741) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE-2012-5419.  Workarounds  * If H.323 inspection is not required, it can be disabled so the device is no longer affected by the vulnerability. Administrators can disable H.323 inspection for H.225 messages by issuing the **no inspect h323 h225** command in class configuration submode in the policy map configuration. H.323 inspection for H.225 messages should be disabled for the workaround to be effective.       The following example shows how to disable H.323 inspection from the default policy-map: ```   ASA1000v(config)# policy-map global_policy   ASA1000v(config-pmap)# class inspection_default   ASA1000v(config-pmap-c)# no inspect h323 h225   ``` If H.323 inspection for H.225 messages is required, there are no workarounds.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       This vulnerability has been fixed in Cisco ASA Software for the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall version 8.7.1.3 and later.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
