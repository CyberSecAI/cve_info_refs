Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed H.323 packets by Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper parsing or handling of malformed H.323 packets when H.323 inspection for H.225 messages is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can cause the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted (malformed) H.323 packet through the affected device to trigger the vulnerability.
- The malformed packet can be sent to any of the well-known ports used by H.323 inspection (1718-1720), or to ports dynamically negotiated during H.323 call signaling.
- Only through-the-box traffic can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to send a malformed H.323 packet.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall when H.323 inspection for H.225 messages is enabled.
- H.323 inspection for RAS messages has no effect on this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco ASA Software versions 8.7.1 and 8.7.1.1.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 8.7.1.3 and later.
- The advisory provides commands to verify if H.323 inspection for H.225 is enabled.
- A workaround is available, which is to disable H.323 inspection for H.225 messages.
- The vulnerability was found during internal testing.
- CVSS Base Score is 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C) and Temporal Score is 6.4
