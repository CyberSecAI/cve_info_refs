Red Hat Satellite engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on Satellite to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs will be migrated starting at the end of May. If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SAT-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1543)

## Topic

Updated CloudForms System Engine packages that fix multiple security
issues, several bugs, and add enhancements are now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms is an on-premise hybrid cloud
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product that lets you create and manage
private and public clouds.

This update fixes bugs in and adds enhancements to the System Engine
packages, and upgrades the system to CloudForms 1.1.

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was discovered that Katello did not properly check user permissions when
handling certain requests. An authenticated remote attacker could use this
flaw to download consumer certificates or change settings of other users'
systems if they knew the target system's UUID. (CVE-2012-5603)

It was discovered that Pulp logged administrative passwords to a world
readable log file. A local attacker could use this flaw to control systems
deployed and managed by CloudForms. (CVE-2012-3538)

It was discovered that the Pulp configuration file pulp.conf was installed
as world readable. A local attacker could use this flaw to view the
administrative password, allowing them to control systems deployed and
managed by CloudForms. (CVE-2012-4574)

It was discovered that grinder used insecure permissions for its cache
directory. A local attacker could use this flaw to access or modify files
in the cache. (CVE-2012-5605)

The CVE-2012-5603 issue was discovered by Lukas Zapletal of Red Hat;
CVE-2012-3538 was discovered by James Laska of Red Hat; CVE-2012-4574 was
discovered by Kurt Seifried of Red Hat; and CVE-2012-5605 was discovered by
James Labocki of Red Hat.

After upgrading to these new packages, follow the instructions in the "4.1.
Upgrading CloudForms System Engine" section of the CloudForms 1.1
Installation Guide:

<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/CloudForms/1.1/html/Installation_Guide/index.html>

To view the full list of changes in this update, view the CloudForms
Technical Notes:

<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/CloudForms/1.1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated CloudForms System Engine
packages, which resolve these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>
