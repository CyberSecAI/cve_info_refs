Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5084:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `security.gentoo.org`, `bugzilla.redhat.com` (865511, 867193), `rhn.redhat.com` (RHSA-2012:1391), and `www.xerox.com` all explicitly mention CVE-2012-5084. These sources confirm that the content is indeed related to this specific CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from "insufficient data validation" in the `javax.swing.text.DefaultFormatter` class.  This class is used for formatting and converting user input in Swing applications.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `DefaultFormatter` class does not properly validate input data, allowing for the possibility of creating instances of inaccessible classes.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Java Sandbox Restrictions:** A remote attacker could potentially bypass Java sandbox restrictions by exploiting this flaw. This would allow them to perform unauthorized actions with escalated privileges.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** In some scenarios, the successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the ability to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Information disclosure:** Several sources indicate that information disclosure is a potential impact of the vulnerability.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. Specifically, it is noted to be exploitable through untrusted Java applets and Java Web Start applications.
*   **Malicious Data:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted input data through the vulnerable `DefaultFormatter` class.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send the malicious input data to the vulnerable system.
*   **Java Applet/Web Start Knowledge:**  The attacker must be able to craft a malicious Java applet or Java Web Start application to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required for the exploit, which makes it easier to execute.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue affects multiple versions of Java SE products, including OpenJDK and Oracle JDK, as well as IBM's implementation.
*   This vulnerability is often grouped with other related Java vulnerabilities in security advisories.

In summary, CVE-2012-5084 is a high-severity vulnerability that allows remote attackers to potentially bypass Java sandbox restrictions and gain unauthorized access through the manipulation of user input validation.
