Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-5668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A NULL pointer dereference exists in the `bdf_free_font` function within the FreeType library's BDF (Bitmap Distribution Format) font parsing module. This occurs when `props_size` is not reset to zero after a memory allocation failure in the `_bdf_parse_start` function. Subsequently, in `bdf_free_font`,  the code attempts to access `font->props[i].format`, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference when the memory for `font->props` hasn't been properly allocated due to the earlier error condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which can cause a program crash and potentially be exploited for malicious purposes.
- **Improper Error Handling:** The code fails to properly handle the case where memory allocation fails, leading to an inconsistent state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the application using the FreeType library, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, a NULL pointer dereference can, in some circumstances, be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by a sophisticated attacker, which is why it's described as having "possible code execution" potential. This is mentioned in the Ubuntu Security Notice and Slackware Security Advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious BDF Font File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted or malformed BDF font file.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick the user into opening or processing the malicious font file. This could involve embedding the malicious font in a document, website, or another medium that the user interacts with.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create Malicious BDF File:** The attacker needs to create a BDF font file that triggers the allocation failure and subsequent NULL pointer dereference.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to convince a user to use the crafted BDF file with an application that utilizes the vulnerable FreeType library. This means social engineering is generally required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the fix involves resetting `props_size` to zero in case of memory allocation failure, preventing the NULL pointer dereference in `bdf_free_font`.
- This vulnerability was identified by Mateusz Jurczyk.
- Several Linux distributions (openSUSE, Ubuntu, Slackware) addressed this vulnerability by releasing updated packages.
