- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The dalbum application does not properly validate requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, allowing unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can add, delete users, and change user passwords without the user's consent.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious website or email contains crafted HTML forms that, when loaded by a logged-in dalbum user, will trigger unintended actions on the dalbum application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or opening a crafted email.
