Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of a temporary file by the server component of Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tools. Specifically, the `adb` server created a log file at `/tmp/adb.log` with a static name during server startup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The `adb` server uses `unix_open("/tmp/adb.log", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND, 0640)` to create a log file in `/tmp` with a static name (`adb.log`). This is vulnerable to symlink attacks.
-   **Symlink Vulnerability:**  A local attacker could create a symbolic link named `/tmp/adb.log` pointing to a file they want to overwrite. When the `adb` server attempts to write to `/tmp/adb.log`, it would follow the symlink and write to the attacker's target file instead.
-   **File Overwrite:**  Due to the symlink vulnerability, an attacker could overwrite arbitrary files accessible with the privileges of the user running the `adb` executable.
-   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Though not direct privilege escalation, this allows a local user to modify system files, potentially causing denial of service or other issues by modifying system-critical configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:**  A local attacker can overwrite any file accessible by the user running the `adb` server.
-   **Unauthorized Content Injection:** Attackers can append unauthorized data to the target file.
-  **Potential System Compromise:** Modification of critical system files by the attacker could lead to unpredictable behavior, denial of service, and potentially system compromise, depending on the target file.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable `adb` server is running.
-   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symbolic link named `/tmp/adb.log` before the `adb` server starts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local User:** The attacker must have a local user account on the affected system.
-   **Timing:** The attacker needs to create the symlink before the `adb` server starts its logging process.
-   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have write permissions to the target file they want to overwrite (via a symlink.)

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was initially reported in Debian bug report #688280.
-   The issue was present in `android-tools` versions 4.1.1 and 5.1.1.r38-1.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in `android-platform-system-core` version 1:7.0.0+r1-4.
-   Newer versions of `adb` now create log files with proper permissions to avoid the symlink vulnerability.
-   Kernel hardening measures in modern systems can mitigate the symlink attack but not in all cases.
-   The log file location was moved to a per-user location to resolve the race condition.
