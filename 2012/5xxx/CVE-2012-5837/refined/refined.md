Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-5837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient privilege separation within the Firefox Developer Toolbar. Specifically, scripts entered directly into the Developer Toolbar's input box were being executed with chrome privileges, instead of the intended limited context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS.  An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the Developer Toolbar.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation because the injected script executes with chrome privileges. This is a significant security concern since chrome privileges allow access to internal browser functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. This opens the door for a wide range of malicious activity, including malware installation.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**  The ability to execute scripts with chrome privileges makes XSS attacks significantly more dangerous, as it may allow for circumvention of intended security mechanisms.
*   **Information Theft:** The attacker could access sensitive information or modify browser behavior.
*   **System compromise:** The attacker could compromise the user's system, especially in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Developer Toolbar Input:** The primary attack vector is the Developer Toolbarâ€™s input box. An attacker could convince a user to paste malicious JavaScript code into this input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** An attacker would need to convince the user to paste malicious code into the Developer Toolbar input.
*   **No Remote Access Required:**  The vulnerability does not require remote access or the user visiting a malicious website. Instead, it depends on the user interacting with a malicious code snippet in the Developer Toolbar.

**Additional Information (from the provided content):**

*   The fix involves using a `sandbox` attribute on the iframe used by the developer toolbar.
*   The fix also restricts how innerHTML is used within the developer tools to prevent injection.
*   The vulnerability affects all Firefox versions since Firefox 15.

This vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 17.
