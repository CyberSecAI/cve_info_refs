Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands within the restricted telnet shell of D-Link DSL2730U routers. The router's implementation passes commands entered in the restricted telnet shell as parameters to the `sh -c` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary OS commands. The telnet shell is designed to have a limited set of allowed commands, but by using command chaining, an attacker can bypass the whitelist. The router's design allows for arbitrary command execution due to how the commands are passed to `sh -c`.
*   **Insufficient Command Whitelisting:** The telnet shell's command whitelist is ineffective since it does not prevent the injection of arbitrary commands through chaining.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated attacker can bypass the command whitelist and execute arbitrary OS commands on the underlying Linux system.
*   The specific impact is not detailed; however, successful command injection can lead to a wide range of consequences, including full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely via the telnet service.
*   **Exploitation via Telnet:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the telnet service on the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate to the telnet service on the router.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to reach the router's telnet interface.
*   **Command Chaining:** The attacker must know how to chain whitelisted commands to execute arbitrary commands.

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**
The D-Link DSL2730U router has a telnet interface with a restricted command set. However, the implementation of the command execution using `sh -c` and the improper neutralization of special elements allows an authenticated user to bypass the command whitelist by chaining commands and injecting arbitrary OS commands. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.
