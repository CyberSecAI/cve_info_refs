## Caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S ---

This chapter provides information about the caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S.

## Caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S

This section describes the caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S. It contains the following topics:

* [Open Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S](/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_rel_notes/asr1k_caveats_38s.html#85572)
* [Resolved Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S](/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_rel_notes/asr1k_caveats_38s.html#11701)

### Open Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S

This section documents the unexpected behavior that might be seen in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S.

* CSCtq81245

Symptom: SPA-4XCT3/DS0 reloads after performing an fp reload.

Conditions: 1. Issue is seen on a single fp system 2. Issue is seen when serial interfaces are configured on the SPA.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc47356

Symptoms: Static routes are not getting removed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Smap - Smap. Removal of CLI does not remove the static route.

Workaround: Remove the ACL before removing the SA.

* CSCuc65049

Symptoms: Routing might not be in accordance with the performance routing policy even when NBAR classifies packets correctly.

Conditions: This may occur after reloading a Performance Routing (PfR) configuration onto the router.

Workaround: When links between routers are defined by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), the problem does not occur. Use the recommended PfR configuration, using OSPF, to define peers for each border router.

* CSCud14945

Symptom: IPv4 IP Security (IPSec) tunnel bring up time is longer in the dynamic crypto-map deployment.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco ASR1000 series router that functions as an IPSec termination and aggregation router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud24378

Symptom: Traffic rate verification fails after QoS configuration changes.

Conditions: On QoS configuration changes, after re-adding the p-map on tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud64870

Symptom: DMVPN hub ASR1004 may crash after the fetching CRL from MS CRL server.

Conditions: The crash occurs when there are 5 CDPs for the hub router to fetch the CRL. Since there are multiple CDPs, the hub router fetches the CRL in a parallel way, which leads to a crash under a timing issue.

Workaround: Setting up one CDP instead of multiple CDPs will avoid the timing condition that leads to the crash.

* CSCud77549

Symptom: CPPOSLIB-3-ERROR\_NOTIFY error messages are reported while trying to configure the inspect policy for the ZBF in ASR1K.

Conditions: ZBF config, good number of entries in the ACL maps under the class-map

Workaround: Reload the ESP and remove the ACL entry that is creating the issue.

* CSCue48456

Symptom: Call is disconnected after CUBE sends  **BYE** to both call legs.

Conditions: Occurs on a video call where a mid-call re-INVITE occurs to modify the media stream.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue50255

Symptom: ucode crashes at  `REM_REM_MISC_ERR_LEAF_INT_INT_REM_POP_REQ_TO_EMPTY_SCHE`

Conditions: on flapping multilink interfaces

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue51375

Symptom: The dynamic monitor is populated with incorrect records and the performance monitor cache incorrectly includes encapsulated traffic.

Conditions: This issue might occur when a GRE tunnel output interface is configured with a performance monitor on an ASR1000 series router, and the output physical interface from which the packets are transmitted is configured with a native FNF monitor.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue53207

Symptom: A record that contains certain derived fields (listed below) may be punted incorrectly to the route processor (RP) and lost.

Conditions: Records can collect “derived” fields; calculating derived fields is dependent on the values of other fields. The fields listed below are incorrectly defined as derived and dependent on other fields. When a record contains one of these fields and does not include its dependent fields, the record is punted to the route processor (RP) to complete the record processing. Punting these records might lead to record loss.

Workaround: When configuring a monitor to collect one of the fields listed below, collect each of the dependent fields also. The list indicates the dependencies:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) “connection delay application sum” is dependent on:

connection delay response to-server sum

connection delay network to-server sum

connection server response sum

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) “connection delay application min” is dependent on:

connection delay response to-server min

connection delay network to-server sum

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) “connection delay application max” is dependent on:

connection delay response to-server max

connection delay network to-server sum

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) “connection delay response client-to-server sum” is dependent on:

connection delay response to-server sum

connection delay network to-server sum

connection server response sum

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) “connection delay response client-to-server min” is dependent on:

connection delay response to-server min

connection delay network to-server sum

connection server response sum

connection delay response to-server sum

connection delay network to-server min.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) “connection delay response client-to-server max” is dependent on:

connection delay response to-server max

connection delay network to-server sum

connection server response sum

connection delay response to-server sum

connection delay network to-server max

* CSCue80506

Symptom: Traceback at DMVPN Spoke registration, DMVPN QoS policy not deployed to QFP datapath component.

Conditions: DMVPN, NHRP, QOS.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf04726

Symptom: With IPsec (crypto-map mode) configured, after VFR disable followed by ASR reboot, the  **no ip virtual-reassembly-out** CLI is lost and VFR is re-enabled.

Conditions:

1. Apply crypto map on the interface.

2. Manually disable VFR with the  **no ip virual-reassembly-out** command.

3. Save config.

4. Reload.

Workaround: After reload, again disable VFR with  **no ip virual-reassembly-out**.

* CSCuf20409

Symptom: Netsync customer seeing clock in ql-failed state on one ASR-2ru.

Conditions: The issue occurred when distributing stratum 1 clock source through its network.

Workaround: If both SPAs are in the same slot, do not send the secondary config.

* CSCuf43548

Symptom: When POS Rx fiber at the tail end of the MPLS TE FRR is pulled, the FRR takes longer than 200 ms to cut over to the other Tunnel.

Conditions: This happens with POS MPLS TE FRR, when head end receives remote defect due to rx fiber pull at the tail end. Remote defects wont trigger FRR quickly.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf50092

Symptom: Flow Around is not working with a 3.8 CCO image.

Conditions: This issue is seen only on 3.8 CCO image and not in 3.8 throttle pull image.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf61531

Symptom: Under load condition with contact-center call flows, some calls might be disconnected unexpectedly. ASR CUBE is sending unexpected  **BYE** for a single call for VZ call flow

Conditions: Load of 40 CPS in a contact-center flow, multiple SIP messages with DSP, and call-block feature.

Details: VZ business call flow, where multiple mid-call re-invites with insertion and deletion of transcoder in the call. Call block is enabled, so no mid-call changes are sent over ISP network.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf65404

Symptom: A call fails if the transcoder is needed for DTMF interworking and vcc offer-all is configured.

Conditions: CUBE reserves the transcoder for codec mismatch and releases the transcoder, since the codecs are identical. But dtmf still requires the transcoder for interworking.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf65537

Symptom: Crash with Verizon contact-center call flow.

Conditions: Crash is observed with CAC configs & 40 cps call rate:

 `UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = RSCCAC CALL DENIAL SCAN -Traceback= 1#0ac7b601f45270393178c559213c70ba :400000 344C0D0 :400000 699DCD1 :400000 344C43B :400000 344C386 :400000 344C6B0 :400000 699D248`

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf74266

Symptom: ASR-CUBE: Crash observed with DSMP.

Conditions: Load scenario issue is observed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug04450

Symptom: PfR fails to control traffic-classes when the subnet mask is greater than the prefix length.

Conditions: The issue is seen either with the default prefix length or when the prefix length is configured.

Workaround: Configure aggregation-type as BGP instead of prefix-length.

* CSCug08561

Symptom: After a Web logon, the user does not get a Web logon response page sent by the portal. If the Web logon is successful, the user is not redirected to the Web address specified. Instead, the user is redirected to the portal for authentication.

Conditions:

1. Walkby feature is enabled with L4R & PBHK features applied to lite session.

2. User initiated the Web logon request.

Details: Upon a Web logon, an account-logon  **COA** request is triggered from the portal to ISG. In ISG, the request triggers conversion of the lite session to a dedicated session. During the conversion, lite session and its associated resources (L4R and PBHK mappings) are removed from PD, and the dedicated session gets provisioned. Once conversion is done, ISG replies to the portal with  **COA ACK/NACK**. Based on the response from ISG, the portal generates a Web logon response-page ( **SUCCESS/FAILURE**) and sends it back to the client.

But when the response packet reaches ISG, it does not get classified to the downstream session (because PBHK & L4R mapping were deleted). As a result, the packet is dropped in ISG.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug12997

Symptom: The ASR 1004 router crashes with:

 `CPPHA-3-FAULT: F0: cpp_ha: CPP:0.0
 desc:ETC_ETC_LOGIC1_LEAF_INT_INT_LP_LONG_PKT_ERR det:DRVR(interrupt) class:OTHER sev:FATAL id:2694 cppstate:STOPPED res:UNKNOWN flags:0x7 cdmflags:0x0`

Conditions: VASI, cryto, mpls, during normal operation (as per what is known).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug21859

Symptom: With NBAR configured on the NAT interface, an ASR1000 crashes on receiving a broken packet.

Conditions: ASR1000 DNS packet coming (broken at L4 header), NBAR configured ( **match protocol dns**), NAT with vasi interfaces.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug27334

Symptom: ASR router might start using new SPIs before quick mode exchange finishes. This causes invalid SPI messages on the receiver side and, in some cases, flap of IKE/IPsec.

Conditions: First seen on IOS XE 15.2(4)S with DMVPN.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug28249

Symptom: The ASR1004 crashes on ESP when enabling NAT. In both of the cores, the packet in question is a DNS packet. The crash is observed when trying to invoke the DNS ALG.

Conditions: Enabling NAT causes ESP to crash

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug28904

Symptom: Router deops ESP packets with CRYPTO-4-RECVD\_PKT\_MAC\_ERR.

Conditions: Peer router sends nonce with length 256Bytes

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug34822

Symptom: ESP might crash.

Conditions: While running  **clear ip nat translations \*** after the forced removal of a NAT mapping.

Workaround:  *Before* removing any NAT mappings, run  **clear ip nat trans \***. And do  *not* use the  **forced** option when removing a NAT mapping. The following is an OK example:

 **ip nat inside source list 1 pool pool1 overload**

* CSCug37490

Symptom: VA leak is seen when removing and reapplying a virtual template from the ISAKMP profile and clearing the crypto session. This results in a stale VA that is up, down and cannot be cleared.

Conditions: When making changes to a virtual template under the ISAKMP profile with client session UP-IDLE (Phase 1 only, as no VT exists).

Workaround: Reload.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S

This section documents the resolved issues in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.2S.

* CSCtc17240

Symptom: Some third party SIP PBXs may have interoperability problems with the authentication header of a Cisco SIP gateway.

Conditions: Per RFC 3261 section 25.1, the  **nc** value, or  **nonce-count**, should have lower case hex. This is defined as follows:

 `nonce-count = "nc" EQUAL nc-value`

 `nc-value = 8LHEX`

 `LHEX = DIGIT / %x61-66;lowercase a-f`

A snippet of the offending message:

`... cnonce="305EE7FF",qop="auth",algorithm=MD5,nc=0000000A`

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtg13667

Symptom:  `Packet_Too_Big (type 2, code 0) and Destination Unreachable Administratively (type 1, code 1)` is not sent back if packets are hitting MTU checking or ACL deny on egress interface.

Conditions: Issue is observed on ASR1000 running 15.0(01)S code.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts83413

Symptom: While configuring Classic Netflow (and possibly Flexible Netflow) for export of records to a user-specified VRF, occaisionally user configuration can get out of sync or invalid. In such a case, the QFP Processor does not have the same VRF information as the IOS config. This results in Netflow export not working.

Conditions: When this was observed, probably multiple cycles of VRF configuration as well as multiple cycles of Netflow export destinations had taken place. The endpoint was that the IOS config was to export to a particular VRF (VRF "BLUE" for example), while the QFP processor had a configuration to export to the default VRF. Thus the configuration was out of sync and Netflow export did not function.

Workaround: Unconfigure the Netflow export destination and to reconfigure it.

* CSCtv93326

Symptom: Inconsistency between IOS CLI and platform state with regard to flow record configuration on the router. Reporting of Mediatrace statistics may fail, with the following error reported on the Mediatrace Initiator device:  `Metrics Collection Status: Fail (19, No statistic data available for reporting)`

Conditions: This is a Flowdef modify event as a result of event consolidation. It can occur in the following scenario: 1. Detach the flowdef associated with a monitor. 2. Change the flowdef (add / delete fields). 3. Re-attach the flowdef to the monitor. For the Mediatrace symptom, the problem can occur when a route change occurs for the traffic being monitored.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtw74598

Symptom: Call Menu (CM) tone may be detected and suppressed in the following call Flow: Modem - - [FXS] - - VG224 - - [MGCP] - - CUCM - - [SIP] - - CUBE - - [SIP] - - PSTN Modem connected to the VG224 places an outbound call to a destination in the PSTN. CM tone from the originating modem gets removed by the VG224. To verify the symptom, enable "debug voip hpi notification" and you would see a line "MODEM CM tone detected" in the debug output.

Conditions: SIP trunk provider does not support NSE based modem passthrough and hence VG224 was not configured with "mgcp modem passthrough".

Workaround: 1. Configure the FXS port as a non-mgcp port, disable fax relay and sg3-to-g3 suppression commands at the voip dial-peer level : dial-peer voice 99920 pots no service mgcpapp port 2/0 dial-peer voice 4001 voip destination-pattern 4001 session protocol sipv2 session target ipv4:<ip-address> codec g711ulaw no fax-relay sg3-to-g3 fax protocol none no vad 2. Downgrade to 15.1(3)T4.

* CSCty59423

Symptoms: Memory leak seen with following messages:

  `Alternate Pool: None Free: 0 Cause: No Alternate pool`

 `-Process= "VOIP_RTCP", ipl= 0, pid= 299`

 `-Traceback= 0x25B1F0Cz 0x25AB6CBz 0x25B1029z 0x46C02Ez 0x46C89Bz 0x46BCC2z 0x471D12z 0x43EF59Ez 0x43DD559z 0x43DCF90z`

 `%SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL: Memory allocation of 780 bytes failed from 0x46C02E, alignment 32`

Conditions: The conditions are unknown.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty94210

Symptom: IKEv2 CERTREQ payloads exchanged by initiator and responder both contain all trustpoints and trustpools. This enhancement request is for limiting the size of the CERTREQ payload based on the configuration (global for responder, IKEv2 profile for initiator).

Conditions: None.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub06422

Symptom: Call flow: PSTN---pri---Voice Gateway---sip---SIP server After running fine for 6-7 days, then 100% of the calls through the voice gateway fail. On a call that comes in through the PRI, INVITE is sent with  `m=audio 0`. Then, on getting  `200 OK` from the other end, the gateway disconnects the call.

Conditions: Router up and running for 6-7 days.

Workaround: Reload the router.

* CSCub19185

Symptoms: Path confirmation fails for a SIP-SIP call with IPV6 enabled.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when UUTs are running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T1.5.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub35268

Symptom: Call dropping issue was found while testing new network based features on AT&T's FlexReach network. The features are network-based Simultaneous Ringing and Sequential Ringing.

Conditions: The following is the behavior for Simultaneous Ringing: 1. Hopon call from PSTN to 7323204351 2. Both Phone 2 (7323204351) and Phone 3 (7323204350) ring 3. Phone 3 is answered, but immediately drops 4. Phone 2 stops ringing (I see CANCEL from AT&T for this call-id) 5. PSTN caller continues to hear ringback tone Per the attached trace, CUBE fails to send a 200 OK with SDP in response to AT&T's re-INVITE to open up the voice channel. For Sequential Ringing: 1. HOPON from 4085271217 (Phone 1) to Phone 3 (7323204350) 2. Note the INVITE has media attribute codec pref 18 0 100 ; INACTIVE 3. CUBE sends 100 Trying then 180 Ringing 4. Phone rings ~3X then call is cancelled by AT&T side by sending SIP CANCEL message 5. CUBE acknowledges by sending 200 ok followed by 487 Request Cancelled 6. AT&T sends INVITE to Phone 2 (7323204351) with media attribute codec pref 18 0 100 ; INACTIVE 7. CUBE sends 100 Trying then 180 Ringing 8. Upon answer - CUBE sends 200 ok with no codec pref in media attribute 9. AT&T sends re-INVITE - with no SDP 10. CUBE sends 100 Trying 11. AT&T sends BYE even before CUBE can send 200 ok 12. Caller from AT&T side hear continuous RINGBACK tone Again, per the attached trace on Sequential Ringing, CUBE fails to send a 200 OK with SDP in response to AT&T's re-INVITE to open up the voice channel. Per AT&T, their side might be sending the BYE because CUBE sends its initial 200 OK with SDP but no codec preference. (refer to Sim. Ring Trace).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub53856

Symptom: On ASR1K and related platforms, when configuring a Flow NetFlow (FNF) Performance Monitor with a record that has a large number of fields (typically 30 or more), the following traceback may be observed at the time that the Service Policy is bound to the interface: %FNF-3-FNF\_FIELD\_LIST\_TOO\_LARGE: Field\_list too large, max 32.

Conditions: Configuring a Performance Monitor, typically with more than 30 fields, and binding it to an interface via a Service Policy.

Workaround: Reduce the number of fields. Using fewer than 30 should work, although it does depend on the exact fields in the record.

* CSCub63208

Memory corruption detected in memory, when allocated for RTCP statistic

Symptom: An error occurs when CALL\_CONTROL-3-STAT\_MEMORY\_CORRUPTED: Memory corruption detected in memory=XYZ allocated for RTCP statistic.

Condition: 3900e running 15.2(3)T1 crash at be\_MediaOper\_UpdateStats

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc27517

Symptom: Permanent license disappear after the IOS upgrade or downgrade.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The ASR1001 IOS is upgraded from 03.05.02 or older to 03.06.00 or later.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The IOS is downgraded from 03.06.00 or later to 03.05.02 or older.

Workaround: Without this fix: Do a license save from 3.4 before the upgrade and re-install in 3.6 in 34, save all the licenses to a file to bootflash 1RU#license save <file location> in 36, install back all the licenses from the file 1RU#license install <file location>.

With this fix: To avoid this, customers have to create a file in the bootflash called 1RU\_34\_36\_ENFORCE\_LICENSE\_MIGRATION to enforce the migration of all the licenses before the upgrade process. The file will be removed automatically after the license migration.

For example: 1RU#license save bootflash:1RU\_34\_36\_ENFORCE\_LICENSE\_MIGRATION For the routers, which are already experiencing this issue, customers can either try to reinstall the licenses or downgrade to 34, create the file in bootflash and upgrade with 36 or later image with this fix again.

* CSCuc39418

* CSCuc42518

Symptom: Cisco IOS Unified Border Element (CUBE) contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS). Cisco IOS CUBE may be vulnerable to a limited Denial of Service (DoS) from the interface input queue wedge condition, while trying to process certain RTCP packets during media negotiation using SIP.

Conditions: Cisco IOS CUBE may experience an input queue wedge condition on an interface configured for media negotiation using SIP when certain sequence of RTCP packets is processed. All the calls on the affected interface would be dropped.

Workaround: Increase the interface input queue size. Disable Video if not necessary.

* CSCuc46087

Symptoms: CUBE does not send a response to an early dialog UPDATE in a glare scenario.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when CUBE receives an early dialog UPDATE when it sends 200OK to INVITE and expects ACK.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc49319

Symptom: An INVITE that contains a Replaces: header and also a parameter in the Request URI will be responded to with a SIP 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist. The transfer that was the trigger of the INVITE with the Replaces: header will fail to complete.

Conditions: This was seen on CUBE when handling a triggered INVITE during a REFER based transfer.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc51076

Symptom: The Reason: header in a SIP BYE may not be consistently passed from the incoming call-leg to the outgoing call-leg.

Conditions: This was seen on CUBE running 15.1(4)M through 15.2(4)M1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc59979

Symptom: The ASR drops the original media stream before the mid call is acknowledged. After the FAX negotiations fail, the ASR does not return/continue to the original media characteristics.

Conditions: Voice to Fax switchover and remote end point do not support fax, so it responds with 488. CUBE does not update call type to voice after 488.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc62078

Symptom: Call Flow: 9971 ---- SIP ---- CUCM ---- SIP ---- CUBE ---- SIP ---- Provider

Issue: Provider does not support video codecs, as soon as an INVITE with video codes in the SDP, provider is disconnecting the call. The customer wants to use Video capability for internal calls and when external call is made, is requesting if they can strip the Video attributes from SDP going in the INVITE to provider.

Conditions: Created voice class sip-profiles 1000 and applied under the outgoing dial-peer to provider. Voice class sip-profiles 1000 request INVITE sdp-header Video-Attribute remove request INVITE sdp-header Video-Media modify "m=video(.\*)" request INVITE sdp-header Video-Bandwidth-Info remove Before applying the profile, below is the snippet of SDP rcv on CUBE: After applying the profile, the SDP is like below:

v=0 o=CiscoSystemsSIP-GW-UserAgent 1127 4805 IN IP4 10.59.0.6 s=SIP Call c=IN IP4 10.59.0.6 t=0 0 m=audio 17800 RTP/AVP 8 101 c=IN IP4 10.59.0.6 a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000 a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000 a=fmtp:101 0-15 a=ptime:20 c=IN IP4 10.59.0.6.

To remove the third c= line, tried the below under sip-profiles: not working as expected: request INVITE sdp-header Video-Session-Info REMOVE\*\*\*Trying to add this line, to see if it will make any difference, however show run, displays Video-Session-Name request INVITE sdp-header Video-Connection-Info REMOVE\*\*\*Trying to add this line, to see if it will make any difference, however show run, displays request INVITE sdp-header remove.

Workaround: If the customer does not have a requirement to have video for external calls, then much better option is to disable video at CUCM only for external calls. This can be done on CUCM by the following ways:

 1. Create a new region on CUCM with video disabled.

 2. Keep the SIP trunk to CUBE in that new region.

 3. This way, internal calls can still have video, and there won't be any video coming to CUBE for external calls.

* CSCuc63246

Symptom: Call Flow: PSTN->PRI->Voice GW->SIP->CUCM->IP phone. During an active call between PSTN and IP phone (non-secure), if the IP phone user presses the Hold key for second time call gets disconnected. Hold and Resume for the first time works fine. MOH server is using SRTP. Also, if the IP phone used is secure (SRTP), then call will not get disconnected; no matter, how many times the user presses the Hold and Resume keys. Customer has mixed mode cluster.

Conditions: When audio session between IP phone and VG is RTP and then the Hold key is pressed for the second time. The MOH uses Secure RTP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc69342

Symptoms: About 10 minutes after CUBE boot, the router crashes with the following traceback: Traceback= 5B01805 46158ED 45F4F57 45BB19E 45BA1CF 451D6DC 4525549 45252D9 4519C30 45196A9 4778FFD. After the reload from the crash, it may take sometime before it crashes again.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when CUBE receives the SIP REFER message with the Refer-To header having no user part.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc71379

Symptom: An incoming INVITE that is received by CUBE with a Replaces: header will dropped that Replaces if the outgoing INVITE must hunt through multiple outbound dial-peers.

Conditions: This was seen on CUBE in a SIP to SIP configuration running 15.2(4)M1.10

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc71735

Symptom: A CUBE running the anti-trombone feature might fail to return SIP SDP contents in a 200 OK message on the original, incoming call leg if the outbound leg failed and was retried.

Conditions: This was seen on CUBE running 15.2(4)M1.10 when handling calls for a SIP proxy in a "proxy-on-a-stick" type configuration (i.e. incoming / outgoing call legs all go through one CUBE).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc76298

Symptoms: In ASR B2B HA setup, the new active router crashes at ccsip\_send\_ood\_options\_ping immediately after switchover with OOD OPTIONS enabled.

Conditions: This crash is seen in the following scenarios:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Standby router has OOD OPTIONS enabled either because it is present in startup configuration or enabled after boot-up.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable OOD OPTIONS.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When Switchover happens.

Conditions: Counter increase due to large control packets.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud50181

Symptom: ESP crashes when handling srtp-rtp interworking calls.

Conditions: srtp-rtp interworking enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud52658

Symptom: IKEv1 CERTREQ payloads exchanged by initiator and responder both contain all trustpoints and trustpools.

Enhancement: This enhancement request was for limiting the size of the CERTREQ payload by not sending trustpools. Benefits:

1. The maximum number of trustpoints that can be sent in a CERTREQ payload are 20. But if the user configures more than 15 trustpoints, IKE would fail because of failure to build the CERTREQ payload (16 trustpoints + inbuilt trustpools > 20).

2. There was a substantial risk for Non-SUDI-enabled devices when authenticating SUDI-enabled devices. This would occur when the non SUDI device has the Cisco Manufacturing Root CA certificate either built-in or downloaded to the device's trustpool. Unless an IKE profile is used, the non SUDI device sends the Mfg CA cert to its peer in the CERTREQ payload.

If the peer is a SUDI device it might send the SUDI chain in the CERT payload in response. This would result in the device successfully authenticating the peer certificate even though no other trust was configured.

* CSCud60977

Symptom: CRL file is not deleted when CS server is unconfigured manually by  **no crypto pki server <name>**.

Conditions: CS server should be run before server is unconfigured:  **crypto pki server <name> no shut**.

Workaround: Delete CRL file manually.

* CSCud61366

Symptom: fp20 & fp40 cards crashes if single bit parity error occurs on TCAM device#1.

Conditions: TCAM (hardware) single bit parity errors are very rare and recoverable. Due to a defect in fault recovery code FP crashes instead of recovering from this hardware error.

Workaround: There is no workaround. May not run into this problem again after FP is rebooted.

* CSCud65119

Symptoms: A crash might occur while using GETVPN with fragmented IPv6 traffic.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when IPv6 IPsec is used. This issue is triggered by fragmented IPv6 packets.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud66669

Symptom: On a 7200 router, the tunnel establishes fine. Encryption and Decryption happens just fine too. However, after decryption, the packet is not punt to the ivrf in which the tunnel interface resides, leading to a broken IPSec DataPath.

Conditions: 7200 with VSA - Tunnel (GRE/mGRE) in an iVRF with Tunnel protection configuration where the iVRF should not be equal to fVRF.

Workaround: Since this issue is not found in 150-1.M9 124-24.T8, downgrading might be an option. Otherwise, there is no known configuration related workaround yet, although software crypto will work just fine.

* CSCud67112

Symptom: In some cases, NBAR does not classify IPv6 HTTP traffic correctly.

Conditions: May occur with IPv6 HTTP traffic.

Workaround: In cases where IPv4 addressing is sufficient, use IPv4 as an alternative.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable gre keepalives on the peer.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Use AES instead of DES as encryption mechanism.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Move towards tunnel-protection-based design instead of cryptomap, and use IPSEC/IKE keepalives instead of GRE keepalives.

* CSCue51886

Symptoms: The SBC CUBE device rejects call connections.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the Chunkmanager holds a lot of memory and calls do not get processed.

Workaround: Reloading the box helps to make the box stable.

* CSCue51967

Symptom: An ASR1K or ISR 4400 router may experience service interruptions and may encounter a QFP microcode software exception. The log will indicate that the router processor has crashed and restarted.

Conditions: The router is performing DMVPN tunneling or is operating as an AppNav controller while collecting data for AVC.

* CSCue52065

Symptom: With WCCP configured, when you replace the configuration, you get get continuous traceback on the console at  **fman\_wccp\_aom\_batch\_begin**.

Condition: Race condition when WCCP interface / WCCP ACL are configured in several miliseconds.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue59759

Symptom: When an AVC policy is assigned to a DMVPN tunnel interface, the packet count in AVC records may be incorrect.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue68258

Symptom: In IOS-XE releases 15.3(1)S2 and 15.3(2)S, upon performing an RP switchover, the following message might be displayed on the console of the newly active RP:

 `%FMFP-3-OBJ_DWNLD_TO_CPP_FAILED: F1: fman_fp_image:`

 `Modify not supported for FLOW-DEF:<> download to CPP failed`

Furthermore, this might cause some of the features on the newly active RP to have stale objects, which can be observed by issuing the following command:

 **show platform software object-manager FP active statistics**

Conditions: The above message appears when Flexible NetFlow was configured on the previously active RP.

Workaround: The only workaround available is to not do an RP switchover. However, if you do go ahead with an RP switchover and end up in the inconsistent state noted above, you can perform one of the following actions to bring the router back to a consistent state on the newly active RP.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Save the running configuration to NVRAM and reload the new RP.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Alternatively, if the system has dual FPs, then perform two FP switchovers successively:

1. Switch over from active FP to standby FP using  **redundancy force-switchover FP**.

2. Switch back from standby to active using the same command.

* CSCue69075

Symptom: BDI interface stops forwarding the traffic.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when there is a loop in data path.

## Caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S

This section describes the caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S. It contains the following topics:

* [Open Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S](/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_rel_notes/asr1k_caveats_38s.html#73361)
* [Resolved Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S](/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_rel_notes/asr1k_caveats_38s.html#39901)

### Open Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S

This section documents the unexpected behavior that might be seen in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S.

* CSCtv93326

Symptom: Inconsistency between IOS CLI and platform state with regard to flow record configuration on the router. Reporting of Mediatrace statistics may fail, with the following error reported on the Mediatrace Initiator device:  `Metrics Collection Status: Fail (19, No statistic data available for reporting)`

Conditions: This is a Flowdef modify event as a result of event consolidation. It can occur in the following scenario: 1. Detach the flowdef associated with a monitor. 2. Change the flowdef (add / delete fields). 3. Re-attach the flowdef to the monitor. For the Mediatrace symptom, the problem can occur when a route change occurs for the traffic being monitored.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua68587

Symptom: cvCallVolConnActiveConnection.sip MIB count does not match what is seen on the CLI.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the Cisco ASR 1006 running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.0S or Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S with the asr1000rp2-adventerprisek9.03.06.00.S.152-2.S image.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub17971

Symptom: No re-registration after switching from hardware to software crypto engine.

Conditions: As per the plan, registration should happen after switching from hardware to software.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub19185

Symptoms: Path confirmation fails for a SIP-SIP call with IPV6 enabled.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when UUTs are running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T1.5.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub53856

Symptom: On ASR1K and related platforms, when configuring a Flow NetFlow (FNF) Performance Monitor with a record that has a large number of fields (typically 30 or more), the following traceback may be observed at the time that the Service Policy is bound to the interface:

 `%FNF-3-FNF_FIELD_LIST_TOO_LARGE: Field_list too large, max 32`

Conditions: Configuring a Performance Monitor, typically with more than 30 fields, and binding it to an interface via a Service Policy.

Workaround: Reduce the number of fields. Using fewer than 30 should work, although it does depend on the exact fields in the record.

* CSCuc12685

Symptoms: A router has an unexpected reload in SIP code.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M4.

* Workaround: There is no workaround.

CSCuc27517

Symptom: The permanent license disappears after an IOS upgrade or downgrade.

Conditions: ASR1001 IOS upgrade from 03.05.02 or older to 03.06.00 or later IOS downgrade from 03.06.00 or later to 03.05.02 or older.

Workaround: Install permanent license again.

* CSCuc42518

Symptom: Cisco IOS Unified Border Element (CUBE) contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS). Cisco IOS CUBE may be vulnerable to a limited Denial of Service (DoS) from the interface input queue wedge condition, while trying to process certain RTCP packets during media negotiation using SIP.

Conditions: Cisco IOS CUBE may experience an input queue wedge condition on an interface configured for media negotiation using SIP when certain sequence of RTCP packets is processed. All the calls on the affected interface would be dropped.

Workaround: Increase the interface input queue size. Disable Video if not necessary.

* CSCuc58527

Symptom: Mac flush does not happen properly with events like Interface shut/noshut or BD shut/noshut.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the mst root priority on R-l2gp config is changed to make the other PE to become root.

Workaround: Use the old CLI format.

* CSCuc73993

Symptom: High packets per second (PPS) in single flow traffic may reduce overall system performance by 90%.

Conditions: Occurs when there is a very high PPS value in single flow traffic, and when NBAR is enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc76298

Symptom: In the ASR B2B HA setup, a new active router crashes at ccsip\_send\_ood\_options\_ping immediately after a switchover with OOD OPTIONS enabled.

Conditions: This crash is seen when a standby router has OOD OPTIONS enabled either because it is present in the startup config or enabled after the bootup. When you disable the OOD OPTIONS, the switchover happens.

Workaround: Reload standby router once after OOD OPTIONS config changes from enabled to disabled.

* CSCuc93739

Symptom: Phase 2 for EzVPN client with split network and VTI does not come up if IPSEC SA goes down.

Conditions: The root cause of the issue is that IPsec SA is not being triggered after IPsec SA is down due to no traffic. This causes IPsec SA to not come UP in spite of the traffic, leading to packet drops in client network. The same problem is not seen with 150-1.M7. This behavior is seen post-PAL where virtual-interface creates a rule set where traffic cannot trigger IPsec SA again once IPsec SA is deleted.

Workaround: 1. Configure ?ip sla? on EZVPN client for split networks, so IPsec SA will not go down. 2. Remove ?virtual-interface? from EZVPN client profile if that is not needed. The problem is not seen in 152-4.M1 without virtual-interface.

* CSCud14945

Symptom: IPv4 IP Security (IPSec) tunnel bring up time is longer in the dynamic crypto-map deployment.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco ASR1000 series router that functions as an IPSec termination and aggregation router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud19536

Symptom: In AVC for IOS XE 3.8, a short downtime is experienced after modifying the AVC configuration.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when removing the media filters on the class-map, thus allowing more traffic to reach the monitor.

Workaround: Leave the configuration as-is, or do not broaden the media filters.

* CSCud50029

Symptom: TX drops seen on LSMPI driver show platform software infrastructure lsmpi driver. The reason for the TX drops (sticky):

 `Bad packet len : 0 Bad buf len : 0 Bad ifindex : 0 No device : 0 No skbuff : 0 Device xmit fail : 663 <<<<<......`

Conditions: Counter increase due to large control packets.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud64870

Symptom: DMVPN hub ASR1004 may crash after the fetching CRL from MS CRL server.

Conditions: The crash occurs when there are 5 CDPs for the hub router to fetch the CRL. Since there are multiple CDPs, the hub router fetches the CRL in a parallel way, which leads to a crash under a timing issue.

Workaround: Setting up one CDP instead of multiple CDPs will avoid the timing condition that leads to the crash.

* CSCud66669

Symptom: On a 7200 router, the tunnel establishes fine. Encryption and Decryption happens just fine too. However, after decryption, the packet is not punt to the ivrf in which the tunnel interface resides, leading to a broken IPSec DataPath.

Conditions: 7200 with VSA - Tunnel (GRE/mGRE) in an iVRF with Tunnel protection configuration where the iVRF should not be equal to fVRF.

Workaround: Since this issue is not found in 150-1.M9 124-24.T8, downgrading might be an option. Otherwise, there is no known configuration related workaround yet, although software crypto will work just fine.

* CSCue19713

Symptom: ASR1013 route processor (RP) reloads due to a watchdog reset.

Conditions: This issue is seen with a power supply which reports fan failure/recovery events continuously.

Workaround: Replace the power supply.

* CSCue21381

Symptom: CUBE ASR 1K crashes during the VOIP FPI process.

Conditions: As of now, the specific call flow leading to this crash is not narrowed down, but based on the code analysis and trace back, it is suspected to happen during the call transfer flow.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue25321

Symptom: BFD flaps continuously upon ESP switchover.

Conditions: This symptom is seen upon ESP switchover.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue27533

Symptom: Multi-VRF Selection with PBR and return traffic is dropped.

Conditions: ASR1002-F/03.07.01.S.

Workaround: Static route in GRT.

* CSCue39206

Symptom: ES Crashes after second 401 Challenge.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when second 401 is received after SDP offer/answer with 183/PRACK is complete. This is a rare scenario.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue42193

Symptom: ASR1k with GetVPN and a large number of ACLs may see tracebacks and fman\_fp crashes on ESP.

Conditions: GetVPN setup and ACLs configured may see these symptoms if the ACL is being modified.

Workaround: Do not modify the ACL.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S

This section documents the resolved issues in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8.1S.

* CSCtx59316

Symptom: A packet punt to RP due to incomplete adjacency gets processed by CoPP. This makes the CoPP complex, as these punted packets are not directed to the system and requires the CoPP to be opened up.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with 3.5.2S and similar releases and by current design.

Workaround: Change the CoPP to allow punted packets.

* CSCua56879

Symptom: XE37 and XE38 images are running with PTP code.

Conditions: XE37 and XE38 are running with PTP code. This feature is not supported in these releases.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua90697

Symptom: Traffic-class cannot be learned with delay as learning type reports is incorrect in a number of TCs.

Conditions: Configurate delay as learning type.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub50350

Symptom: Remote loopback messages under  `show interface` and  `show controller` output are not set correctly.

Conditions: Remote loopback configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you use the  **show platform hardware qfp active feature pfr** command a number of times.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub74272

Symptom: Intermittently during Phase II rekey, after new SPIs are negotiated and inserted into SPD, old SPIs are removed and then the VTI tunnel line protocol goes down.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(3)T, with VTI over GRE.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub78299

Symptom: Ping fails from host1 (192.168.1.2) to host2 (192.168.4.2).

Conditions: This symptom is observed when Suite-B is configured on IPsec sa.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub83071

Symptom: Traceback is observed during RP switchover with mediatrace configuration, since SSO is not supported by mediatrace.

Conditions: Configure mediatrace. Perform RP switchover twice.

Workaround: Remove mediatrace configuration before running RP-switchover. Add mediatrace configuration on new active RP. Or, If traceback occured, remove mediatrace configuration and reapply it.

* CSCub86791

Symptom: The maximum active memory for NBAR flows will exceed the maximum allowed memory.

Condition: This symptom is observed on the 1RU platform with XE3.8 installed. The maximum flows are set to 750000, but the traffic contains flows higher than 750000.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub89144

Symptom: The VTI tunnel is always in up/up state.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when HSRP failover is configured on the HSRP standby router only. This issue was first seen on the Cisco ASR router, but it is platform-independent and is seen on the latest Cisco IOS Release 15M&T and later releases as well.

Workaround: Use GRE or routing protocols for redundancy.

* CSCub98177

Symptom: ASR1K as LAC running IOS XE RLS3.5.2 may disconnect PPP session by TermReq without visible reason, each time in  `show pppoe stat` incrementing  `SSM DISCONNECT`.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in SSO mode, with RP switchover.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc00658

Symptom: Unable to ping direct connected peer ip address.

Conditions: 1. Configure IP reassembly on sub interface. 2. Configure IPv6 reassembly on the same sub interface. 3. No sub interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc05174

Symptom: ESP Crashes.

Conditions: Configuration results in exhaustion of CPP external memory.

Workaround: Ensure that the scale does not exceed supported configurations.

* CSCuc08061

Symptom: IPv6 DMVPN spoke fails to rebuild tunnels with hubs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the tunnel interface on the spoke is removed and reapplied again.

Workaround: Reboot the spoke.

* CSCuc25529

Symptom: Static routes created by RRI are created with the wrong mask for subnet ACLS.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on an ASR1k and 7200 platforms running IOS 15.2(4)S and 15.1(4)M.

Workaround: Configure a static route to the remote network manually.

* CSCuc30500

Symptom: The features NBAR, FNF (AVC), Seawolf (FME), and Lhotse (AppNav) may appear to be activate even when they are down.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when CFT infra is not initialized on these features.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc32543

Symptom: Changes in the configured ppp multilink fragment size or fragment delay are not pushed down to the data path for Broadband MLPPP sessions. This issue does not apply to MLPPP over Serial connections.

Conditions: If ppp multilink fragmentation is enabled on a Broadband MLPPP bundle before the bundle is established and the user later attempts to modify the fragment size or fragment delay, the resulting fragment size changes are not pushed down to the data path (i.e. the original fragment size configuration is retained). The IOS  **show ppp multilink** command indicates that the new fragment size was applied but in fact the new fragment size may not yet be active.

Workaround: After changing the fragment size or fragment delay configuration, restart the Multilink PPP session. This can be accomplished via the  **clear ppp interface**   *<Bundle-Virtual-Access-intf-name>* command.

* CSCuc36469

Symptom: A crash is observed when you remove the  `crypto call admission limit ike in-negotiation-sa <value>` configuration and clear crypto sessions, which triggers a connection from all the clients burdening the server and forcing it to crash within seconds.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only when 150 connections simultaneously try to establish connection with the Head-end Ezvpn server.

Workaround: Ensure you always configure  `crypto call admission limit ike in-negotiation-sa 20` when scaling to 150 tunnels.

* CSCuc39469

Symptom: Unable to monitor the newly inserted 2nd Power supply in ASR1001.

Conditions: Insert the 2nd Power Supply to the up and running ASR1001.

Workaround: Ensure that all power supplies are inserted before booting up the ASR1001.

* CSCuc41243

Symptom: PfR border router might get reloaded when PfR session flap is under session condition.

Conditions: PfR BR session flap is under session condition. This condition cannot be reproduced in the lab.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc44071

Symptom: GRE keepalives go out unencrypted if the Tunnel interface is in  **up / protocol down** state.

Conditions: ASR1k platform (reproduced on 3.4S through 3.7S) - GRE/IPsec using tunnel protection - keepalives configured on GRE/IPsec tunnel - Tunnel interface in protocol down state because of previously missed GRE keepalives - PIM configured on Tunnel interface -  **ip multicast-routing distributed** configured globally.

Workaround: Disable  **ip multicast-routing distributed** (possible performance impact) or remove PIM configuration from Tunnel interface. The GRE keepalives will be encrypted as long as there is no CEF adjacency on the Tunnel interface when in protocol down state (i.e. no output from  **show adjacency tunnel <number> detail** command).

* CSCuc59991

Symptom: The traceback may appear in applying or removing Cisco Application Visibility and Control configuration.

Conditions: The traceback may appear in a very rare condition of massive applying or removing Cisco Application Visibility and Control configuration sequence.

Workaround: In case of traceback, remove the configuration and reapply it again.

* CSCuc62212

Symptom:  **sh pla so ob fp active pending-ack-update** output hw dirty-bit has error.

Conditions: There are no specific conditions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc65424

Symptom: On dual RP configurations, a standby route processor might crash when establishing new interfaces (could be PPP sessions).

Conditions: This symptom is observed when IDB reuse is turned on on a dual RP configuration, and when some interfaces are deleted and created again.

Workaround: Turn off the IDB reuse option.

* CSCuc67116

Symptom: IPSec SA reset when sequence number rolls over back to 0 with anti-reply disable.

Conditions: OUT\_OCT\_DETECT\_SEQ\_OVEFLOW counter increase.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc70310

Symptom: RRI routes are not installed in DMAP.  **reverse-route** is a configuration in the DMAP. This prevents packets from being routed through the intended interface, and hence packet loss occurs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when a simple reverse-route is configured in DMAP without any gateway options.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc70578

Symptom: While clearing the counters, the following error message is seen:

 `%IOSXE-3-PLATFORM: R0/0: kernel: /scratch/mcpre/BLD-BLD_V153_1_S_XE38_THROTTLE_LATEST_20121015_080026/os/linux/drivers/binos/i2c/psmcu/psmcu_main.c:read_from_psmcu (line 185): i2c_smbus_read_byte() returned -110 Other potential errors: %IOSXE-3-PLATFORM: R0/0: kernel: /auto/mcpbuilds13/release/03.08.00.S/BLD-03.08.00.S/os/linux/drivers/binos/i2c/psmcu/psmcu_main.c:read_from_psmcu (line 175): MCU set pointer command failed, -5`.

Conditions: Error message seen while clearing the counters.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc72643

Symptom: Periodic memory leak occurs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed periodically.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc73993

Symptom: High PPS of single flow traffic may reduce the overall system performance by 90%.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when there is very large PPS of single flow traffic, and when NBAR is enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc74857

Symptom: NAT address pool exhaustion with high DNS traffic.

Conditions: Payload addresses in DNS PTR record natted without active NAT bindings. RFC 2694 suggests that DNS PTR queries should not be translated if no active bindings are found in the NAT translation table. Per current implementation, new NAT dynamic bindings are created when processing DNS PTR queries, eventually contributing to NAT address pool exhaustion.

Workaround: 1. Add deny ACL to avoid NAT translation of unknown payload addresses in the DNS PTR query. 2. Turn off dns alg service if possible.

* CSCuc76130

Symptom: IPsec SAs are not getting deleted even after removing ACL.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you use the IPsec feature with Cisco IOS Release 15.3(0.18)T0.1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc76566

Symptom: The  **show platform hardware qfp active feature ess session** command is supposed to display a list of features enabled on each session. The status of the FFR feature is not displayed.

Conditions: It affects debuggability of mobility IP sessions on iWAG.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc77704

Symptom: The GETVPN/GDOI Secondary Cooperative Key Server (COOP-KS) does not download the policy (that is, when the show crypto gdoi ks policy command is issued on the Secondary COOP-KS and the command output shows that no policy is downloaded) and Group Members (GMs) registering to the Secondary COOP-KS fail to register without any warning/error message.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the GETVPN/GDOI group (with COOP configured) has an IPsec profile configured with one of the following transforms in its transform-set: - esp-sha256-hmac - esp-sha384-hmac - esp-sha512-hmac.

Workaround: Use esp-sha-hmac as the authentication transform instead.

* CSCuc78499

Symptom: GTPv1 memory chunk leak.

Conditions: GTP AIC is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc78702

Symptom:  `%NAT: VRF ID 2385 does not exist` seen in the output of  **show run vrf** .

Conditions: If a VRF is defined without configuring an address-family, then this message may be displayed when the user issues a  **show running vrf** command.

Workaround: The show command output is still valid. This has no impact on the functionality.

* CSCuc79208

Symptom: Error  `%Port <>` is being used by system. When configuring static nat with the same ports for different IP addresses as shown below, you may see following error message: `"%Port 1720 is being used by system" : ip nat inside source list IP_PBX_MP_NAT_ACL_PUB interface Loopback12 overload ip nat inside source list IP_PBX_MP_NAT_ACL_SUB interface Loopback13 overload ip nat inside source static tcp 161.92.7.42 1720 interface Loopback12 1720 ip nat inside source static tcp 161.92.7.43 1720 interface Loopback13 1720.` This issue occurs when you have NAT with overload statements configured before you configure static NAT for ports.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when NAT with overload statements are configured first.

Workaround: Remove all NAT statements and configure static NAT before NAT overload. (You may see the failure again at reload time since the commands are nvgenned with the overload command first.)

* CSCuc80725

Symptom:  **vfr subblock** remains without displaying the  **ip virual-reassembly**  command.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you enable NAT and  **no vfr**, and re-enable  **vfr**.

Workaround: Enable **no vfr**  manually.

* CSCuc81645

Symptom: Execute the show command and cpp crashes on overlord.

Conditions: None.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc81662

Symptom: ISR4451 Router doesn't boot properly. The slot F0 stays in init state.

Conditions: This symptom is observed just after a power cycle. This condition is rare and is seen once every few hundred power cycles.

Workaround: Power cycle the router, a soft reload will not clear this issue.

* CSCuc85002

Symptom: Unexpected logs printed in the console during configuration.

 `*Oct 17 06:54:50.711: %FMFP-3-OBJ_DWNLD_TO_CPP_FAILED: F1: fman_fp_image: PORTLIST: (tcp/50.1.1.1 port 4096 - 5119) download to CPP failed *Oct 17 06:54:50.534: %FMFP-3-OBJ_DWNLD_TO_CPP_FAILED: F0: fman_fp_image: PORTLIST: (tcp/50.1.1.1 port 4096 - 5119) download to CPP failed`.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when the configuration includes dynamic PAT (port address translation) with interface overload.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc85807

Symptom: In cases where MMON is activated on non-video UDP, traffic jitter values of certain flows may have incorrect jitter values.

Conditions: Non video and/or UDP traffic is being injected to the MMON engine. It may also happen to video traffic before it is classified as such (first few packets) - this is self corrective. This is unlikely to happen since usually MMON is enabled on specific media flows.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc87847

Symptom: QFP crashes.

Conditions: Packets are replicated and field  **in\_interface** in  **pkt\_state** is invalid.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc88175

Symptom: When a dynamic cryptomap is used on the Virtual Template interface, SAs do not get created and thus the testscripts fail. This issue occurs because the crypto map configurations are not added to the NVGEN, and there is no security policy applied on the Virtual Template interface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only when a dynamic map is used on the Virtual Template interface. However, this issue is not seen when tunnel protection is used on the Virtual Template interface or when a dynamic map is used on the typical physical interface.

Workaround: Use tunnel protection on the Virtual Template interface.

* CSCuc89646

Symptom: When TCP SYN packet is sent with no MSS specified, the default value is set to 0, not 536, as on other platforms.

Conditions: TCP SYN packet is sent with no MSS specified.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc89800

Symptom: ESP crashes when it receives a for\_us packet with multiple (thousands of) tunnel headers.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in a scenario where there are three routers, A, B, and C, and there is a tunnel T1 between A and C. In router A, a PBR transmits the packets from B through T1. In router B, a default route points to router A. Router A then transmits a packet through the T1 tunnel, encapsulated with a GRE header. When this packet arrives at router B, due to the flapping of route between B and C, it is not sent to router C. Instead, it is sent to router A because router A is the default route. When the packet arrives at router A, it is transmitted through the T1 tunnel again encapsulated with another GRE header. This cycle continues and the packets are encapsulated with thousands of GRE headers. Finally, when the route between B and C no longer flaps, it arrives at router C, causing it to crash.

Workaround: Configure an ACL in router C's tunnel T1 interface, and deny the packet if it has an inner header with the same src addr and dst addr with outer the header. But this workaround cannot cover the scenario that has an attack packet encapsulated with multiple different tunnel headers.

* CSCuc92567

Symptom: SIP may reload during MDR due to ESI reconciliation failure with active ESP.

Conditions: Extremely rare race condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc93053

Symptom: WCCP stops working after adding ZBF. We see a message of WCCP packets being redirected but not leaving ASR.

Conditions: ASR with netflow anf ZBF enabled under the same interfaces.

Workaround: Disable netflow on all the interfaces.

* CSCuc93807

Symptom: Metrics that require AOR are not accounted correctly. (for example: ART metrics, packet/bytes counter and so on.)

Conditions: 1. Performance policy map is configured with parameter default account-on-resolution property. 2. At least one NBAR filter is presented in one of the class-maps of the policy-map. 3. Packets are matched by the class-map without any monitor.

Workaround: Add a flow monitor (even without an exporter) to the class-default.

* CSCuc95192

Symptom: Ucode Crash Seen.

Conditions: Unconfigure/Configure static NAT in B2BHA setup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc97477

Symptom: This is a new feature for dummy packet support.

Conditions: None.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc98107

Symptom: The performance of urpf with acl gets downgraded.

Conditions: The downgrading is found on Release 15.3(01)S onwards.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc97789

Symptom: The hostname reporting is not supported.

Conditions: It is observed when the AVC URL tool is configured and the http traffic sends the hostname that are not reported.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud01905

Symptom: Match not apn is not working.

Conditions: Basic gtp message flow.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud03863

Symptom: ESP crashes on CSR.

Conditions: Crash occurs when sending traffic through a non gig 0 interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud04066

Symptom: CPP CVLA traceback appears.

Conditions: This may occur during monitor configuration rollback when configuration fails.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud05368

Symptom: Traffic will be redirected to WCCP client even when it is defined as deny in wccp redirect ACL.

Conditions: WCCP on ASR1k.

Workaround: There can be two workarounds: 1. Move the deny entries before the permits when possible (especially for deny... host...), but it still may not work in some situations. 2. Use different redirect ACLs for each service, and remove the unnecessary ones for specific services.

* CSCud06852

Symptom: T1 Controller will not be marked as DOWN when there are alarms after the RP Switchover.

Conditions: RP Switchover.

Workaround: SPA Soft OIR.

* CSCud06887

Symptoms: IPsec Stateful failover is configured between two routers. router 1 is chosen as Active. router 2 is chosen as Standby. router 3 acts as the VPN end peer. A VPN tunnel is created between the VIP of routers 1 and 2 and router 3. SPIs are replicated from Active (router 1) to Standby (router 2). After switchover from Active to Standby (done by reload of Active router 1), router 2 becomes Active and takes over the VPN connection. Router 1 comes up after manual reload and then reloads again by itself. When router 1 comes up after the second reload, SPIs are not replicated from Active router 2.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when IPsec Stateful failover is configured on Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M1. This issue is seen when the HW crypto engine is enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud79391

Symptom: Some AVC functions (performance monitor and media-net) are missing from the advipservices image. They are included only on the adventerprise image.

Conditions: After loading an advipservices image, some AVC functionality could not be configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud12022

Symptom: The over-subscription of a SPA buffer causes a message to be logged; indicating packet drops in the SPA.

Conditions: This issue occurs during re-configuration, flow-control is not set correctly on the ESP and results in a broken flow-control on the interface that is re-configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud14033

Symptom: Traceback appears and the packet is dropped with uRPF specific cause.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the uRPF and ACL configurations are removed and added while the traffic is running, copy remove\_config running and copy add\_config running.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud16127

Symptom: The CPC request message is passed by AIC and sent to another side.

Conditions: The issue occurs because of an invalid IMSI.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud16274

Symptom: The CPP is crashed with core dump file and traceback.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the session setup rate is 10.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud21267

Symptom: Accesses to the midplane EERPOM or power supply may fail.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the systems have dual RPs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud21578

Symptom: The ASR 1000 router with iWAG feature running Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)S may fail to establish a GTPv1 tunnel with ASR 5000 platform if MSISDN is not provided in the required format, that is with leading 19.

Conditions: This failure occurs when the MSISDN in cisco-msisdn attribute from AAA server does not have 19 as Numbering Plan Indicator and Nature of Address for GTPv1.

Workaround: Provision at AAA server to send MSISDN with first two digits as 19.

* CSCud22437

Symptom: An ASR 1K might experience a watchdog crash due to a kernel panic. After viewing the plaintext contents of the resultant kernel core file that is generated, iosd generates a watchdog because of a soft lockup that prevents it from responding within 60 seconds:  `<3>BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 61s! [linux_iosd-imag:26869]`

Conditions: There is no particular condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud24321

Symptom: The interface hierarchy gets corrupted during OIR such that subsequent reconfiguration events lead to a system crash.

Impacted Platforms: ESP-100 and VXE-2, also known as Yoda platforms.

Not Impacted Platforms: All CPP10 platforms, that is, ESP-10, ESP-20, ESP-40, etc. It also does not impact overlord and ultra

Conditions: The issue occurs when:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The FRF.12 P3 queue is not removed from the interface during OIR

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The code assumes all features have been removed from the interface before the default queue is removed.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The default queue is re-added while the P3 is already active and its sub-hierarchy is built on top of the leaf node for the P3 queue. This causes the hierarchy to grow exponentially to a point where programming the hardware fails.

Workaround: Removing the FRF.12 before OIR and reapplying it after OIR should work whether done manually or through a script. However, it is unreliable in the real world where OIR could occur due to swapping out one SPA for another unless the user remembers to disable FRF.12 before swapping the SPAs.

* CSCud24885

Symptom: When some drops are seen: FirewallInvalidZoneable.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the ASR with WCCP, ZBF, and netflow are configured at the same time.

Workaround: Ping the destination on Cisco ASR1000 series router before introducing the WCCP traffic.

* CSCud30024

Symptom: Packet drop may be observed during IP Security (IPSec) rekey.

Conditions: The issue occurs on a Cisco ASR1000 series router when it functions as an IPSec termination and aggregation router, and when Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) is used. The packet drop, due to invalid SPI, may occur on responder router during rekey.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud31542

Symptom: The DHCP reply message is dropped in the data plane after RPSO or clear IPv6 neighbor.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Setup of DHCPv6 binding.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Clear IPv6 neighbor or RPSO and without traffic before adjacency convergence, then DHCP reply message will be dropped in the data plane.

Workaround: There are several workarounds:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Send downstream traffic to client which will relearn the neighbor.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Clear IPv6 route  `X::X/prefix <dhcp installing route>` to relearn the neighbor.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Client can reconnect after the DHCP session is timeout.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Client can send RS or NS.

* CSCud34131

Symptom: ERSPAN can only monitor ZBFW interface Rx packets.

Conditions: The issue occurs when ERSPAN packets are dropped if the ERSPAN output interface is not in the same zone as that of monitor interface.

Workaround: Configure the ERSPAN output interface in the same zone as that of monitored interface.

* CSCud35550

Symptom: Many trace backs are printed in the console when GTPv2 messages are handled.

Conditions: Attached configuration is imported. It can also be triggered, if layer 7 drop is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud35735

Symptom: ucode along with fman\_fp core seen in UUT with GTP\_AIC\_FUNC\_POLICY\_CHANGE.

Conditions: The issue occurs while sending traffic from SGSN.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud37568

Symptom: Memory leak in GTP PDP pool.

Conditions: The issue occurs when GTP AIC is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud37921

Symptom: Communication broken. Update PDP Context Requests are dropped, if GSN address is not identical with the GSN address provided in Create PDP Context Request.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the 3GPP communication on GRX interface. Roaming mobile users from GRX to inside can have different GSN address information.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud38010

Symptom: Due to the change of CSCud35735: ASR1K: ucode crash at gtp\_aic\_match\_policy. It is a defense for smtp aic, as the function call re\_multi\_match\_ascii can result in crash.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the function re\_multi\_match\_ascii meet some invalid array address, which will return 0xFFFFFFFF as the match length, here in smtp aic, it must be protected from this exception.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud38558

Symptom: The two causes are:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Might be no monitoring.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Trackback message appears in log: 1#7e4ed294e9cee774e6d357fbecf1228d errmsg:CB20000 2230 cpp\_common\_os:D1AD000 BBB0 cpp\_common\_os:D1AD000 B9C0 cpp\_common\_os:D1AD000 1903C cpp\_fnf\_svr\_lib:FE68000 15D64 cpp\_fnf\_svr\_lib:FE68000 1C2D0 cpp\_fnf\_svr\_lib:FE68000 18E84 cpp\_common\_os:D1AD000 10A94 cpp\_common\_os:D1AD000 110CC evlib:CEF1000 E0DC evlib:CEF1000 104C4 cpp\_common\_os:D1AD000 127E8:10000000 4710 c:A526000 1E938 c:A526000 1EAE0.

Conditions: The issue occurs:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) On 3.8 Ver: Happens randomly if HTTP tool is deployed several times.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) On 3.7 Ver: Happens randomly if AVC1.5 tool is deployed several times.

Workaround: Reapply the configuration.

* CSCud39324

Symptom: Due to the reloading of the ESP.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the ASCII ALG traffic requiring TCP seq or delta fixup on payload length change due to address translation. This reload could occur rarely with very long lived TCP connections.

Workaround: Turn off the ALG that is causing the issue.

* CSCud39590

Symptom: This is a new feature for dummy packet support.

Conditions: There is no particular condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud40015

Symptom: The client or server IPs are interchanged in command  **sh serv-in statis conn** on Peer ACs.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the client or server IPs are interchanged in CLI  **sh serv-in statis conn on Peer AC's.** When there are 4 AC's in an ACG and the context is up and operational, some traffic is sent and only one AC owns that flow. If the command  **sh service-inse statis conn is executed**  on the AC which owns the flow, it shows the right output. But when the same command is executed on the other AC's the client and server IP’s are interchanged.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud41480

Symptom: The QFP is reloaded.

Conditions: The known conditions for this are to have one Firewall and NAT configured on a ASR1002-X, but crash is intermittent.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud41501

Symptom: The first and last timestamps shown in the output of  **show flow monitor <name> cache** command shows incorrect values on an ASR1K with RP1 route processors.

Conditions: The following are the conditions for this symptom:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Attach a record that contains  **timestamp sys-uptime first** and / or  **timestamp sys-uptime last** field(s) to a monitor. Predefined records such as  **netflow-original** already have these fields defined.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Under the interface config mode, configure the above defined monitor using  **[ip | ipv6 | mpls]**  **flow monitor <name> (sampler) [input | output].**

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Issue the following show command  **show flow monitor <name> cache**  to see the cached records.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) In the output of the above show command, the values displayed for the first and last timestamp fields can be incorrect.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud42919

Symptom: FP crash.

Conditions: The issue occurs when there is 70~80K translation sessions, SIP and H323 mixed traffic.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud44854

Symptom: The Hash table has not been memset for ALG during initialization.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) start  **sip/h323/...** traffic

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Established NAT session over 60~70K

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Send CLI combinations with below actions:

* clear  **ip nat trans \***
* shutdown inside or outside traffic interfaces
* remove  **nat/alg config**
* **reconfig**  **nat/alg** and unshut interfaces

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud45750

Symptom: Extended data forwarding outage when MLPPPOLNS session is forwarded to a new link due to a OSPF link.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the MLPPPOLNS session is defined using a member link session with multiple paths to the destination LAC through OSPF, if the member link session interface changes after the session is active, a extended data forwarding outage may occur due to the OSPF link change. Possible MLPPP member link session flap may also occur.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

* CSCud47046

Symptom: No-way voice occurs after transferring external calls to an external recipient. The PBX does a external transfer and uses a new transaction leg which indicates that media should be hair pinned on the SBC, but no media is heard.  `PBX(A)----SIP-----SBC(B)----SIP-----service-provider(C)`

The following are the different Call Scenario:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PBX(A) user dials external party (towards C) the calls is answered.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PBX(A) user presses the conference/transfer key which places the call on hold. MOH is heard by the external party.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PBX(A) user dials external party (towards c) and the call is answered.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PBX(A) user completes the call transfer.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The call transfer is completed, but no audio is heard, by either A or B.

Conditions: The issue occurs only when all of the below conditions happen together:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) One side has  **nat** enabled and  **rtp** comes before  **sdp** offer/answer is completed.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Four calls are modified to two hair pin call sets, that is two calls are hair pined.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Later call modification makes four calls hair pined together.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud49494

Symptom: While receiving the udp fragmented packets, ESP is crashed with multicast service reflect being configured.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the multicast service reflect is configured and udp fragments are received in the VIF interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud49777

Symptom: In a Flex scale setup, few of the framed routes do not get installed even though all the sessions come up fine. As a result, traffic flow is affected.

Conditions: The issue occurs while clearing the crypto session on the headend. Sessions will be triggered again from SVTI. For few of the sessions, framed route is not installed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud50827

Symptom: The protocol pack upgrade or loading fails, with the following error message:  **failed add new signature to heuristic signature**.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the simple protocol pack upgrade, path (starting PP 3.1).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Symptom: The FNF monitor with application name key does not report HTTP host name.

Conditions: The issue occurs in the FNF monitor with  **match application name account-on-resolution**.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud53401

Symptom: The router crashes due to a hardware interrupt.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the FRF.12 is configured on ESP100 or 1RUVE2, the recycle queue cannot be changed on-the-fly because of the packets in-flight that is enqueued to this queue by the hardware.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud58038

Symptom: The router crashes due to a hardware interrupt.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) setup sip/h323 traffic

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) shut and unshut clear ip nat tr \*

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) remove ip nat, shut clear ip nat tr \*

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud60014

Symptom: The control process crashes during reconfiguration on ESP100 or 1ruve2.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the reconfiguration such as adding a hierarchical policy to an ATM, changing a class-of-service for an ATM VC, and so on, which results in a new scheduling hierarchy.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud61316

Symptom: The vTCP reset storm is observed in NAT/ALG back-to-back deployment.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A TCP NAT session is established between two ASR1K.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Abnormal ALG packets are received from both the sides.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) An additional TCP segment is received by ASR 1K after ASR1K sends out the TCP RST.

Workaround: Manually clear the affected NAT session.

* CSCud66316

Symptom: Log messages for REJECT Create Session Response is not printed in sys-log.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the GTP AIC is configured in the UUT.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud67970

Symptom: Provisioned QoS service is not honored.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the fair-queue is removed from the class on-the-fly, the rates, that is, bandwidth and shape, are no longer configured in the hardware.

Workaround: Remove the fair-queue class and re-add it without the fair-queue.

* CSCud70243

Symptom: Some IPv6 subscribers fail to come up in a scenario in which there is a frequent session churn.

Conditions: The issue occurs on an ASR 1K router, for IPv6 subscribers that have traffic classes configured. It occurs when the sessions are torn down soon after coming up. It can also involve a change to a session's complement of traffic classes shortly after coming up, but before being torn down. A number of pending objects can register in the output of the show platform software object-manager fp active statistics command.

Workaround: Remove the pending objects by performing an FP switchover on ASR 1K routers that have two of them. Before performing an FP switchover, make sure that there are not any pending objects on the standby FP. This can be determined by using the command show platform software object-manager fp standby statistics. If the standby FP has pending object counts when the system is in steady-state, it should be reloaded and checked for pending objects after it comes back. If the new pending object counts reach is 0, then proceed with an FP switchover.

* CSCud72509

Symptom: The ESP100 is crashed.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the NAT is configured, TCP segments size is larger then 26K, ESP100, or 1002-X.

Workaround: Add no payload-option in the nat entry to disable all alg or disable a specific DNS tcp alg by using the command no ip nat service dns tcp.

* CSCud73594

Symptom: The MMA objects are not removed after policy detach. This is seen with the following CLI command: show platform software object-manager fp active object-type-count | inc mma. Eventually, this can lead to a failure in applying a Seawolf configuration.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the massive sequence of policy attach or detach operations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud73599

Symptom: No records are generated after several configurations.

Conditions: The issue occurs when there is a config replace or any other massive performance policy configurations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud73600

Symptom: The FP is crashed.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the QoS is configured on physical interface which is bind to a BDI interface. Stile is configured on the same BDI interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Stile is not supported on BDI interfaces and must not be configured on it.

---

* CSCud73652

Symptom: Incorrect MMON/ART metrics reported and/or crash.

Conditions: The issue occurs in some rare cases, when:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Packets of the same flow are processed by FME on more than one interfaces.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) FME processes from the second interface and continues further, ends due to some error (rare case).

Workaround: There is no workaround

* CSCud75024

Symptom: The ESP cpp\_cp\_svr process crashes, with the trace back pointing to the cpp\_ess\_ea\_ffr\_entry\_free function.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the session teardown.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud77695

Symptom: The security policy is not downloaded to the data path correctly.

Conditions: The issue occurs on a Cisco ASR1000 series router when it functions as an IP Security (IPSec) termination and aggregation router, and when IPv6 static crypto map with large Access Control list Elements (ACEs) are configured within a single Access Control list (ACL).

Workaround: The issue can be avoided by:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Applying the IPv6 static crypto map with initial ACL containing less than 10 ACEs.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Adding the ACEs, one-by-one, into the ACL configuration.

* CSCud78618

Symptom: Crash.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the iVRF is configured on the ike profile.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud78649

Symptom: An error message SBC: SBC ^T^U^\V is not configured is printed when activating sbc.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the activate command is Run just after the command media-address ipv4...

 `ASR-1001-CCN-7(config)#sbc test ASR-1001-CCN-7(config-sbc)#sbe ASR-1001-CCN-7(config-sbc-sbe)#media-address ipv4 1.20.0.2 vrf vrfa ASR-1001-CCN-7(config-sbc-media-address)#activate SBC: SBC ^A^T not configured.`

Workaround: exit sbc, and enter sbc again, then Run the activate command.

* CSCud79391

Symptom: The AVC functionality (performance monitor and media-net) is missing from advipservices image. It was only present in adventerprise.

Conditions: The issue occurs when loading an advipservices image, AVC functionality can not be configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud80832

Symptom: The ASR 1000 router can result in a ucode crash when the box is running NAT with oer keyword and also running PfR.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the NAT is configured with the oer keyword on NAT mapping and PfR is used for traffic optimization, doing a shut or no shut on a PfR external link also happens to be the NAT outside interface, which can result in a crash if the traffic is flowing.

Workaround: Avoid doing a manual shut or no shut on the PfR external interfaces when running with NAT. If you must do a shut or no shut, shut down the NAT inside the interface first, then do a clean ip nat trans \* and then shut the PfR interface.

* CSCud86240

Symptom: The ASR1K ESP crashes (ucode core file created) when compressed packets are sent on a Multilink PPP interface using IOS XE 3.5 and earlier ASR1K software images. On IOS XE3.6 and later ASR1K software images a crash does not occur, but routed traffic on configured interfaces are not forwarded. But, local traffic between the peer routers can be forwarded. In all releases, routed traffic will be dropped on any other interfaces (for example, PPP, Multilink PPP, HDLC, and so on.) configured for this mode of compression.

Conditions: The issue occurs if the legacy IOS compression feature compress [mppc | stac | predictor] is configured on any interface (for example, PPP, Multilink PPP, HDLC, and so on.). If this feature is configured on a Multilink PPP interface then the ESP crash can be encountered if using an IOS XE3.5 or earlier ASR1K software image.

Workaround: Remove the compress [mppc | stac | predictor] feature configuration from all interfaces as this functionality is not supported on the ASR1K. The software fix associated with this bug report will be removing this configuration option from the ASR1K.

* CSCud88366

Symptom: Kingpin: plim tx drop if gi0/0/0 is used as tunnel source physical interface.

Conditions: The issue occurs when Gige interface as SVT tunnel source interface and 4K QoS policy is applied to 4K SVTI tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud88517

Symptom: The system is out-of-service.

Conditions: The issue is observed on a Cisco ASR1000 series router when it functions as an IP Security (IPSec) termination and aggregation router, and when more than 30 IPSec sessions are up and running traffic.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud90021

Symptom: An ASR1K running 03.06.00.S.152-2.S can crash due to a NAT bind age timing.

Conditions: This issue is a rare timing condition which is triggered by the RG infra toggle.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud90142

Symptom: The GTPv2 drop counter increments, when actually, no messages are dropped.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the cause value in Create Session Response is 78.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud91102

Symptom: Router reload.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the heavy AVC traffics.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud91877

Symptom: Cannot include "." in the variable name, used in header editor.

Conditions: The issue occurs always.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud91920

Symptom: When configuring an ACL for both IPv4 and IPv6 in a policy-map, the policy-map does not work properly.

Conditions: The issue occurs when an ACL is configured for both IPv4 and IPv6 in a policy-map and when the policy-map is attached to an interface or control-plane.

Workaround: Use IPv4 ACL and IPv6 ACL in a same class-map with match-any.

* CSCud92837

Symptom: The aggregation-type prefix-length of PfR cannot be configured to less than 16. If so, the number of learned prefix will be much less than what it must be.

Conditions: The issue occurs when PfR is enabled.

Workaround: It is better to configure the aggregation-type prefix-length of PfR to greater than 24.

* CSCud92879

Symptom: The current session for control plane is too small.

Conditions: The issue occurs during the basic GTPv1 configuration, and GTPv1 traffic.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue15619

Symptom: SBC CLI hung.

Conditions: The issue occurs while configuring the signaling-peer-port when the adj is attached, the new vty terminal would be hung.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue17371

Symptom: NTE cannot pass through.

Conditions: The issue occurs for a transcoding call.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

## Caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S

This section describes the caveats in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S. It contains the following topics:

* [Open Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S](/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_rel_notes/asr1k_caveats_38s.html#13022)
* [Resolved Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S](/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_rel_notes/asr1k_caveats_38s.html#97807)

### Open Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S

This section documents the unexpected behavior that might be seen in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S.

* CSCtr38540

Symptom: In the Cisco ASR 1001 Router, false temperature readings from the power supply similar as the one displayed here, are reported:

 `June 18 03:36:37.700:%ENVIRONMENTAL-1-ALERT: Temp: Inlet, Location: P1, State: Shutdown, Reading: 127 Celsius`

Conditions: This is seen only on the Cisco ASR 1001 Router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua99781

Symptom: The ESP gets reloaded.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you issue the  **clear crypto session** command with the 4k IKEv2 IPv6 static crypto map tunnels and bidirectional traffic of 2Gbps 300B packets.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc74857

Symptom: NAT address pool exhaustion occurs with high DNS traffic.

Conditions: Payload addresses in DNS PTR record natted without active NAT bindings. RFC 2694 suggests that DNS PTR queries should not be translated if no active bindings are found in the NAT translation table. Per current implementation, new NAT dynamic bindings are created when processing DNS PTR queries, eventually contributing to NAT address pool exhaustion.

Workaround:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Add deny ACL to avoid NAT translation of unknown payload addresses in the DNS PTR query.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Turn off DNS ALG service if possible.

* CSCud00613

Symptom: The physical interface goes down in the shutdown state when you load the configuration on a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router.

Conditions: The IP address of default gateway under GTP should not overlap with any of the existing interface configurations. If it does, the Cisco IOS software will shut down the interfaces that have overlapping IP addresses. The iWAG creates a virtual interface based on the IP address provided under the GTP or the APN default gateway configuration as follows:

gtp

apn 1

default-gw 192.168.10.1 prefix-len 16 <virtual-interface will be created with ip address 192.168.10.1>

Workaround: If you configure similar interfaces, you have to unconfigure the entire GTP configuration using the  **no gtp** command, go to either the physical interface or the loopback interface, perform a  **no shut** action, and reconfigure the interface using the  **gtp** command.

* CSCud15949

Symptom: The CPP traceback notifying monitor cannot be reserved.

Conditions: The issue was seen when the MMA policy, mediatrace policy, and one FNF monitor were attached to an interface.

Workaround: If the FNF monitor is configured, only one policy may be attached on the interface and direction. This should not exceed the following:

num\_of\_policies\*5 + num\_of\_fnf\_monitors > 10.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S

This section documents the resolved issues in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release 3.8S.

* CSCsd20055

Symptom: The DHCP client is not installing a default route if the physical interface is assigned to a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: Manually configure a static default route in VRF.

* CSCso75347

Symptom: When the cable dhcp-giaddr policy strict command is configured on the Cisco CMTS, the CPEs behind the CMs are expected to get the DHCPOFFER message with its source IP address belonging to secondary IP Network Address range of the downstream cable interface in the CMTS. Currently, the DHCPOFFER has the source IP address from the downstream's primary IP network address range.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the cable dhcp-giaddr policy strict command is configured in the CMTS cable downstream interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCsq83006

Symptom: When some port channels go down at the same time on a router, it can cause EIGRP SIA errors.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with full mesh four routers that are connected via port channels. Additionally, it occurs with over five routers that are connected via a partial mesh port channel.

Workaround: Use the following port-channel interface settings:

(config)# **interface port-channel <***port-channel-interface-number***>**

(config-if)# **bandwidth <***bandwidth-value***>**

(config-if)# delay < *delay-value* >

* CSCsr03117

Symptom: The UDP direct-broadcast packets get dropped even if the ACL is configured to permit this traffic.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

 Workaround: Configure the ACL statement as permit ip X.X.X.X X.X.X.X host 255.255.255.255.

* CSCsv08144

Symptom: Even if the MLPPP LFI is correctly configured on a multilink interface, the  **show ppp multilink** command continues to show interleaving as disabled.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregate Services Router has PPP multilink interleave configured on the multilink interface on the multilink virtual template (for broadband MLPPP).

Workaround: The  **show plat hard qfp act feat mlp data bundle**   *<full-bundle-interface name>*   **detail** command shows the correct status of the interleaving on the interface.

* CSCsz65576

Symptom: One or more linecards may fail to boot in a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregate Services Router with an RP2 may occur, or an error with the  `EOBC. %CMFP-3-STANDBY_EOBC_LINK_ERROR: F0: cman_fp: Standby EOBC link` error detected.

Conditions: This symptom is only seen with certain combinations of RP2 and ESP10.

Workaround: There is no workaround, but the issue is not seen with an ESP20.

* CSCtd43540

Symptom: A memory leak occurs at  `cdp_handle_version_info`.

Conditions: This symptom is triggered by misbehavior of peer switch running Cisco IOS Release 12.2(46)SE that has been fixed in CSCsm63025. The symptom is observed with link flapping.

Workaround: Disable CDP on the flapping interface.

* CSCtd54694

Symptom: A crash is seen when the  **show cdp neighbor port-channel** no and the  **show cdp neighbor port-channel** no  **de?** commands are executed.

Conditions: It is a rare timing issue.

Workaround: Use the show cdp neighbor and show cdp neighbor detail command to view both the brief and detailed CDP information respectively as a workaround. Also, the show cdp neighbor <interface type> no command can be used except when the interface type is port-channel.

* CSCtd58886

Symptom: The CMTS crashes when the SNMP client enquires  `ifRcvAddressEntry` that contains a non-zero address of a GE interface in the SPA.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco uBR10000 Router with a 5GE SPA that runs Cisco IOS Release 12.2SCB or 12.2SCC with the following SNMP command:

 **getnext -v2c** < *cmts address>*  **[**  *community* ]  **ifRcvAddressStatus/**  **ifRcvAddressType**.< *ifIndex of GE in SPA*. *non-zero address>*

Workaround: Do not query this entry of the table since it does not exist.

* CSCtg39957

Symptom: Spurious memory access occurs during the  `tspts_handle_rsvp_pathtail_events` function.

Conditions: This issue occurs when a PATH message without any session attribute object is being received from the TE head end. Note that the Cisco IOS and Cisco XR routers always send the session attribute object.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtg47129

Symptom: Memory leaks are observed on the Cisco CMTS router when NAT is configured.

Conditions: This issue is observed in the context of packets that need NAT in a VPN Routing and Forwarding (VRF) environment.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCth15357

Symptom: You are allowed to configure a  `max-threshold`  value higher that is than the configured queue-limit even when the  `max-threshold` value cannot exceed the configured queue limit value.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in Cisco routers loaded with Cisco IOS version 15.1(2.1)T.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCth16914

Symptom: Allocated memory not accounted for in the MLP client.

Conditions: This issue occurs during power up.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCth71093

Symptom: Routers that are configured to dump core to  `flash:` or  `flash0:` fail to dump correctly to the 4GB compact flash card.

Conditions: This is observed in the  `exception flash all flash`  configuration.When you issue a wr core command, it fails to dump the core files.

Workaround: Dump cores to the TFTP.

* CSCti31463

Symptom: The Cisco IOS route does not store more than two classless static routes learned through DHCP option 121.

Conditions: Current implementation supports only two static routes.

Workaround: Statically configure the routes.

* CSCti62247

Symptom: If an IPv4 or IPv6 packet is sent to a null interface, a Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Router does not respond with an ICMP or ICMPv6 packet.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with a prefix routed to the Null0 interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtk15666

Symptom: Cisco IOS password length is limited to 25 characters.

Conditions: Cisco IOS password length is limited to 25 characters on NG3K products.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCto43670

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Router crashes while running the  **show running-config** command after configuring the replicate route with forward-referenced VRFs.

Conditions: This issue occurs only when route-replicate configurations include forward-referenced VRFs, that is, VRFs are not defined at the time of route-replicate configuration, and the replicate route is configured using the  **topology** subcommand of the  **global-address-family ipv4 multicast**  command.

Workaround: Run the  **show running-config** command after defining the forward-referenced VRFs.

* CSCto73799

Symptom: Standby RP bulk synchronization modifies certain multiline commands in the process of loading the active RP running configuration.

Conditions: Banner and refuse message commands that have the opening ^C on the command line followed by some characters before the first new line and further input, can result in the standby inserting an extra new line into the standby configuration between the ^C and the content that is supposed to appear on the first line. The **shell map** and **macro auto** commands that have multiple unmatched closing braces in their multiline input will be misread, such that the resulting command is interpreted by the standby as invalid. If the active is configured to reload the standby on invalid commands, the standby RP will be reloaded as a result.

Workaround: Format the commands in such a way that these conditions are avoided. If the chosen formatting produces visible symptoms on the standby, adjust the formatting, save the configuration, reload the standby and verify that the symptoms have been cleared from the standby's running-configuration.

* CSCto75838

Symptom: Opening client sockets to IPv4 addresses fail with an invalid argument error message.

Conditions: This issue only occurs with IPv4 sockets. IPv6 sockets work properly.

Workaround: Use the IPv6 client connections.

* CSCto87436

Symptom: Under certain conditions, Cisco IOS devices may crash, and the following error message appears:

 `%SYS-2-WATCHDOG: Process aborted on watchdog timeout, process = SSH Proc`

Conditions: If an SSH connection to a Cisco IOS device is slow or idle, it may cause a box to crash with an error message.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtq24011

Symptom: Routers behave in a way similar to when a local-proxy-arp is configured on them and perform a proxy-arp even for the systems in the same subnet.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Router receives an ARP request on an interface when the interface is not fully initialized, and the connected routes are not added to the routing table yet. This causes the proxy-arp reply and wrong arp entry to freeze.

Workaround: Perform shut or no shut on victim and offender routers.

* CSCtq64716

Symptom: The following warning message may be displayed during router boot even when the server is defined:  `%RADIUS-4-NOSERVNAME`

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtq94843

Symptom: An IP prefix list entry exists even after unconfiguring the prefix list.

Conditions: This issue is seen when a prefix list that is the last one being configured is deleted by deleting individual entries. However, the prefix list can still be displayed with  **show** commands.

Workaround: Configure a new prefix list or an existing prefix list.

* CSCtr45030

Symptom: The SNMP timers causes the Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Router to exit the global configuration mode or prevents the console from entering the global configuration mode.

Conditions: Occurs when you copy and paste large configurations, particularly a large number of VLAN configurations. The issue occurs without any SNMP configurations present.

Workaround: Perform the following workarounds:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable RMON.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If the configuration is huge, paste in multiple blocks.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enable SNMP timers. Paste the required configuration when the timer callbacks have finished executing.

* CSCtr45978

Symptom: The Cisco IOS WAAS contains FTP or HTTP connections that are hung in the CONN\_ABORT state.

Conditions: If the Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Router is configured with Cisco IOS WAAS, the FTP packets or real HTTP user traffic to web sites is through the WAN link.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtr74577

Symptom: A traceback is seen at the coa\_ha\_proc\_qos\_template with lawful intercept using SNMP on L2TP sessions.

Conditions: This issue is seen in the Cisco ASR 1000 Aggregation Services Routers that have been configured for lawful intercept on L2TP sessions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtr96024

Symptom: A user is not notified about an error scenario relating to larger-than-allowed flow record of type performance-monitor being used in a performance monitor policy. This is misleading because the user may believe that the performance monitor policy is correctly attached to the desired interface, but will find that the task of monitoring traffic is not working as expected.

Conditions:

The symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The Performance Monitor feature is being used on the Cisco ASR platform.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A flow record of the performance-monitor type, which contains more than the maximum allowed fields, has been configured.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The user is referencing the performance-monitor type flow record in a performance monitor policy that has been attached to an interface. The maximum number of fields allowed in a flow record is 32 in the  **timestamp sys-uptime first** and  **field timestamp sys-uptime last** fields. If the timestamp fields are absent, they are automatically added to the record. However, the total number of fields should still be less than or equal to 32.

Workaround: Use a flow record of type performance-monitor having 32 or less fields.

* CSCts00341

Symptom: While executing a CLI that requires a domain name lookup such as ntp server server.domain.name, the command fails, and the following error message appears:

 `DNS is not resolved with dual RPs on ASR1k Translating server.domain.com...domain server (10.1.1.1). Standby doesn’t support this command. Invalid input detected at ‘^’ marker.`

Condition: This issue is observed when a redundant RP chassis is operating on the SSO mode.

Workaround: Instead of using hostname in the command, specify the IP address of the host. In some scenarios, this could cause the standby SUP to crash without a crash file. Remove the host names that require DNS lookup and use their IP addresses instead.

* CSCts02777

Symptom: Command attributes are sent multiple times in AAA command authorization and accounting requests.

Conditions: Seen in Release 15.0(1)S when TACACS command authorization or accounting or both are configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts44393

Symptom: A Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router crashes during a BGP stress test.

Conditions: This issue is more likely to occur when a large number of VRFs are repeatedly configured and deleted.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts46825

Symptom: The execution of the  **mtu** command within XConnect submode can, under certain preconditions, match and run in the interface mode due to a parser cache entry existing and being previously used from the XConnect submode's parent mode (service instance mode).

Conditions: The problem is generic to the parser cache, although we have no externally reported cases, and the preconditions are rare.The preconditions for triggering this issue include having identical commands in both a configuration submode and a grandchild submode of that submode as well, and then executing a sequence of commands that allow the system to create a cache entry for the submode instance of the command (this is normal), and subsequently (by repeating the subject command while in the child submode) learn that the child submode is a valid user of this same cache entry, and then finally attempt the identical command from the grandparent submode where the system thinks it can use the cache entry.

Workaround: Since the bug causes the command to execute in a mode other than the target mode, that command's change needs to be reversed, and then, after executing the  **clear parser cache** command, you can repeat the command from the desired submode. Another workaround is to add a few spaces to the end of the grandchild submode command before execution, to avoid the above cache entry due to mismatched input.

* CSCts52120

Symptom: Traceback found for PLATFORM\_INFRA-5-IOS\_INTR\_OVER\_LIMIT.

Conditions: RPSO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts54641

Symptom: Various small, medium, or big VB chunk leaks are seen when polling the EIGRP MIB and during an SSO.

Conditions: This issue is observed when MIBs are being polled or duing an SSO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts55778

Symptom: A problem involving two SAF forwarders occurs, with one running EIGRP rel8/Service-Routing rel1 and the other running EIGRP dev9/Service-Routing dev2. The capabilities manager, a client of the service-routing infrastructure, advertises two services. When forwarders are peering with the same release image, the services propagate between the forwarders without any problems. However, when you run rel8/rel1 on one forwarder and dev9/dev2 on the other forwarder, a third service appears in the topology table along with the SR database that was not advertised. The problem cannot be re-created if both the forwarders are running an Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4S or and Cisco IOS XE Release 3.5S image.

Conditions: This issue occurs when two SAF forwarders peer with each other using different release versions of the EIGRP SAF forwarder.

Workaround: Make sure that each EIGRP SAF forwarder is using the same image release.

* CSCts64346

Symptom: The  **bgp nexthop route-map** command does not work with many IPv6 and IPv4 next hops under IPv6 AFs.

Conditions: When the IPv6 Next Hop track is enabled by default, we need a way to filter some next hops for not being tracked. The  **bgp nexthop route-map** command does not work with many IPv6 and IPv4 next hops under IPv6 AFs.

Workaround: Disable IPv6 NHAT.

* CSCts68626

Symptom: PPPoE discovery packets cause packet drop.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you bring up a PPPoE session and then clear the session.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtt14747

* CSCtt19856

Symptom: On the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Routers, when making changes to the  **ppp multilink fragmentation size** command on the virtual template, the resulting change is reflected in the active bundles of the Cisco IOS software. However, the QFP does not reflect this change. The MLPPP fragment size remains at the previous setting, potentially impacting the performance and operation of the network.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the MLPPPoBB subscribers will have the  **ppp multilink fragmentation**  *size* command set on the virtual template and its size value is altered.

Workaround: MLPPPoBB subscribers using a virtual template that is changed should be flapped to pick up the new value.

 `% VRF table-id 0 not activeCompressed configuration from 6714 bytes to 2004 bytes[OK]`

 `Switch#`

 `Switch#`

Conditions: This issue is seen only if the configuration contains an **ip vrf** or an  **vrf definition** section.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtw98200

Symptom: Sessions do not come up while configuring RIP commands that affect the virtual template interface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if the Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are configured as LNS. RIP is configured with the timers basic 5 20 20 25 command. Also, every interface matching the network statements is automatically configured using the ip rip advertise 5 command. These interfaces include the loopback and virtual template interfaces too. On the Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, this configuration causes the creation of full VAIs that are not supported. Hence, the sessions do not come up. On the Cisco ASR 7200 Routers, VA subinterfaces can be created.

Workaround: Unconfigure the timers rip command.

* CSCtx02442

Symptom: An attempt to set uninitialized watched boolean and corresponding traceback are observed when the standby PRE crash in ISSU runversion stage.

Conditions:

**Note** 1. Single step ISSU;

2. Whenthe  **issu runversion** command issued the performedis PREA reloaded and changed to stby-PRE.

3. After the PREA is reloaded successfully, the PREA crashes with an exception.

4. After the PREA reloaded successfully, a traceback is reported on PREB (Active PRE).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx05726

Symptom: While creating a bulk number of traffic engineering tunnel interfaces on the router with the tunnel mpls traffic-eng exp-bundle master option, the standby route processor crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with a specific set of configurations that have a large number of tunnel interfaces (scale number 1000) followed by the creation of a large number of master tunnels (scale number 1000). Copying such a configuration to the router causes this crash to occur on the standby processor. The tunnel interfaces that are created at the beginning of the configuration are added as members to the master tunnels in the later part of the configuration. During this phase of creation of master tunnels and adding member tunnels, these tunnel interfaces go through a cycle of create-delete-create. When such a configuration is being synchronized to the standby route processor along with the resulting create-delete events, the standby processor crashes. This point at which the crash occurs is random and occur during the configuration of any of the master tunnels.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx06018

Symptom: The interface queue wedge is seen when performing the WAAS performance test.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when performing the WAAS performance test.

Workaround: Increase the interface input queue hold size.

* CSCtx06801

Symptom: Certain websites may not load or load very slowly when content scan is enabled. Delays of up to 30 seconds or more may be seen.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when content scan is enabled.

Workaround: Refreshing the helps sometimes, though not always.

* CSCtx06813

Symptom: The installation fails with the rwid type l2ckt error message. Also the VC may fail to come up on the Quad-Sup router. This bug is specific to the Cisco Catalyst 6000 Quad-Sup SSO.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in a scaled scenario, doing second switchover on Quad-Sup router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx14467

Symptom: The..... device crashes if kronis used to copy the configuration through the SCP and archive commands.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the server is down or the link to server is down.

Workaround: Manually upload the file to the server.

* CSCtx20517

Symptom: Customers see Cisco IOS-XE fragment errors in their logs repeatedly every 30 seconds after upgrading to the asr1000rp1-adventerprisek9.03.03.00.S.151-2.S.

Conditions: WCCP has to be enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx23593

Symptom: Some virtual circuit information is missing from the cAal5VccEntry SNMP MIB object in the output of the snmpwal command, but not in the router configuration command.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco 7204VXR NPE-G2 Router that is running the 12.2(33)SRE5 (c7200p-advipservicesk9-mz.122-33.SRE5.bin) image in the customer network. This issue may also occur in other releases. This issue typically occurs over a period of time because of creation or deletion of subinterfaces. It also occurs if a customer uses the snmp ifmib ifIndex Persist command, which retains the ifIndicies assigned to the @~@subinterfaces across router reload.

Workaround: The following are the workarounds:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enter the show atm vc privileged EXEC command on the same device to obtain a complete list of all the VCs or perform the SNMPWALK, suffixing the ifIndex of the interface to get the value.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enter the following configurations:

no snmp ifmib ifIndex Persist

no snmp ifindex persist

copy running start

reload

snmp ifmib ifIndex Persist

snmp ifindex persist

* CSCtx34823

Symptom: The OSPF keeps bringing up the dialer interface even after the expiry of idle timeout.

Conditions: This symptom occurs whenthe on-demand OSPF is configured under the dialer interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx38121

Symptom: IPv6 traffic does not pass through the interface attached to a service policy matching IPv6 the traffic using IPv6 ACL.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when attaching a service policy that matches the IPv6 traffic that is configured using ipv6 access-list on the EFP of an interface, which leads to a traffic drop.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx38338

Symptom: When a VFI is attached to a VLAN interface, it does not overwrite any of the existing VFIs.

Conditions: This occurs when a different VFI is attached to a VLAN interface.

Workaround: Avoid overwriting VFIs on a VLAN interface.

* CSCtx40818

Symptom: Traffic drops in a Cisco and the following error message is displayed:

 `%IP-3- LOOPPAK: Looping packet detected and dropped - src=122.0.0.11, dst=121.0.0.11, hl=20, tl=40, prot=6, sport=80, dport=57894`

Conditions: This symptom is observed if the WAAS, NAT, and firewall are enabled.

Workaround: Disable the WAAS.

* CSCtx40959

Symptom: The CPUHOG occurs.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the configuration comprising a mesh of 17 BGP routers, with all the routers having network statements covering the IP prefixes on the 16 VLAN subinterfaces that interconnect them. When the main interface on a given router is shut, all the subinterfaces also go down, causing all the connected routes to be removed. This leads to the CPUHOG.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx42223

Symptom: The connection with an FRR client that is registered for a BFD session is lost after an SSO. FRR cut-cover time is much more than 50 ms, which is not expected.

Conditions: This is observed after an SSO, when the FRR client is registered for a BFD session.

Workaround: Bring down the BFD session and configure it again.

* CSCtx48753

Symptom: Higher memory usage with PPP sessions than seen in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4 and Release 3.5.

Conditions: This issue is observed with configurations containing PPP sessions. Such configurations see up to 10 percent higher Cisco IOS memory usage than in previous images.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx49270

Symptom: A memory leak is observed when the Fast UDLD feature is configured on a router.

Conditions: The router must support UDLD, and the feature must also be enabled on the router using the  **udld aggressive** command. The UDLD can be enabled either on individual interfaces or globally.

Workaround: The workaround is to not enable the Fast UDLD feature on the router.

* CSCtx53391

Symptom: when the... router is reloaded or when some interface flap events are executed.

Conditions: When a VC bundle is configured under the same interface that has PVCS with IPv6 addresses, the Ucode crashes due to adjacency-related issues. Note that this issue is seen only intermittently.

Workaround: Avoid configuring PVCS with IPv6 addresses and bundles under the same main interface.

* CSCtx57146

Symptoms: SIP SPA goes out of service state in scaled sub=interface config (more than 2000 subinterface on single GigE port).

Conditions: While performing an ISSU between the iso1-rp2 and iso2-rp2 xe3.6 throttle images after ISSU run-version, the SIP SPA goes out of service and needs a heavily scaled configuration. This issue is observed when there are 2000 to 3000 subinterfaces on a single SPA and the following limits are exceeded: overall dual stack VRFs per box; 2800 dual stack limit on interface: 1000.

Workaround: The issue is not seen in the following scenario:

1. Before performing a load version from RP0 (initial active), execute the  **show ipv6 route table | inc IPv6**  command.

2. Note down the number of IPv6 route tables in the system.

3. Perform a load version.

4. Wait for the standby to come up to Standby hot.

5. Enable the standby console from RP0 (active)  **asr1000#configure terminal**. Enter the configuration commands, one per line. End with  **CNTL/Z**. a **sr1000(config)#**,  **asr1000(config)#redundancy**, **asr1000(config-red)#main-cpu**, and  **asr1000(config-r-mc)#standby console enable**.

6. Log in to the standby console and execute the  **asr1000-stby# show ipv6 route table | inc IPv6** command.

7. Note down the number of IPv6 route tables in the standby... If it is less than the number noted in Step 2, wait for a few minutes and reverify until it reaches the number noted in Step 2.

8. Issue ISSU run version from RP0 (active).

* CSCtx67028

Symptom: Tracebacks are seen during a traffic condition when DMVPN and WAAS Express are configured.

Conditions: This symptom is observed while initiating an FTP session from the GW, where GW DMVPN and WAAS Express are configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx68155

Symptom: Event is triggered as soon as configured and the  **show event manager policy registered event-type timer-absolute** commad shows the wrong time value.

Conditions: Epoch-to-UNIX time conversion overflows after GMT: Thu, 07 Feb 2036 06:28:14. Also the timer\_spec value passed to the timer is incorrect.

Workaround: Input of epoch value is limited to 2085978494(GMT: Thu, 07 Feb 2036 06:28:14) value assigned to timer\_spec value is corrected.

* CSCtx74051

Symptom: While performing an ISSU downgrade, IPv6 flexible netflow monitors may be displayed. Also, the running configuration is shown with incorrect subtraffic types.

Conditions: This issue occurs during a downgrade to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)S (Cisco IOS XE Release 3.5). The monitors that are affected are those applied to IPv6.

Workaround: The Netflow code should capture packets, as expected, on Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)S. However, a reboot of the device should be performed before saving the running configuration because the affected configuration that is saved will be incorrect and will therefore fail to work at startup.

* CSCtx75190

Symptom: In a multihomed setup, set up the traffic as explained in the DDTS. When the end-to-end traffic starts to flow smoothly, perform an RP switchover on ED1. Traffic from Ixia 3 to Ixia 1 and Ixia 3 to Ixia 2 on odd VLANs (ED1 is the AED for odd VLANs) is dropped with UnconfiguredMplsFia counters incrementing.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you perform an RP switchover with a scaled OTV configuration in a multihomed setup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx80535

Symptom: The DHCP pool that is configured for ODAP assigns the same IP address to multiple sessions.

Conditions: PPP users receive pool via Radius server. The pool is defined on the Cisco 10000 Series Routers to use the ODAP. The ODAP receives the subnets from the Radius server correctly, and assigns IPs to PPP sessions. However, sometimes, two users end up having the same IP address.

Workaround: Clear the two sessions sharing the same IP address.

* CSCtx81562

Symptom: LBM gets dropped when validated the replied data activated on ASR1000

Conditions: This is seen when LBM is initiated with the validation flag.

Workaround: The issue has been fixed in CSCtx81562. However, even without the fix, the CFM loopback can work without turning on the validation option as the workaround.

* CSCtx81748

Symptoms: The occurance of a small amount of packet drops due to antireplay failure may be seen when IPSec is configured.

Conditions: The packet drops may be seen either when the IPsec session brought-up or when the lifetime of IPSec SA expires and a new SA is established

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx82538

Symptom: This DDTS has been raised to remove platform-specific macros.

Conditions: Platform specific macros are observed with CPU-specific checks. CPU-specific checks should not be in PI code. Use of shims is required.

Workaround: Remove CPU-specific checks.

* CSCtx86160

Symptom: The following message appears when the  **show interfaces** command is used when a SPA is being installed:  `Hardware is N/A.`

Conditions: This is seen on Cisco ASR1006 routers with12.2(33)XNF2c.

In some scenarios of SPA hardware insert or removal combined with RP switchover, the hardware type string of interface stays at N/A. In some scenarios this is observed on both the standby RP and the active RP.

Workaround: If only the active RP shows this message, single switchover is enough to recover. If both the active RP and the standby RP show this message, a double switchover must be performed.

* CSCtx88467

Symptom: Configuring CEM PW on T1 controller and unconfiguring them once they are up. Memory leak is observed.

Conditions: If a CEM PW is up, only incremental memory leak will be observed @ dsensor\_subblock\_get\_or\_create.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx90571

Symptom: The following Traceback message is logged when you unconfgure a packet tracing:

 `%CPPOSLIB-3-ERROR_NOTIFY: F0: cpp_cp: cpp_cp encountered an error.`

Conditions: Configure and unconfigure packet tracing.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx92598

Symptom: The router crashes due to a low-memory condition caused by memory fragmentation. The following error message appears:

 `Feb 10 05:59:21.874: %SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL: Memory allocation of 2372 bytes failed from 0x5E77FC9, alignment 8 Pool: Processor Free: 33888144 Cause: Memory fragmentation`

Conditions: The router (seen on ASR 1000 RP2) that crashes will be an ingress PE for MVPN V6 with highly scaled configuration. PIM signaling, PIM SSM and data MDTS must be used in the core. Example scaling numbers are 600 mvrfs and 16 data mdts, 100 routers per mvrf;

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) This issue will not occur if c-router signaling is used instead of PIM. The crash may occur in about 12 hours of running with the above configurations in a Cisco ASR1000 RP2 with typical memory size of 2 GB or 4 GB.

---

Workaround: Perform one of these tasks:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Use smaller scaling numbers (much less than 600 movers, or 100 routes per mfr. or 16 data mdse. per mfr. in core)

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Use c-route signaling in the core. A large amount of PIM control frames in the core can be avoided by using c-route signaling instead of PIM signaling.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do not use data MDT; rely only on default. This also reduces the amount of PIM control frames that arrive at the ingress PE having a larger memory (say 4GB) will not help avoid the issue; the crash may happen after a longer duration.

* CSCtx94353

Symptom: The following error message is displayed:

 `%TUN-3-TUN_HA: Tunnel HA: Tunnel creation on standby: mismatching %COMMON_FIB-3-FIBHWIDBINCONS: An internal software error occurred. Tunnel0 linked to wrong hwidb Tunnel0`

Conditions: Create auto-tunnel number range with overlap with dynamic tunnels by other features such as multicast-routing.

Workaround: Avoid usingan overlapping auto-tunnel number range with the other features.

* CSCtx97131

Symptom: To send a VSA in an authentication and accounting request, the following commands have to be enabled:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)  **Router(config)#radius-server vsa send authentication**

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)  **Router(config)#radius-server vsa send accounting**

With the DDTS, these commands are enabled by default. The VSA will then send the corresponding authentication and accounting request.

Conditions:  `Router#sh run ? aaa Show AAA configurations l l Configuration with defaults ---- Router#sh run all | i radius-server........ radius-server vsa send accounting radius-server vsa send authentication`.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx97298

Symptom: The unsupported command  **show ip accounting** is still available.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: Explicitly include or exclude command chains.

* CSCty01237

Symptom: The following error message appears:

 `%OER_BR-5-NOTICE: Prefix Learning STARTED CMD: 'show run' <timestamp>`

Conditions: This issue is seen under the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you configure PfR with a learn list, using a prefix list as a filter and enable learn.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you use a configuration tool, script, or NMS that periodically executes the  **show run**  *<noCmdBold>* on the MC over HTTP or through some other means.

Workaround: The following are the workarounds:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you use the PFR Learn List feature, do not execute the  **show run** command periodically.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you use a monitoring tool that executes the  **show run** command periodically, avoid using a learn list configuration in PfR.

* CSCty03745

Symptom: The BGP sends an update using an incorrect next hop for the L2VPN VPLS address family, when the IPv4 default route is used or an IPv4 route to a certain destination exists - specifically, a route to 0.x.x.x. For this condition to a occur, the next hop of that default route or a certain IGP or static route is used to send a BGP update for the L2VPN VPLS address family.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the IPv4 default route exists, for example,  **ip route**  *0.0.253.0 255.255.255.0*  *<next-hop>*.

Workaround: The following are the workarounds:

Workaround: Do not set  **entPhysicalAlias** for these MIB entries.

* CSCty37233

Symptom: A Layer 3 (routed) interface can be converted to a Layer 2 (switched) interface by applying the switchport configuration command. If the interface was configured as a VNET trunk, the VNET subinterfaces are deleted. Subsequently, if the switchport command is removed, the VNET trunk configuration will reappear, but the VNET trunk will no longer be functional. When a switchover is performed following the sequence above, the new active takes over as expected, but when the old active reboots as the standby, configuration synchronization fails because the standby attempts to create the VNET subinterfaces that no longer exist on the active. This results in an ifindex-sync failure and a PRC error that causes the RP to go into a continuous reboot loop.

Conditions: The reboot problem will occur only on switch platforms with a redundant RP.

Workaround: Remove the VNET trunk configuration from an interface before converting it from Layer 3 to Layer 2.

* CSCty37836

Conditions: The issue occurs after the switchover, when CoA service logon is executed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty85918

Symptom: WRED on PPPoE session does not match on DSCP/PREC with MPLS traffic.

Conditions: PPPoE get terminated on a Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Services Router acting as LNS. The L2TP circuit is actually MPLS switched out of the router. The policy map correctly matches packets into the corresponding class, but WRED always has the packets matching the WRED default class. The packets should match a DSCP or PREC value because the policy map is on the session and not on the egress physical interface.

Workaround: If MPLS is removed from the egress L2TP tunnel interface, the packets are classified correctly by WRED.

* CSCty85926

Symptom: VC (VPLS/EoMPLS) will stay down with the following message when the  **show mpls l2 vc detail** command is used:

 `Signaling protocol: LDP, peer unknown`

* CSCty89777

Symptom: The committed Memory value of 96 percent exceeds the critical level of 95 percent messages on the router console with a 4G CCN image.

Conditions: On a 16G router, IOSD gets 11G, leaving 5G to virtual instance and other Linux processes. 16G is enough for real physical memory usage but smand is pretty conservative and it counts virtual memory or allocated memory, which is different from the actually committed physical memory. 3PA is added, that is, QEMU/CCN and 4G memory is preallocated and passed into the guest regardless of whether the guest actually uses all of that memory. In such a situation, in this situation where the virtual memory is large, but the real memory that is in use could actually be way smaller.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty91465

Symptom: The VRF interface does not work even if the policy maps are configured correctly to receive the packets from the VRF interface.

* CSCtz55969

Symptom: Changes to a custom profile are reflected in the actual packet transmission rates.

Conditions: Video with a custom profile

Workaround: Remove the corresponding profile, and create a new one with the required changes.

* CSCtz56671

Symptom: An ACL is applied for filtering within a classmap for shaping traffic. When you try to resequence the ACL, the class map DB is not populated with new sequencing, and that causes a crash.

Conditions: ACL resequence that should be used within class-map

Workaround: Do not use resequencing, or remove and re-add the same after resequencing.

Further Problem Description:  **ip access-list resequence <ACL #/name>** followed by either a no  **<ACE #>** or a  **no <ACL #/name>**. The crash occurs inside the MDB and the root cause of this crash is that the sequence numbers stored in the MDB are out of sync with the sequence numbers stored in ACL. Therefore, when the  **no ACE #** command is issued, the MDB tries to delete that ACE from its tree, but never finds it and gets stuck in a loop.

* CSCtz58037

Symptom: The router crashes after  **Shut**  **no shut** and OIR commands.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the router is configured with the  **cfm one up mep** command and the  **cfm down mep** command with trunk EFP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz58941

Symptom: The router crashes when users execute the show ip route XXXX<noCmdBold> command.

Conditions: This symptom is seen during the display of the  **show ip route XXXX** output, when the next hops of networks are removed.

Workaround: Use the  **show ip route**  command without x.x.x.x.

* CSCtz59615

Symptom: The IPv6 route does not get installed in the IPv6 VRF routing table.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in a RADIUS Framed-IPv6-Route.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz61599

Symptom: After adding the performance-monitor policy map under the port channel interface, it continuously displays the information that Port-channel1 has more than one active member link:  `it-wan-agg5-14(config)#int port-channel 1 it-wan-agg5-14(config-if)#$performance-monitor input PERF-MON-port-channel it-wan-agg5-14(config-if)#$performance-monitor output PERF-MON-port-channel it-wan-agg5-14(config-if)# Port-channel1 has more than one active member link Port-channel1 has more than one active member link`

Conditions: This symptom is observed after the performance-monitor policy map is added under the port channel interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz63421

Symptom: Dynamic update of the encapsulation tag to Single Vlan on Trunk EFP Configured interface must not be allowed.

Conditions: 1. Configure range of VLANS in Encap tag on trunk efp interface. 2. Change Encapsulation dynamically from range of Vlans to single Vlan encap tag. 3. Check running Configs of Trunk interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz63699

Symptom: In some scenarios, the VRRP "owned" address state is not correctly represented within the "default" VRRS pathway. Additionally, there are various scenarios in which "owned" address conflict checking is not correctly carried out.

Conditions: These symptoms are only exhibited when a user is using an "owned" address within the VRRP group. An "owned" address is a VRRP virtual address that is equal to one of the addresses configured on the interface.

Workaround: Use a unique VRRP group address that does not conflict with any of the interface addresses or another address within the same VRF.

* CSCtz63968

Symptom: The dialer pool is removed from the Ethernet interface.

Conditions: Crashes occur after the timer expires for PADI. It seems the session was not cleared properly.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz64836

Symptom: The  **debug redundancy idb-sync-history** command does not work.

Conditions: The " **debug redundancy idb-sync-history** " command does not work.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz65370

Symptom: When performing an RP switchover with a large number of DMVPN sessions (> 3K), ESP40 may reload.

Conditions: The issue occurs during an RP switchover with many DMVPN sessions.

Workaround: Clear the IPSec sessions before performing an RP switchover.

* CSCtz67151

Symptom: The IP SLA responder process causes high CPU utilization.

Conditions: Configuring a permanent address in the IP SLA responder before enabling the responder can cause High CPU utilisation. To recreate, perform the following configs: i `n responder ip sla responder no ip sla responder ip sla responder udp-echo ipaddress A.B.C.D port XXXX To recover from high cpu, ip sla responder no ip sla responder udp-echo ipaddress A.B.C.D port XXXX`

Workaround: Ensurethat you enable the responder before programming the permanent addresses, or do not use the permanent addresses.

* CSCtz67726

Symptom: Single probe ID is not permitted on the  **ip sla group schedule** command. Entering the same as probe ID under the  **ip sla group schedule** command in the format of the ID is acceptable but this will be displayed as a single probe ID on the running configuration.

Conditions: This issue is seen while using a single probe ID under the  **ip sla group schedule** command.

Workaround: Use the  **ip sla schedule** command for the single probe ID.

* CSCtz67785

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Routers may experience a CPP crash.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is configured for the Session Border Controller (SBC). During periods of high traffic, FP reports a lot of media up events to the RP, which can cause the RP to crash.

Workaround: If the  **ip nbar protocol-discovery** command is enabled, it may exacerbate the crashes. Removing it may help provide some stability.

* CSCtz69913

Symptom: NHRP packets received from a DMVPN tunnel using tunnel protection are dropped on a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Routers when the VRF-Aware Service Infrastructure (VASI) interface is configured and the IPSec traffic is traversing the VASI interface. This only happens when using VASI in combination with tunnel protection on the tunnel interface. The NHRP packets are decrypted correctly, but are dropped at the tunnel interface, and the drop counter shows the following drop reason:

 `show platform hardware qfp active statistics drop | e _0_.*_0_ ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Global Drop Stats Packets Octets ------------------------------------------------------------------------- UnconfiguredIpv4Fia 6734`

Conditions: The issue occurs when the VASI interface configuration is used for Tunnel protection.

Workaround: 1) Use a dynamic crypto map on the physical interface. However note that this may cause issues with the spoke behind NAT. 2) Disable VASI, if possible.

* CSCtz69986

Symptom: The ESP free memory of the ASR 1000 Series Aggregate Services Routers slowly decreases over time (~ 7MB per day).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the WCCP is configured on the interfaces.

Workaround: There is no workaround, unless the WCCP interface configuration is removed.

* CSCtz70973

Symptom: The Cisco ASR1002-X Router or ESP100 may reload unexpectedly.

Conditions: The issue is typically observed when a large number of interfaces are present.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz71084

Symptom: When the prefix from the CE is lost, the related route that is advertised as best-external to RR by the PE does not get withdrawn. Even though the BGP table gets updated correctly at the PE, the RIB continues to have a stale route.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in a topology where CE0 and CE1 advertise the same prefixes:

 `CE0------------------PE0---------------------RR | | | | CE1------------------PE1----------------------|`

Workaround: Hard clear.

* CSCtz71087

Symptom: Multiple outside global addresses are assigned the same outside local address.

Conditions: This issue occurs in a outside dynamic mapping configuration, when running ALG traffic hitting the dynamic mapping, multiple outside global addresses are assigned the same outside local address.

Workaround: Clear the ip nat translation \* command.

* CSCtz71208

Symptom: On a Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Services Router, once the error  `CPP_FM-3-CPP_FM_TCAM_ERROR` is seen, the only way to recover TCAM is to reload the router. Removing the configuration leading to TCAM exhaustion is not enough.

Conditions: This is seen after the TCAM is exhausted. This bug pertains only to recovery from exhaustion, not the exhaustion itself. For information about the latter, that, please see CSCtz33305. Deny Statements could exhaust the TCAM entries.

Workaround: Reload the router.

* CSCtz73450

Symptom: Multiple <CR> options for the snmp-server enable traps mac-notification change move threshold" command results in the following error message:

 `Ambiguous command.`

Conditions: When trying to configure the snmp-server enable traps mac-notification change move threshold command, the parser fails to process the command properly and results in an  `Ambiguous command` message.

Workaround: The user may turn on the snmp-server enable traps mac-notification change move threshold command along with other traps by configuring  `snmp-server enable traps` and then removing the other unwanted commands. But the user will be unable to remove the commands from the configuration for the same reason that prevents it from being configured.

* CSCtz74060

Symptom: The  **show platform hardware qfp active feature ess state** command does not display output.

Conditions: The output is displayed in XML format during ISSU sub-package downgrade from XE3.7.0 to lower releases on 4RU. The output is displayed normally after the upgrade. This condition does not have an impact on the functionality.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz74310

* CSCtz75230

Symptom: When the remote VLAN interface is unshut, with IPv4 data traffic being sent continuously to the remote VLAN interface, the corresponding ARP entry is not created.

Conditions: When using static FRR configuration and disabling the backup route, shut down the remote vlan interface of the primary path, and then wait for the ARP entry to be removed from ASR1000 Series Aggregation Router after the ARP timeout.

Workaround:

Method 1: Configure the static ARP entry.

Method 2: Provide a valid backup route. Method 3: Do not use static FRR.

* CSCtz75371

Symptom: When the router is configured with script, the BFD sessions remain inactive. If the same configuration is run manually, the BFD sessions come into the UP state.

Conditions: This issue occurs only when the bug is reproduced with the script.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Descriptions:

1. The inactive sessions come into the active state when the test client is registered or deregistered with BFD manually.

2. This issue appears to be a timing-related issue.

3. Further investigation depends on the availability of the test bed.

* CSCtz75380

Symptom: A Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router sends malformed RADIUS packets during retransmission or failover to a secondary RADIUS server, for example, Cisco CAR.

Conditions: This issue occurs during retransmission of RADIUS access requests or if RADIUS packets are sent to a secondary RADIUS server.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz75433

Symptom: NBAR Field Extraction (AKA collect through IPFIX) does not work for flows over IPv6 tunnels.

Conditions: This is relevant when configuring NBAR to classify inside the tunneled IPv6 flows. This is anyway not fully supported in the AVC eco-system in XE3.7.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz77171

Symptom: Subscriber drops are not reported in Mod4 Accounting.

Conditions: This symptom is seen on the checking policy map interface for account QoS statistics on a port channel subinterface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz80643

Symptom: A PPPoE client's host address is installed in the LNS' VRF routing table with the  **ip vrf receive**  *vrf name* command supplied either via RADIUS or in a virtual-template, but is not installed by CEF as attached. It is instead installed by CEF as receive, which is incorrect.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only when the virtual-access interface is configured with the ip  **vrf receive**   *vrf name* command through the virtual-template or RADIUS profile.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz82591

Symptom: IPv6 multicast internal tunnel numbers conflict with user-configured tunnel numbers.

Conditions: When user-configured tunnel numbers are in a low range, and the number of internal tunnels being created by IPv6 multicast overlaps with user-configured tunnel numbers on reload, the  **nvgen** commands fail.

Workaround: User-configured tunnel numbers should start at a high value range to avoid conflicting with internal tunnels.

* *CSCtz82711*

Symptom: Datapath session crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when SGSN sends echo req before PDP\_CREATE\_REQ.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz83062

Symptom: Removing and attaching bandwidth percent configurations under a policy-map results in an error message.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you peform the following procedure:

1. Create a policy that has bandwidth percent for both user-defined classes and a class default that adds up to 100 percent.

2. Attach to the interface.

3. Remove one of the user-defined classes and attempt to reattach the same class with the same bandwidth percent value again.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz83221

Symptom: Either the active RP or the standby RP route processor crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is seen during the configuration or removal of ATM virtual circuits.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz85102

Symptom: Packets with the L2 multicast address and L3 unicast address combination cannot be forwarded by the L2TPv3 tunnel on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Router.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with packets having the L2 multicast address and L3 unicast address combination. This issue is seen in all Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz86747

Symptoms: The xxx router crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when all the user-defined class maps with live traffic are being removed.

Workaround: Close the interface first before removing the class map.

* CSCtz87676

Symptom: The ARP request to the same ip address in different VRFs is incorrectly rate limited. For example:  `ping vrf 2001 172.16.0.2 repeat 100 timeout 0 ping vrf 2002 172.16.0.2 repeat 100 timeout 0 ping vrf 2003 172.16.0.2 repeat 100 timeout 0 ping vrf 2004 172.16.0.2 repeat 100 timeout 0.` From the debug arp output, you can see ASR1000 generates only 1 arp request in 2 seconds (0.5 pps)  `*Apr 29 03:10:44.932: IP ARP: sent req src 172.16.0.1 *Apr 29 03:10:46.901: IP ARP: sent req src 172.16.0.1 *Apr 29 03:10:48.879: IP ARP: sent req src 172.16.0.1 *Apr 29 03:10:51.004: IP ARP: sent req src 172.16.0.1 *Apr 29 03:10:53.078: IP ARP: sent req src 172.16.0.1 *Apr 29 03:10:55.105: IP ARP: sent req src 172.16.0.1` <snip> Per the design, the arp request to the same ip address in the same VRF is 0.5pps. But when the ip address appears in different VRFs, the ARP request rate should be 0.5 PPS in each VRF.

Conditions: Day 1 issue.

Workaround: static arp.

* CSCtz89337

Symptom: Two paths with the same nexthop are marked and advertised when the all option is set. All paths advertised should have a unique NH.

Conditions: The issue occurs when there are two paths with the same nexthop.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz89485

Symptom: NAT traffic passes through the new standby router following HSRP switchover.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in HA NAT (NAT with HSRP) mappings with inside global addresses that overlap a subnet owned by a router interface.

Workaround:

1. Force a HSRP switchover so that the initial standby router takes activity.

2. Remove and readd HSRP NAT mappings on the newly active router.

3. Force an HSRP switchover back to the initial active router.

* CSCtz89608

Symptom: A router that is operating in an ISG environment experiences a crash due to memory corruption.

Conditions: This symptom occurs within the SSS context.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz89697

Symptom: The SIP-400 crashed.

Conditions: This issue occurs because of accessing the NULL pointer in a timer wheel. However, the trigger that contributes to the NULL pointer has not yet been determined. I have added the Eng-notes which has the code analysis for this crash.

Workaround: You can prevent the crash by adding the NULL check condition before calling tw\_timer\_stop API.

* CSCtz90000

Symptom: "service-policy type performance-monitor inline input" is applied to a range of interfaces.

Conditions: Range interface mode may reload a switch if perf-mon inline is applied.

Workaround: Do not use teh range command option. Apply inline command one at one interface at a time.

* CSCtz90909

Symptoms: A router crashes when the  **no l2 vfi**  *vfi-name*  **point-to-point** command is run.

Conditions: This symptom occurs while unconfiguring l2 vfi.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz92606

Symptom: The MFR memberlinks-T1 serial interfaces created under a CHOC12 controller do not get decoupled from MFR even after the MFR bundle interface is deleted. After the MFR bundle interface is reconfigured, the memberlinks do not appear under it.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in MFR with memberlinks as T1 serials from CHOC12 sonet controller.

Workaround: Unconfigure and reconfigure the encapsulation frame-relay MFRx under each memberlink after reconfiguring the MFR bundle interface.

* CSCtz93922

Symptom: An XConnect virtual circuit may be down on one peer while it is up on the remote peer. The output of the  **show mpls l2 transport vc detailed** command indicates that it is in the LruRrd state and that the last status it received from the remote peer is pw-tx-fault.

Conditions: This symptom has been observed when both the attachment circuit and core-facing interfaces are on the same module and that module is reset using the  **hw-module module**  *module*  **reset** command, and the remote peer is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(02)S or later.

Workaround: Run the  **shutdown** command followed bythe  **no**  **shutdown** command on the attachment circuit.

* CSCtz94902

Symptom: Memory allocation failure occurs when attaching to SIP-40 using a web browser.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on the line card.

Workaround: Reset the line card.

* CSCtz95698

Symptom: The standby router by the BGP design remains in the read/write mode after it gets out of the read only mode both in the Active RP and the Standby RP. The read/write mode might, in some timing situation, become the startup state of the new Active RP after SSO. Whereas a fresh reload starts with the read only mode. This read/write startup state is not a desirable state by BGP code design. Hence, this DDTS introduces a new read/scan state for the Standby RP. With this fix the Standby RP stays in the read/scan state and does not change to the read/write state.

Conditions: This is a timing situation when the BGP standby RP after switchover might start best-path or update activity with stale RW mode, then get into RO before finally getting back to the operational RW mode again. This may at times cause unnecessary path updates to go out immediately after switchover (in the stale RW mode, carried forward from its Standby state) only to be replaced with the fully operational best-path updates, once the new Active RP gets to the fully operational RW mode.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz95995

Symptom: If the router receives the same prefix or masks with the same AD, the code of route origin in the  **show ip route** command is overwritten.

Conditions: This issue occurs at L2TP situation, and can be shown on 12.4(25f) or 15.1(4)M4.

Workaround: Use the  **clear ip route**  command.

* CSCtz96167

Symptom: The QoS DSCP cases fail.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in a QoS profile (with 31 as the DSCP value configured under the SBE) but DSCP bit is still sent as 0.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz96504

Symptom: Some of the backup VCs go down after SSO.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only on a scale scenario, for example, by creating 500 primary VCs and 500 backup VCs.

Workaround: The backup VCs can be brought to the SB state by issuing the  **clear xconnect peerid**  *peerid of the PW*  **vcid**  *vcid* command, although it is not usually recommended.

* CSCtz97093

Symptom: The multilink input counters are not increasing.

Conditions: The issue occurs when.... it is used as the IPv6 DmVPN tunnel source.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz97244

Symptom: IPSLA video operation with VRF support does not receive any packets.

Conditions: This symptom occurs whenthe  **no emulate** command is specified with the input interface.

Workaround: Use the  **emulate** command to specify the input interface that has access to the VRF.

* CSCtz98255

Symptom: The BGP incorrectly accepts the  **route-reflector-client** configuration under neighbor CLI if the neighbor is configured to be eBGP. There is no functionality loss, but the command should not be accepted.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: Remove the incorrect configuration.

* CSCtz98347

Symptom: When ISI-S is configured to run Level 2, the IS-IS LFA does not create repair path if the total metric to a prefix is 1024.

Conditions: This issue was found with 15.2(2)S, and when the ISIS metric is more than 1024 and configured to run Level 2.

Workaround: Ensure that the total metric to a prefix is less than 1024, or use a narrow metric setting.

* CSCtz99914

Symptom: Traffic drops on MLP interfaces with QoS after a system reload.

Conditions: Reload.

Workaround: Use the  **Shut** and  **no shut** commands in the multilink bundle after reload if the tail drops on the interface are displayed.

* CSCua01375

Symptom: Certificate validation fails when CRL is not retrieved.

Conditions: This impacts ASR when configured to use a VRF.

Workaround: Use a certificate map to revoke certificates or publish CRL to an HTTP server and configure CDP override to fetch the CRL.

* CSCub01576

Symptom: The ESP reloads on the Cisco ASR 1000 router due to ucode crash.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Routers where the Layer 4 Redirect feature is configured. This problem was firs seen in Cisco Release 15.2(01)S. This issue may not be seen at all in some customer environments, but may be seen about once a week in medium-sized high CPS ISG production networks.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua01641

Symptom: The NAS-IP address in the RADIUS accounting-on packet is 0.0.0.0:

 `RADIUS: Acct-Session-Id [44] 10 00000001 RADIUS: Acct-Status-Type [40] 6 Accounting-On [7] RADIUS: NAS-IP-Address [4] 6 0.0.0.0 RADIUS: Acct-Delay-Time [41] 6 0`

Conditions: This occurs when you restart the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua02783

Symptom: Get/Walk on PROCESS-MIB fails.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you upgrade the device from 3.5 to 3.6.

Workaround: Reload the device.

* CSCua03201

Symptom: If the VPN ID of an existing Virtual Forwarding Interface (VFI) is changed on a dual RP system, and then a stateful switchover (SSO) is performed, the new standby router may repeatedly reload.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S and Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.0S and later.

Workaround: In order to configure a new VPN ID for a VFI, completely remove the existing VFI and reconfigure it.

* CSCua03452

Symptom: The CLI displays the wrong queue\_depth and qlimit values.

Conditions: The issue occurs when you issue the show platform hardware qfp active interface bqs queue output default interface GigabitEthernet0/1/0 linkdown command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua03521

Symptom: Router reloaded.

Conditions: This issue occurs in some situations where IPV6 address compression fails, and Cisco IOS attempts to restore the previous ACL, but fails.

Workaround: Rearrange the ACLs.

* CSCua04049

Symptom: If a capture is stopped because of the limits reached, and the capture is started immediately, the capture fails to stop.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after the immediate reactivation of a capture.

Workaround: Clear the buffer before reactivating the capture or wait for a minimum of 5 seconds before reactivating a capture point.

* CSCua04277

Symptom: IPv6 multicast routes do not get installed correctly.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you perform the following procedure:
 1. Enable IPv6 multicast.
 2. Configure the IPv6 addresses on the interface.
 3. Configure RIP on these interfaces. Sometimes, the IPv6 route learned from RIP could be missing in the IPv6 multicast routing table.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua04991

Symptom: The parser chain for the  **show application ip route**  command is broken for topology.

Conditions: This issue is visible when topology is enabled in the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua06023

Symptom: Some of WBX image builds are failing.

Conditions: The issue does not occur in a specific condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua06026

Symptom: The EIGRP routes are not getting redistributed in OSPF.

Conditions: Stops working intermittently.

Workaround: Redistribute the connected networks in OSPF.

* CSCua06598

Symptom: Router may crash with breakpoint exception.

Conditions: This symptom is observed whenthe SNMP polls the IPv6 MIB inetCidrRouteEntry and a locally sourced BGP route is installed in IPv6 RIB.

Workaround: Disable SNMP IPv6 polling.

* CSCua06804

Symptom: IPv6 trace route shows incorrect 2nd hop IP address.

Conditions: Over the interAS network.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua06874

Symptom: Certain connected routes within a VRF are not installed into the EIGRP topology table (and advertised) although they are in the VRF routing table and are shown as connected.

Conditions: This issue is seen when you use the ip vrf receive < *vrf-name* > command under the connected interface that is to be advertised by the EIGRP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua07184

Symptom: On a Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Router with stateful NAT configuration and using inter-chassis redundancy, removing VRF causes the mapping ID to be locked when trying to apply the NAT rules again: %Snat mapping ID 1 in use %Snat mapping ID 2 in use. The NAT rules that were automatically deleted and that customer want to re-apply : ip nat inside source list <ACL name> pool <pool name> redundancy 1 mapping-id 1 vrf <vrf name> overload.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the following tasks are performed:
 - Remove the VRF using the  **no ip**  **vrf**   *vrf name*  command. All the NAT configurations related to this VRF are deleted.
 - Restore the VRF configuration, and add IP VRF definition.
 - When you try to add the NAT VRF-related configuration, the mapping ID gets locked.

Workaround: Unconfigure the  **ip nat inside source** command before deleting the IP VRF, as described here:
 1. Remove the NAT configurations from the Inside and Outside interfaces.
 2. lear ip nat trans.
 3. Remove NAT rules (no ip nat inside source xxxx xxxx xxx)
 4. Remove and readd the VRF configuration.
 5. Readd the NAT rules and the NAT configurations on the interfaces.

* CSCua07228

Symptom: Locally generated traffic is not encrypted when a crypto map is applied to the LISP interface.

Conditions: The issue occurs when GET VPN or the static crypto map is configured on the LISP interface to encrypt traffic between the LISP EIDs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua07367

Symptom: When retrieving session information from the VPDN management MIB, some sessions are missing. In addition, the SNMP walk fails to get terminated, instead returning the same sessions repeatedly.

Conditions: This issue is found in Cisco IOS versions 15.2(01)S01 and later, 15.2(02)T1 and later, 15.1(04)M4 and later, and 15.0(01)M and later.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua07502

Symptom: The throughput on a multiple member-link MLPPP bundles with links of differing bandwidth may be slightly less than expected due to a complication inthe load balancing algorithm due to mixed bandwidth links. Note that throughput degradation is minimal. The issue was first seen in 15.2(02)S01, but was addressed in Release 15.2(02)S02. Therefore, Release 15.2(02)S01 is the only release with this symptom.

Conditions: The issue occurs if the MLPPP bundle has multiple member-link MLPPP bundles with links of differing bandwidth.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua08206

Symptom: VCs (configured with VPLS) on the standby RP in down state.

Conditions: core link flap.

Workaround: clear xcon all

* CSCua08027

Symptom: Tracebacks appear on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers when LI is used with SNMP-based TAP. This occurs from Cisco IOS XE35 Release

Conditions: This issue occurs when SNMP-based LI is used and the routers are running versions XE35 or later.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua09443

Symptom: The MLPPPoLNS (L2TP) packet transmit action does not handle the packet transmit operation correctly when the MLPPPoLNS packet is being sent via MPLS VRF (that is, the L2TP tunnel is in a VRF). In the Cisco ASR1000 Series Routers 15.1(3)S and 15.2(1)S release trains, the packet is transmitted as expected, but the MLP Tx ESS Packet Drop statistics may be seen incrementing and the MLP Tx Unfragmented Packet statistics for the bundle indicate that no packets have been transmitted (even though they are likely to have been transmitted). Problem would in most cases be transparent in this release train but MLPPP statistics would be incorrect. In the Cisco ASR 1000 Routers 15.2(2)S release trains, if multilink fragmentation, interleave, or both are DISABLED, the behavior will be the same as in the release trains described earlier. If multilink fragmentation, interleave, or both are ENABLED, the first MLPPP fragment will be sent, but not the remaining fragments. The peer router is also likely to detect lost MLPPP fragments.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the MLPPPoLNS packet is sent via MPLS VRF (that is, L2TP tunnel is in a VRF).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua09653

Symptom: Snmp-server host x.x.x.x public bgp.

Conditions: Functionality is not broken but CLI is not NVGened. However, when router is reloaded functionality would not work.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua10815

Symptom: A leak is seen in CPP memory, and the FP crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the IPSec WCCP is configured. Due to a large number of debug log messages in the cpp\_cp\_F0-0.log file, there is a memory leak in the CPP, and the FP crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua11924

Symptom: Under certain conditions, a Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Router may send ICMP type 3 code 4 (unreachable, fragmentation needed, but with the DF bit set) packets with a wrong source IP address, that is, the IP address configured on the ingress interface of the original packet (which is too big and cannot be fragmented) instead of an IP address belonging to an interface in the VRF the packet is destined for.

Conditions: This issue occurs when MPLS VPN is used and the big packet enters the router through an MPLS interface, and when the egress interface has a lower MTU and belongs to a (nonglobal) VRF.

Workaround: If possible, do not filter ICMP unreachables based on the source IP address in the network between the Cisco ASR1000 Series Agregation Router and the sender. Apply a route map to ignore the DF bit, allowing the big packets to be fragmented, or in the contect of TCP traffic, apply the ip tcp adjust-mss < *value* > command to lower the TCP MSS of the sending host.

* CSCua12396

Symptom: IPV6 multicast routing is broken in master switchover scenarios with a large number of members in the stack. The issue is seen on platforms such as Cisco ® Catalyst ® 3750-E Series Switches and the Cisco Catalyst 3750-X Series Switches that support IPV6 multicast routing.

Conditions: The issue occurs when IPV6 multicast routing is configured, multicast routes are populated, and traffic is being forwarded. In master switchover, synchronization between the master and members is disrupted. This is seen only in IPv6 multicast routing; it is seen in a 9-member stack and either during the first or the second master switchover. No issues are seen in IPv4 multicast routing.

Workaround: Enable IPv6 multicast routing when you have a deployment with less members in the stack.

* CSCua12467

Symptom: Multicast operation and sub-opers return OK even though errors occurred.

Conditions: OK return code even though stats are not populated (for various error conditions)

Workaround: Display problem only. Fix underlying error and results will be OK.

* CSCua13082

Symptom: A PPPoE client's host address is installed in the LNS' VRF routing table with the  **ip vrf receive**  *VRF NAME* command supplied either via RADIUS or in a virtual template, but is not installed by CEF as attached. It is instead installed by CEF as receive, which is incorrect.

Conditions: This issue does not occur under a specific condition. The only condition that exists is the virtual access interface with  **ip vrf receive**  *VRF NAME* configured via the virtual template or the RADIUS profile.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua13273

Symptoms: The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers may experience an RP crash when the  **show crypto ipsec security** command is used.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Routers run an affected version of Cisco IOS-XE, and an administrator issues the  **show crypto ipsec security** command.

Workaround: There is no workaround. This issue requires that an authenticated Level 15 administrator or a configured AAA user with access to the  **show crypto ipsec security**  [command to issue the command. This is being treated as a functional issue by PSIRT and the BU, and will be resolved in a future version of Cisco IOS-XE. PSIRT Evaluation. Cisco PSIRT has evaluated this issue. This issue does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement, and will be addressed via normal resolution channels. If you believe that there is new information that will cause a change in the severity of this issue, contact psirt@cisco.com for another evaluation. Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products\_security\_vulnerability\_policy.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html)

* CSCua13322

Symptom: Routes for the converted dedicated P sessions are missing after an RP switchover.

Conditions: Converted dedicated IP sessions are not HA awared. Therefore, after an RP switchover, these sessions will be re-established at the new active RP. Routes are not installed for some of these sessions. As a result, downstream traffic is dropped.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua13418

Symptom: RP-Announce packets are being replicated across all the tunnel interfaces and the count of replication is equal to the number of tunnel interfaces. For example, if there are three tunnel interfaces, then each tunnel should forward one RP-Announce packet each minute (with the default timer configured). However, in this case, each tunnel is forwarding three RP-Announce packets across each tunnel interface. This issue is not specific to the number of interfaces. It can happen with any number of tunnel interfaces.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when filter-autorp is configured with the  **ip multicast boundary** command. This issue is seen on the Cisco 3725 Router too, where the incoming packets are being replicated because of the  **filter-autorp** command.

Workaround: Removing filter-autorp resolves the issue. However, you should remove the  **pim** and  **boundary** commands first and then reapply the PIM and boundary list without the  **filter-autorp** keyword. Also, doing this might lead to the redesigning of the topology to meet specific requirements. For example, execute  **int Tun X no ip pim sparse-dense mode no ip multicast boundary**   *XXXXXX*  **filter-autorp** and then  **int TuX ip pim sparse-dense mode ip multicast boundary**   *XXXXXX*.

* CSCua13551

Symptom: CAT 6K and ASR 1000 learning candidate default routes from nexus due to which the default route is not being learnt properly and caused an outage.

Conditions: Nexus is running into a bug CSCtz79151 because of which it is advertising the candidate defaults to its downstream neighbors.

Workaround: workaround is to configure ?default-information in xxxx? on the 6500's, where xxx is an acl denying all default candidates from being learned except 0.0.0.0/0. On 6500 access-list 30 remark Workaround for Nexus\_Bug access-list 30 remark Deny all default candidates except DR access-list 30 permit 0.0.0.0 access-list 30 remark Deny all other routes access-list 30 deny any router eigrp 109 default-information in 30.

* CSCua13561

Symptom: After upgrading to Cisco IOS XE 15.2(2)S, users cannot get the IP address via PPP IPCP from the DHCP pool on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Routers. There is no configuration change.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you upgrade to Cisco IOS XE 15.2(2)S.

Workaround: Remove the  **vpdn authen-before-forward**  command.

* CSCua14569

Symptom: The **ip vrf receive** command is not cloned to VAI from VT.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the  **ip vrf receive** command is configured before PPPoE session.

Workaround: Configure once after the session is up.

* CSCua14594

Symptom: A memory leak is seen when polling for the following PW MIBs:  `1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.1 (cpwVcPerfTotalInHCPackets) 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.2 (cpwVcPerfTotalInHCBytes) 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.3 (cpwVcPerfTotalOutHCPackets) 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.4 (cpwVcPerfTotalOutHCBytes) Address Size Alloc_pc PID Alloc-Proc Name 34417B84 308 13774B30 473 SNMP ENGINE`  `AToM VC event trace`

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 3.6S when the SNMP VC statistics query is polled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua14640

Symptom: The configuration order changes after router reload.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua14821

Symptom: Traffic loss and see ack-pend when the  **show platform software object-manager fp active statistics command** is executed. For example:

Command: Pending-acknowledgement: 0

Command: Stale-objects: 0

Conditions: UUT is using FP80 and also traffic is Jumbo frame pkt

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua14919

Symptom: IPv6 ISG session in attempting state on STANDBY-rp

Conditions: Just create one IPv6 ISG session.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua16899

Symptom: The SFP and SPA modules only may appear to be missing from  **show inventory**.

Conditions: This issue is observed after system bootup.

Workaround: Reload the SIP. This should reinitialize the SPA and SFP modules.

* CSCua16958

Symptom: The ha\_mgr does not recognize the PEER\_PRESENCE/PEER\_COMM events between the active and standby servers, leading to the standby server crashing.

Conditions: Standby router crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua18542

Symptom: When a service change occurs as ISG, SCE is not ready to accept the CoA. In such a scenario, the ISG resends an update session on the ISG-SCE Bus. The update session is sent, but it does not have the attributes for SCE.

Conditions: This issue does not occur under a specific condition,

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua18679

Symptom: The Framed IP Address is not included in the accounting start requests for dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) users and when the IPv4 is coming from a local IP pool. Accounting interims and accounting stop messages always include the Framed-IP-Address attribute (attr(8)).

Conditions: This occurs on ESP20 and RP2 with 200 branches, and two BRs each with two exits, and with delay flap on over one of ISP link.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua85239

Symptom: Flapping BGP sessions are seen if large BGP update messages are sent out and BGP packets are fragmented because midpoint routers have the smaller MTU or IP MTU configured.

Conditions: This symptom is observed between two BGP peers with matching MD5 passwords configured, and can be triggered by the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If the midpoint path has an MTU or IP MTU setting that is smaller than the outgoing interface on BGP routers, it will force the BGP router to fragment the BGP packet while sending packets through the outgoing interface.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Peering down and the MD5 error do not always occur. They occur only once or twice within 10 tests.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua85934

Symptom: A session provisioning failure is seen in the ISG-SCE interface. The deactivate or disconnect request has the message authenticator wrongly calculated.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in the ISG-SCE interface.

* CSCua91104

Symptom: The IS-IS adjacency process shows traceback messaging related to the managed timer.

Conditions: While configuring ISIS network point-to-point on the LAN interface with ISIS BFD or ISIS IPv6 BFD enabled, traceback does not always ocur; it depends on timing.

Workaround: Disable ISIS BFD or ISIS IPv6 BFD before issuing isis network point-to-point command. Restore ISIS BFD or ISIS IPv6 BFD configuration on LAN interface.

* CSCua91729

Symptom: BGP assert-enabled images show asserts pointing to bgp\_afi2priv\_topoid. However, the released images do not have asserts enabled, so these are not seen on the released images.

Conditions: The topoid access API used to fetch the topoid of IPv6 multicast in BGP needs to be changed. Because the existing API in the code does not use the correct API, the asserts are raised in this DDTS.

Workaround: There is no workaround. The code should fetch the correct topoid for IPv6 multicast for the VRF.

* CSCua91995

Symptom: IPv6 IPsec sessions may come up slowly (1 TP per 10 seconds).

Conditions: This issue occurs when the IPv6 addresses are identical in the first few bytes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua92557

Symptom: The active FTP data channel sourced from the outside may not work as expected. Other protocol inspections that expect a pinhole or door for connections initiated from the outside may be affected as well.

Conditions: This symptom was first identified on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)S3 with VASI VRF PAT FW. This issue is seen when the FTP client is on the inside and the active FTP server is on the outside.

Symptom: A reload may occur when issuing the  **show oer** and  **show pfr** commands.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you issue the following commands:

 **show oer master traffic-class performance**

 **show pfr master traffic-class performance**

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua96958

Symptom: In a rarely used configuration of PIC in a confederation, the CEF points the adjacency of the prefix via the repair path instead of an active best path in BGP and RIB.

Conditions: This occurs when the BGP flags the best path (incorrectly) and repair path (correctly) with recursive-via-connected, even though only the repair path has the gateway that is directly connected to the confederation peer.

Workaround: Make sure the gateway for the received best path is also directly connected to the CEF to choose the correct outgoing interface. This can be done by setting the next-hop-self feature on the confederation peer from where the best path is received.

* CSCua97282

Symptom: Router crashes.

Conditions: No IP routing occurs when router ISIS is running.

Workaround: Enter the  **no ip router isis**  command before issuing the  **no ip routinger**  command to perform IP routing after unconfiguring IS-IS IP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub07679

Symptom: The router may crash or generate datapath trace-back.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when one of the following conditions is met:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) MMON is enabled.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The NBAR is enabled and configured to look into IPv6 tunnels, using one or both the following CLI commands:

a.  **ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip**

b.  **ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo**

Workaround: Perform the following steps for the conditions described previously:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable media monitoring.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable NBAR classification of tunneled trafficby using the  **# no ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip** command and the  **# no ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo**  command respectively.

* CSCub07695

Symptom: The VRRP IP address owner scenario can be triggered by matching a vIP with the IP of a different physical interface.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the VRRP is incorrectly configured to have a primary vIP that is equal to another interface's physical IP address.

Workaround: Configure the VRRP to have a vIP within the same subnet of the interface on which it is present.

* CSCub07855

Symptom: A VRF error message is displayed in the router.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during router bootup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub08714

Symptom: Poor performance is seen for multicast on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers over DMVPN.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under both the following conditions:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Multicast packets should come in via tunnel interface (not a physical interface).

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The negate signaling (NS) flag has to be set on one of the interfaces in the MFIB (S,G) entry.

If both these conditions are met, the packet is punted to the control plane and forwarded in software in addition to the hardware forwarding, thus causing duplicates. Note that the NS punts are periodic/throttled, and not all multicast packets are punted because of NS. Thus, the duplication is intermittent/periodic.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub09124

Symptom: The MDT tunnel goes down.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in MVPN. If the  **ip multicast boundary** command on the noncurrent RPF interface blocks the MDT group, it may cause MDT tunnel failure.

 2. For example, RR5 is the UUT. At UUT, there is,

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Overall best path via RR1.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Best-external (best-internal) path via PE6 (client of RR5): for example, the path is called "ic\_path\_rr5".

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Initially, RR5 advertises "ic\_path\_rr5" to its nonclient iBGP peers, that is, RR1 and RR3.

 3. At PE6, unconfigure the route so that RR5 no longer has any inter-cluster BE path. RR5 sends the withdrawals to RR1 and RR3 correctly.

 4. At PE6, reconfigure the route so that RR5 will have "ic\_path\_rr5" as its "best-external (internal) path." At this point, even though the BGP table at RR5 gets updated correctly, it does not send the updates to RR1 and RR3. They never relearn the route.

Workaround: Hard/soft clear.

* CSCub12361

Symptom: When a neighbor that is not created is configured to an existing peer group, a memory leak of 1 KB is triggered along with the following error message:

 `Members of peer-group must use the same transport.`

Each time a similar command is entered, a new memory leak of the same size occurs. Therefore, this issue is not surface-impacting.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you execute the neighbor <i *p-address* > peer-group < *peer-group name* > command in the router configuration mode, where the peer group name is valid and configured. However, the neighbor is not created. For example, create a peer group neighbor rrc peer-group and add an IPv4 neighbor to the peer group. When you configure the peer group to IPv4 nei 51.3.3.2 peer-group rrc and add an IPv6 neighbor to the same peer group to trigger a transport error nei 5133::2 peer-group rrc Error, members of the peer group must all use the same transport. Check for memory leak do show mem deb leak. This will produce an entry for a newly generated memory leak.

Workaround: Avoid misconfigurations since the effect of.. is a localized memory leak.

* CSCub13697

Symptom: The embedded IP addresses in the SIP packets may not get translated as expected.

Conditions: This was first identified on a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router running the Cisco IOS 15.1(3)S3 image. The softswitch inside... was configured with static PAT for TCP and UDP port 5060 to a mapped IP address, A. The same softswitch on the inside of... was configured with bridged media, and the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router was configured with dynamic PAT overload to a mapped address, B. Also, the inbound and outbound connections were configured to use different mapped IP addresses.

Workaround: Use the static 1-1 NAT for the softswitch on the inside of....

* CSCub16403

Symptom: Timestamps are displayed as per the local wall clock time.

Conditions: This problem occurs when the show flow monitor MON cache command is issued on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running the Flexible Netflow feature.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub16463

Symptom: The bandwidth remaining ratio command does not accept  **atm** keyword for an ATM cell tax compensation.

Conditions: This issue occurs during the basic command-line configuration.

Workaround: Use the bandwidth remaining percent configuration instead of bandwidth remaining ratio.

* CSCub17584

Symptom: IOSD crashes are seen in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router MVPN sessions. When the sessions are cleared, all the IGMP joins are released, and the sessions are brought up. When about 400 to 500 IGMP join, a crash occurs.

Conditions: A crash is observed when clearing the ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router MVPN sessions on LAC using the  **clear pppoe all** command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub17585

Symptom: The system crashes and reboots with AVC1.0.

Conditions: FNF collecting HTTP fields such as host, with AVC1.0. The crash occurs infrequently in context with MSN traffic.

Workaround: Removing the HTTP fields from the FNF records will eliminate the problem.

* CSCub17852

Symptom: Improper accounting attributes are received as part of the COA account query response for lite session.

Conditions: This issue occurs whenever COA account query is performed for a lite session.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub17985

Symptom: A memory leak is seen when IPv6 routes are applied on the per-user sessions.

Conditions: This symptom is seen if IPv6 routes are downloaded as part of a subscriber profile. On applying these routes to the sessions, a memory leak is observed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub18236

Symptom: The ES, ES20, and SIP-200 line cards crash when no shutdown command is executed in the tunnel interface.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you attach to the line card and execute the shut and  **no shutdown**  commands on the tunnel interface.

Workaround: Execute the no shutdown command only for the tunnel from the RP.

* CSCub18243

Symptom: When the traffic is matched with the last statement of an ACL, the performance of the IPv6 traffic is impacted more than that of the IPv4 traffic.

Conditions: This issue occurs when an ACL with more than 20 entries and high traffic rate, hits one of the last statements of the ACL.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub18741

Symptom: Fragmented SIP packets may get dropped due to FirewallInvalidZone.

Conditions: NAT and Firewall configured in VASI interface, SIP payload needs to be translated and the length of translated ip address is different from the prenat address or PAT is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub18786

Symptom: When the Feature Navigator for the Cisco ASR1001 Router is run for universalk9\_npe image and adventerprise image, the same features, that is, they should be in sync and no extra features should be displayed.

Conditions: It is a day 1 issue, and consistently reproducible.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub19921

Symptom: Route flaps may occur after a switchover when a router is configured to use ISIS IETF NSF. The route timestamp is refreshed in the  **show ip route** command output. Packet traffic may also be dropped as a result of the switchover. Occurs with point-to-point interface or on a LAN configured as point-to-point.

Conditions: Configure ISIS NSF IETF and the point-to-point interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub20516

Symptom: The section output modifier does not work correctly for a specific sequence of commands when the parser command serializer is enabled.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you use the hardware and configuration similar to that of NTT. Invoking the show policy-map control-plane section CoPP\_PPPoE will produce the preconditions that are necessary to affect the subsequent invocation of show interfaces Port-channel1 Etherchannel | section IDBs. This produces incorrect output during the execution.

Workaround: Repeat the failed command twice.

* CSCub20803

Symptom: The EIGRP delay value cannot be calculated correctly.

Condition: This issue occurs when the nonwide metric router receives prefix from the widemetric router.

Workaround: Use the widemetric routers for both the receiver and the sender.

* CSCub21340

Symptom: A segmentation fault occurs and the router reloads continuously.

Conditions: The issue occurs when the router is reloaded with CFM over an XConnect scale configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub23298

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub24410

Symptom: In a scaled OTV setup (with 50 overlays and 2000 EFP configurations), when one ED fails in a multihomed site, the remote ED has two next hops in MLRIB for the same MAC address.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you have a multihomed setup in one site and one ED in another site, configure 50 overlays with 40 EFPs per overlay, send end-to-end traffic, and bring down one ED in the multihomed site. The third ED will have MAC addresses with two next hops in the MLRIB in some BDs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub25280

Symptom: The same inside global address is assigned to multiple inside local addresses in the dynamic route map configuration and ALG traffic.

Conditions: This issue occurs in the ALG traffic dynamic route map configuration.

Workaround: Use static or dynamic NAT configuration without route maps.

* CSCub25362

Symptom: A crash occurs when reloading a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router RP2 with multicast configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on rp2 XE3.8 mcp-dev nightly image when you reload the router with the attached configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub25419

Symptom: A Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Services Router ESP may crash at pfr\_tt\_ll\_resp\_cb when you introduce delay and flapping for TC. That is,  **clear pfr master border \*** on MC.

Conditions: Running PfR DMVPN setup with scaled number of branches, and  **clear pfr master border \*** on MC.

Workaround: No PfR session flapping.

* CSCub26079

Symptom: Service policies are not applied on the ATM interface.

Conditions: This issue occurs in the following scenarios:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The client is configured with PPP CHAP hostname peer.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A PPPoA session is established and policies 7up, and sprite are installed on the interface of UUT.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PPP CHAP hostname rate is configured on the client later.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The time policies are downloaded from RADIUS that have not replaced with the previous policies 7up and sprite values.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub26441

Symptom: A Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Services Router with ESP100 crashes if the out-of-range queue ID QID is included while issuing  **mcp\_bb\_99#sho plat hard qfp act inf bqs sch qid <**  *qid*  **>** command. As a result, ESP100 will dump a core and reload, potentially impacting traffic.

Conditions: A Cisco ASR1000 Series Aggregation Services Router must have one or more redundant ESP100s operating, and the  **sho plat hard qfp act inf bqs sch qid <**  *qid*  **>** command issued with an out-of-range QID. Under normal circumstances (when other ESP models other than ESP100 are present), the following message displayed for a bad QID:

% Error: Failed to gather BQS information for QID 0xc03, QID out of supported range.

Workaround: Ensure that you include a correct QID. there is no work-around if the fix is not present.

* CSCub26822

Symptom: When the prefix has multiple paths from the same next hop, one of these paths become the best path. Another path from a different next hop is computed for RR best external path to advertise to the peers that are configured to receive this path. The RR best external path advertised to the BGP peers may not be withdrawn when the source withdraws this path from the UUT. This may happen when the UUT BGP table has multiple paths that are the same next hop as the best path.

Conditions: This issue occurs when there are multiple paths from the same next hop in the PCP table and an RR best external path having a different next hop. When this RR best external path is withdrawn, the path is still seen in the peer that received it. The RR does not withdraw this route from the peers.

Workaround: Use the clear ip bgp <peer> command to resend the prefixes to the peer. Alternatively, use the Enhanced Route Refresh feature to avoid this issue.

* CSCub27029

Symptom: In extremely rare cases, the  **sh ip nat trans** command may cause an error message to be displayed or a crash to occur.

Conditions: This occurs rarely.

Workaround: Downgrading to a release prior to Cisco XE 3.6.0 is a possible workaround. A fix is expected, starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7.1.

* CSCub27590

Symptom: The RP crashes during the EXEC process.

Conditions: This issue occurs when you remove or readd the BGP AD L2 VFI with debug enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub27178

Symptom: The long-term service gets stuck in an attempting state and does not get established.

Conditions: This condition occurs during the following scenarios:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When the Cisco ISG session restart events are configured, service is stuck in the attempting state, or there is an IP address mismatch.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When the session churning through idle timeout or session timeout is configured.

Workaround: GGSN retains the allocated IP address for a user (tagged by IMSI for GTP) within the configured timer window. Essentially, after the first PDP context is deleted and the second one arrives, GGSN allocates the same IP address for the user within the hold time. This is achieved without the need to specify the address in End User Application - Information Element (EUA-IE) from the iWAG in the CPC. The iWAG will not maintain any binding by itself; this is GGSN's responsibility. Administrators should configure the iWAG so that the per-APN DHCP lease time matches the hold-time value. The following is a sample configuration of a session restart event:

class-map type traffic match-any TC\_OPENGARDEN

match access-group output name ACL\_OUT\_OPENGARDEN

match access-group input name ACL\_IN\_OPENGARDEN

!

policy-map type service OPENGARDEN\_SERVICE

2 authorize identifier mac-address

4 set-timer IP\_UNAUTH\_TIMER 4

* CSCub29610

Symptom: The Qos MIB filter statistics do not add up to the same number as the QoS MIB class statistics.

Conditions: This issue occurs on a Cisco 7600 Router running the IOS XE 3.7 code. This does not impact the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router and the Cisco ASR 903 Router.

Workaround: Avoid modifying the filters in the class map. If you need to modify, delete the class-map and configure a new class-map with the desired filters.

* CSCub29733

Symptom: The NAT HA feature is not going into PI20 because performance degradation issues were found with the CEF changes made for this feature.

Conditions: Any changes that we checked into resiliency@dev4 for the NAT HA feature needs to be backed out. Once that is done, we need to uprev latest of dev4 (without changes made for NAT) to 15.3(1)T/PI20.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub30577

Symptom: Unexpected RTs are attached to redistributed routes in a VRF.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the export map for a VRF contains a clause that sets both the RT matches a match as-path clause. In such a scenario, the match as-path clause will automatically match, causing the attachment to occur.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub31399

Symptom: The DHCPv6 client gives a parse error while receiving the NOPREFIX-AVAIL from the server.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the status code is NOPREFIX-AVAIL for the client REQUEST.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub31477

Symptom: A Cisco ISG router configured for Layer 2 Connected Subscriber Sessions does not respond to ARP replies after a subscriber’s ARP cache has expired.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is configured as ISG L2-Connect, the router has configured HSRP as the high-availability method, and the subscriber-facing interface is configured with the  **no ip proxy arp**  command. This issue is not seen if either HSRP is removed or the  **ip proxy arp** command is enabled.

Workaround: Clear the subscriber session. After the subscriber is reintroduced, the issue is resolved. You can also configure  **ip proxy arp** on the HSRP-configured interface.

* CSCub32500

Symptoms: The router crashes in the EIGRP mode.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on the EIGRP flaps.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub32890

Symptom: A request to include the max support user-queue information for the output of the sh platform hardware qfp active infrastructure bqs capabilities command is displayed.

Conditions The current show bqs capability command output does not include this information.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub33119

Symptom: The ?sh pl software interface fp active name interfacexxx ip reassembly? command does not display the reassembly parameter correctly.

Conditions: When the router is not configured with the reassembly max-reassembly value, it uses the default value, 16. In this scenario, the output of the sh ip reassembly gigabitEthernet 0/0/0 command will display reassembly value correctly, but the binos show platform software inter fp active name xxx ip reassembly command will not display the value correctly.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub33602

Symptom: An IGMP query with the source IP address 0.0.0.0 triggers a querier election process. As a consequence, the port on which this packet is received is marked as the mrouter port for that VLAN.

Conditions: This issue occurs when an IGMP query with source IP address 0.0.0.0 is received.

Workaround: Configure an ACL to block packets with the source IP address 0.0.0.0 and apply it to the relevant interfaces.

* CSCub33877

Symptom: During issue loadversion, when downgrading from Texel (or later) to YAP (v151\_1\_sg\_throttle or earlier), the standby RP keeps reloading due to the out-of-sync configuration.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during the issue loadversion operation. The newer version of the image supports IPv6 multicast, while the older version of image does not.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub34128

Symptom: Ucode crash occurs followed by an FP crash seen on sending GTP traffic.

Conditions: This issue occurs when traffic is sent from the SGPRS simulator.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub34756

Symptom: An RP crash is observed.

Conditions: When an RP card is hosting the TP tunnel midpoint, the RP crashes during the SSO operation.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub35526

Symptom: The output of the  **plim qos input queue**  command reflects on all interfaces of the same SPA.

Conditions: When configured  **plim qos input queue** for a interface, the configuration reflects all the interfaces on the SPA.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub36301

Symptom: The BFD sessions crash when the FP is switched over.

Conditions: This occurs when the peer is Cisco ASR1000 RP1 with large BFD sessions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub38174

Symptom: Memory leak is seen on the standby RP.

Conditions: This issue occurs only on the standby card in which the ERP interface is in the down state. Ideally, the platform should not punt packet to the ERP process when the interface is down. Also, the ERP should drop and free the memory for punted packet.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub38559

Symptom: When static recursive routes are used in an MVPNv6 environment, multicast traffic loss may occur due to a failure in determining the correct RPF interface for a multicast source or rendezvous point.

Conditions: This issue occurs if a static route to an IPv6 address at a remote site of a VPN cloud resolves via a BGP route, resulting in a failure to install the required MDT alternate next hop in the recursively referenced BGP route.

Workaround: Execute the  **show ipv6 rpf vrf X <**  *address*  **>** command for the address within the recursively referenced BGP prefix range to install the required alternate next hop.

* CSCub39131

Symptom: Packets get dropped.

Conditions: 5cps basic sip call.

Workaround: Reduce the traffic load from 5 cps to 2 cps.

* CSCub43292

Symptom: The device displays an error while using the built-in environment variable of the Identity Event detector applet called "$\_interface.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: The actual variable is "$\_identity\_interface" and not "$\_interface", which stores the value of the interface.

* CSCub44215

Symptom: In the routed VPLss scenario, when BDI interface on a Cisco ASR 1002 router is configured in VRF and receive packets on VPLs, the VFI (from a PE router with XConnect) meant for the VPN prefixes imported via route-target import from its l3vpn mpbgp peer (another PE). This corrupts the packets. The destination device drops all the packets as it contains IP option.

Conditions: This issue occurs only for the destination learned via the route target import policy. The devices behind the PE (having scanned) can ping the BDI interface, and the routes are directly connected to a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router or learned via another device in the same VRF. This issue is seen in the 15.2(2)S1 and 152-4.S.bin images.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub46570

Condition: This issue occurs when the route map is removed and then the RT filters are added.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub50946

Symptom: The bandwidth value is not correctly cloned to the virtual-access interface of the virtual template interface. When a FlexVPN client connects to the IOS head-end and the virtual template does not have bandwidth configuration, the FlexVPN client uses the default value of 100 KB.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the FlexVPN server runs on a Cisco IOS15.1(3)T or later image. The client connects and the virtual access interface gets cloned with the correct bandwidth (100 KB). When the client disconnects, and then reconnects, the bandwidth of the new virtual access interface will be 10000 KB.

Workaround: Manually configure a nondefault bandwidth on the virtual template interface.

* CSCub51087

Symptom: ODR is not working.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub51279

Symptom: A Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router resets its FP a with FW NAT feature combination.

Conditions: A Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router resets its FP with a FW NAT feature combination along with traffic.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub51527

Symptom: The line card crashes during switchover.

Conditions: During switchover, when the Tableid HA of the line card tries to open an IPC port of the new active RP, the port is not created and the line card crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub52339

Symptom: A Cisco router that runs the Performance Routing (PfR) Master Controller function may reload unexpectedly after the shutdown command is executed under PfR master.

Conditions: This symptom is not caused by any specific condition.

Workaround: Do not execute the shutdown command on the router.

* CSCub52639

Symptom: The embedded IP addresses in the SIP packets are not translated.

Conditions: This issue occurs when different NAT mappings translate to the same IP address in the header and payload.

Workaround: Use the same configuration for both header and embedded translation for the same IP address.

* CSCub53087

Symptom: A high number of GTPv0 and GTPv1 packet drops with GTP permit-error OFF. On ASA, this feature can be turned ON.

Conditions: This issue occurs when a zone-based firewall is configured for the GTP traffic and GTP permit-error is OFF.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub53660

Symptom: A stale multicast alternative route for the tunnel route is found after the level-1 interarea tunnel route is replaced by a nontunnel level-2 route.

Conditions: When multi-cast intact is enabled and shut/unshut an interface causes topology change only in level-2. The result of the level-2 SPF changes, but the level-1 topology and level-1 SPF result does not change. Thus, the stale multicast alternative route for the level-1 tunnel route is not deleted even though the tunnel route is replaced by a level-2 nontunnel route.

Workaround: Change the interface circuit type to level-1-2 or adjust the ISIS topology in such a way that the tunnel route is replaced by a nontunnel route of the same level.

* CSCub54686

Symptom: When the ultra kernel is crashes, the kernel core is not dumped.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the ultra kernel crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub54872

Symptom: When 32 prefixes are applied to an interface, for example a loopback, is not being treated as connected. This can impact the connectivity of the 32-bit prefix.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the prefix that is applied to an interface is meant for a host route (/32 for IPv4 or /128 for IPv6).

Workaround: Use a shorter prefix.

* CSCub54993

Symptom: When attaching an interface to a downstream VRF, the following warning message may be displayed even if the VRF in question does not have the IPv6 address family configured:

% IPv6 does not support hdvrf interface Ethernet0/0

Conditions: This error message is displayed only when a downstream (half-duplex) VRF is configured on an interface, and that VRF was created using the vrf definition command.

Workaround: This message is a reminder to indicate that IPv6 does not support half-duplex VRFs and that VRF forwarding configuration will be ignored for the IPv6 address family.

* CSCub55036

Symptom: A combination of static NAT and Firewall allows the flow of ICMP timestamp even though the user-defined ACL is dropped.

Conditions: NAT with Firewall for ICMP timestamp flow

Workaround: Apply an ACL on the interface to deny ICMP time-stamp request.

* CSCub55948

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on an adjacent network segment to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) and reload the box. A Cisco ASR 1000 router, that is configured for bridge domain interface (BDI) routing, may crash.

Conditions:A Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router that is configured for BDI routing, may crash if it receives crafted fragmented ICMP packets that are meant for L2 broadcast or multicast addresses.

Workaround: Under the interface BDI, use access-list to deny the ICMP packets meant for the subnet broadcast address.

* CSCuc47357

Symptom: An unexpected Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router crash is observed on Release 15.2(2)S2 SW. The crash occurred at line 3799 in ppp\_cp.c, which is in the cp\_process\_confreq()—function—from the core decode: #0 \_\_be\_cp\_process\_confreq (ppp=0x7f50114689e8, cp\_spec=0xc87fa0ec4f7f0000, cp=0x7f501035a57c, neg=0x7f50059a6084) at../VIEW\_ROOT/cisco.comp/ppp/core/src/ppp\_cp.c:3799

Below is a snippet of cp\_process\_confreq(). The cp\_get\_option\_spec() returned NULL and ppp\_debug\_prot\_s() de referenced it:

 `option_spec = cp_get_option_spec(cp_spec, option_type); ppp_debug_prot_s(ppp, PPP_DEB_OPTION_STALL, <<< Line 3799 cp_spec->cp_protocol, option_spec->name); return;... The function cp_get_option_spec() is expected to return NULL and later debug print was trying to dereference the NULL pointer.`

Conditions: This symptom was observed when more than 40 x Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers were upgraded to Cisco IOS XE Relesae 15.2(2)S2.

Workaround: A protective fix has been added before the debug print.

* CSCuc50498

Workaround: Remove ACL limit configuration with ALG traffic.

* CSCuc58603

Symptom: When using SNMP to query the CLNS adjacency table in the CISCO-IETF-ISIS-MIB, the ciiISAdjIPAddrType for IPv6 addresses is incorrectly reported as IPv4(1).

Conditions: ISIS adjacency with IPv6 enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc60435

Symptom: Packets with a single-digit MNC are not matched in the L7 class map. Instead, counters increase in the class, as follows:

`Service-policy inspect gtpv1 : gtpv1_grx_inside_mcc_mnc`

`Class-map: gtpv1_grx_inside_mcc_mnc (match-any)`

`0 packets, 0 bytes <<<< zero`

`30 second offered rate 0000 bps`

`Match: mcc xxx mnc 1`

`Match: mcc xxx mnc 1`

 `Class-map: class-default (match-any)`

`543464 packets, 11565497 bytes <<<<`

`30 second offered rate 19000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps`

`Match: any`

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the match criteria in the L7 class map define single-digit MNC as follows:

class-map type inspect gtpv1 match-any gtpv1\_grx\_inside\_mcc\_mnc

match mcc xxx mnc 1

match mcc xxx mnc 1

Workaround: There is no workaround.
