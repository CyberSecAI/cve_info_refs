{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Cisco ASA doesn't properly validate the source of ARP requests or GARP packets for addresses it performs NAT translation for. This can lead to the proxy-arp cache being polluted, causing traffic hijacking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the source of ARP requests or GARP packets within the Cisco ASA when NAT translation is performed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially hijack traffic by polluting the proxy-arp cache, redirecting traffic intended for legitimate destinations to malicious servers.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker on the local network can send crafted ARP requests or GARP packets to pollute the proxy-arp cache of a vulnerable Cisco ASA.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable Cisco ASA and have the ability to send malicious ARP/GARP packets."
