- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Squirrelmail plugin from 2004 has multiple security issues due to poor design and implementation choices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of MD5 for passwords, which is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks.
    - Direct modification of the shadow file without locking, potentially leading to race conditions and data corruption.
    - Failure to unlink empty temporary files when password attempts fail, which can lead to disk space issues if this occurs frequently.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The mentioned vulnerabilities could lead to:
    - Password compromise due to the weak MD5 hashing algorithm.
    - Data corruption of the shadow file due to race conditions.
    - Disk space issues due to uncleaned temporary files.
- **Attack vectors:** The issues exist within the Squirrelmail plugin itself. A user with access to the plugin is likely to be able to trigger the vulnerabilities, either intentionally or unintentionally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the Squirrelmail plugin.
