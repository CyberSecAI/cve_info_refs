    {
      "type": "description",
      "text": "The vulnerability is located in the `_bdf_parse_glyphs` function within `src/bdf/bdflib.c`. It arises when processing the `ENCODING` field in a BDF font file. Specifically, the second parameter of the `ENCODING` field, if negative, is not properly normalized, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write. This occurs because the glyph encoding value is used as an index into an array, and negative values are not correctly handled, potentially writing data outside the allocated buffer. The vulnerability is triggered when the second parameter in the 'ENCODING' field is a negative number other than -1."
