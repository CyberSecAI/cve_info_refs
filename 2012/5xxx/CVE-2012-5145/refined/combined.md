The security issues in V8 have been fixed in v8-3.14.5.3.

We’d also like to thank Atte Kettunen and Sławomir Błażek for working with us during the development cycle and preventing security regressions from ever reaching the stable channel. Rewards were issued.

Full details about what changes are in this build are available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=157509:164863&mode=html).
