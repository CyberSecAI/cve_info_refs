Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2012-5073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `LogManager` of the OpenJDK where permission checks were not always properly performed if the `checkAccess()` method was overridden.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Permission Checks:** The core issue is that the default Java security properties configuration does not restrict access to certain packages. Specifically, the vulnerability allowed untrusted Java code to bypass the intended security restrictions of the LogManager class by overriding the `checkAccess()` method and access to specific packages, `com.sun.org.glassfish.external` and `com.sun.org.glassfish.gmbal`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Bypass:** Successful exploitation could allow untrusted Java applications or applets to bypass the Java sandbox security model, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or access to sensitive data.
*   **Information disclosure:** In some instances, it could lead to disclosure of system information due to insufficient permission restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Java Code:**  The attack vector involves running malicious Java applets or Web Start applications that exploit the flaw.
*   **Insecure APIs:** Specifically, access to a vulnerability in the `LogManager` class' overridden `checkAccess()` method

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Execution:** An attacker could trigger this vulnerability remotely through the execution of a malicious Java applet or application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any specific credentials or prior authentication.
*   **Untrusted code execution:** Attackers need to be able to execute their untrusted Java code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources note that this vulnerability is associated with a fix in Java 6 update 37 and Java 7 update 9, as well as IcedTea6 1.10.10/1.11.5, and IcedTea7 versions 2.1.3, 2.2.3 and 2.3.3.
* Red Hat classifies the vulnerability as having an "Important" or "Medium" severity, while SUSE describes it as "important".
