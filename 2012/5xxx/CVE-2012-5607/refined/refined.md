Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a timing attack in the "Lost Password" implementation of ownCloud. The original implementation used a simple hash of a random value and the user ID to generate a token. An attacker could potentially use timing differences to deduce valid password reset tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to timing attacks. By repeatedly sending password reset requests and measuring the response time, an attacker can potentially distinguish between valid and invalid tokens, thus guessing the correct one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Password Reset:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to reset a user's password without proper authorization, gaining access to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network, by sending password reset requests and analyzing the response times.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the username of the targeted account.
- The attacker needs to be able to send password reset requests to the server.
- The attacker must be able to measure the time taken by the server to respond to these requests.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The fix for the vulnerability involved double-hashing the token. The initial token is still generated using a random value and the user ID. However, this initial token is then re-hashed with a server-specific secret before being stored. This way, even if an attacker can deduce the initial token, they can't use it to reset the password without the server secret.
- The commit diff shows the following changes:
    - In `core/lostpassword/index.php`, the token is now generated with a server-specific salt:
      ```php
      $token = hash("sha256", OC_Util::generate_random_bytes(30).OC_Config::getValue('passwordsalt', ''));
      OC_Preferences::setValue($\_POST['user'], 'owncloud', 'lostpassword', hash("sha256", $token)); // Hash the token again to prevent timing attacks
      ```
      The token is also double hashed before storage.
    - In `core/lostpassword/resetpassword.php`, the comparison is updated to reflect the double hashing:
       ```php
        if(isset($\_GET['token']) && isset($\_GET['user']) && OC\_Preferences::getValue($\_GET['user'], 'owncloud', 'lostpassword') === hash("sha256", $\_GET['token'])) {
       ```
