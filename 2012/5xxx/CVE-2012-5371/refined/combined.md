| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=875236#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-09 22:08:09 UTC  ``` Ruby 1.9.3-p327 was released to correct a hash-flooding DoS vulnerability that only affects 1.9.x and the 2.0.0 preview [1].  As noted in the upstream report:  Carefully crafted sequence of strings can cause a denial of service attack on the service that parses the sequence to create a Hash object by using the strings as keys. For instance, this vulnerability affects web application that parses the JSON data sent from untrusted entity.  This vulnerability is similar to CVS-2011-4815 for ruby 1.8.7. ruby 1.9 versions were using modified MurmurHash function but it's reported that there is a way to create sequence of strings that collide their hash values each other. This fix changes the Hash function of String object from the MurmurHash to SipHash 2-4.  Ruby 1.8.x is not noted as being affected by this flaw.

**oCERT-2012-001 multiple implementations denial-of-service via MurmurHash algorithm collision**

**Description**:

A variety of programming languages suffer from a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition against storage functions of key/value pairs in hash data structures,
the condition can be leveraged by exploiting predictable collisions in the
underlying hashing algorithms.

The issue is similar to the one reported in [oCERT-2011-003](ocert-2011-003.html)
and concerns the MurmurHash algorithm family. The condition for predictable collisions in the hashing functions has
been reported for the following language implementations:
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) (MurmurHash2),
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) (MurmurHash2),
[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/) (MurmurHash3),
[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase) (MurmurHash),
[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) (MurmurHash).
In the case of Java OpenJDK the hash function affected by the reported
issue is not enabled by default, the default function is however reported vulnerable to
[oCERT-2011-003](ocert-2011-003.html).

**Affected version**:

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) < 1.9.3-p327

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) < 1.7.1

[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), all versions

[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase) <= 7

[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) <= 7

**Fixed version**:

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) >= 1.9.3-p327

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) >= 1.7.1

[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), N/A (see References for patch commited to development branch)

[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase), N/A

[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net), N/A

**Credit**: vulnerability report received from Jean-Philippe Aumasson <jeanphilippe.aumasson AT gmail.com>,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Tcl/Tk interface for Ruby 1.9.1

tcltklib is an extension library for Ruby 1.9.1. It makes Ruby 1.9.1

 programs to be able to use low level interface for the Tcl/Tk.

[ri1.9.1](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ri1.9.1):
Ruby Interactive reference (for Ruby 1.9.1)

ri is a command line tool that displays descriptions of built-in Ruby

 methods, classes, and modules. For methods, it shows you the calling

 sequence and a description. For classes and modules, it shows a

 synopsis along with a list of the methods the class or module

 implements.

 .

 This package provides ri command and descriptions about Ruby 1.9.1.

 This package provides the ri documentation for the Ruby 1.9.1 standard library.

 The ri1.9.1 executable itself is in the ruby1.9.1 package.

[ruby1.9.1](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ruby1.9.1):
Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy

 object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text

 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,

 straight-forward, and extensible.

 .

 In the name of this package, `1.9.1' indicates the Ruby library

 compatibility version. This package currently provides the `1.9.3'

 branch of Ruby, which is compatible with the `1.9.1' branch.

[ruby1.9.1-dev](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ruby1.9.1-dev):
Header files for compiling extension modules for the Ruby 1.9.1

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy

 object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text

 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,

 straight-forward, and extensible.

 .

 This package contains the header files and the mkmf library, necessary

 to make extension library for Ruby 1.9.1. It is also required to build

 many gems.

[ruby1.9.1-examples](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ruby1.9.1-examples):
Examples for Ruby 1.9

This package provides example programs about Ruby 1.9.1.

 .

 Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy

 object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text

 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,

 straight-forward, and extensible.

[ruby1.9.1-full](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ruby1.9.1-full):
Ruby 1.9.1 full installation

For many good reasons, the Ruby programming language is split in many

 small different packages. Installing this package will make sure you have

 all the packages that add up to a full Ruby installation, with the exception

 of the Tcl/Tk bindings for Ruby, which are only recommended.

 .

 This package installs the dependencies for Ruby compatibility version 1.9.1

 (currently Ruby 1.9.3).

[ruby1.9.3](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/ruby1.9.3):
Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby, version 1.9.3

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy

 object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text

 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,

 straight-forward, and extensible.

 .

 Ruby uses two parallel versioning schemes: the `Ruby library compatibility

 version' (1.9.1 for this package), which is similar to a library SONAME, and

 the `Ruby version' (1.9.3 for this package). Ruby packages in Debian are

 named using the Ruby library compatibility version, which is sometimes

 confusing for users who do not follow Ruby development closely. This package

 depends on the ruby1.9.1 package, and provides compatibility symbolic links

 from 1.9.3 executables and manual pages to their 1.9.1 counterparts.

# USN-1733-1: Ruby vulnerabilities

21 February 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Ruby.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [ruby1.9.1](/security/cves?package=ruby1.9.1) - Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby

## Details

Jean-Philippe Aumasson discovered that Ruby incorrectly generated

predictable hash values. An attacker could use this issue to generate hash

collisions and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-5371](/security/CVE-2012-5371))

Evgeny Ermakov discovered that documentation generated by rdoc is

vulnerable to a cross-site scripting issue. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal

confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2013-0256](/security/CVE-2013-0256))

Thomas Hollstegge and Ben Murphy discovered that the JSON implementation

in Ruby incorrectly handled certain crafted documents. An attacker could

use this issue to cause a denial of service or bypass certain protection

mechanisms. ([CVE-2013-0269](/security/CVE-2013-0269))

# Hash-flooding DoS vulnerability for ruby 1.9 (CVE-2012-5371)

Posted by usa on 9 Nov 2012

Hash-flooding DoS attack reported for the Hash function ruby 1.9 series
were using. This vulnerability is different from [CVE-2011-4815](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/12/28/denial-of-service-attack-was-found-for-rubys-hash-algorithm-cve-2011-4815/) for
ruby 1.8.7. All ruby 1.9 users are recommended to upgrade to [ruby-1.9.3
patchlevel 327](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/11/09/ruby-1-9-3-p327-is-released/) to get this security fix.

## Impact

Carefully crafted sequence of strings can cause a denial of service
attack on the service that parses the sequence to create a Hash object
by using the strings as keys. For instance, this vulnerability affects
web application that parses the JSON data sent from untrusted entity.

## Details

This vulnerability is similar to [CVE-2011-4815](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/12/28/denial-of-service-attack-was-found-for-rubys-hash-algorithm-cve-2011-4815/) for ruby 1.8.7. ruby
1.9 versions were using modified [MurmurHash function](https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/) but it's
[reported that there is a way to create sequence of strings that collide
their hash values each other](http://2012.appsec-forum.ch/conferences/#c17). This fix changes the Hash function of
String object from the MurmurHash to [SipHash 2-4](https://www.131002.net/siphash/).

## Solution

Please update to [ruby-1.9.3 patchlevel 327](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/11/09/ruby-1-9-3-p327-is-released/) if you are using ruby
1.9 versions. Please update to trunk revision 37575 or later if you are
using ruby 2.0.0 preview1 or ruby trunk. In addition to it, all ruby
applications that accept input data from untrusted entity for parsing
should restrict the size of the input data to reasonable size. We are
not sure if we can provide protection against this kind of vulnerability
at programming language level in the future.

## Affected versions

* All ruby 1.9 versions prior to ruby 1.9.3 patchlevel 327
* All ruby 2.0 versions (includes 2.0.0 preview1) prior to trunk
  revision 37575

## Credit

This vulnerability is reported by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, one of the
designer of SipHash. The original SipHash implementation for this fix is
presented by Martin Boßlet, one of the ruby committer.

## Updates

* A typo fixed at 2012-11-21 22:16:00
* Originally published at 2012-11-10 04:23:00
