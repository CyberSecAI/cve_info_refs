How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

                 CVE-2012-5515
Debian Bug     :

Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities have been discovered in the xen
hypervisor. One of the issue (CVE-2012-5513) could even lead to privilege
escalation from guest to host.

Some of the recently published Xen Security Advisories (XSA 25 and 28) are not
fixed by this update and should be fixed in a future release.

CVE-2011-3131 (XSA 5): DoS using I/OMMU faults from PCI-passthrough guest

	A VM that controls a PCI[E] device directly can cause it to issue DMA
	requests to invalid addresses. Although these requests are denied by the
	I/OMMU, the hypervisor needs to handle the interrupt and clear the error from
	the I/OMMU, and this can be used to live-lock a CPU and potentially hang the
	host.

CVE-2012-4535 (XSA 20): Timer overflow DoS vulnerability

	A guest which sets a VCPU with an inappropriate deadline can cause an
	infinite loop in Xen, blocking the affected physical CPU indefinitely.

CVE-2012-4537 (XSA 22): Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability

	When set_p2m_entry fails, Xen's internal data structures (the p2m and m2p
	tables) can get out of sync. This failure can be triggered by unusual guest
	behaviour exhausting the memory reserved for the p2m table. If it happens,
	subsequent guest-invoked memory operations can cause Xen to fail an assertion
	and crash.

CVE-2012-4538 (XSA 23): Unhooking empty PAE entries DoS vulnerability

	The HVMOP_pagetable_dying hypercall does not correctly check the
	caller's pagetable state, leading to a hypervisor crash.

CVE-2012-4539 (XSA 24): Grant table hypercall infinite loop DoS vulnerability

	Due to inappropriate duplicate use of the same loop control variable,
	passing bad arguments to GNTTABOP_get_status_frames can cause an
	infinite loop in the compat hypercall handler.

CVE-2012-5510 (XSA 26): Grant table version switch list corruption vulnerability

	Downgrading the grant table version of a guest involves freeing its status
	pages. This freeing was incomplete - the page(s) are freed back to the
	allocator, but not removed from the domain's tracking list. This would cause
	list corruption, eventually leading to a hypervisor crash.

CVE-2012-5513 (XSA 29): XENMEM_exchange may overwrite hypervisor memory

	The handler for XENMEM_exchange accesses guest memory without range checking
	the guest provided addresses, thus allowing these accesses to include the
	hypervisor reserved range.
	.
	A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash. If the out of address
	space bounds access does not lead to a crash, a carefully crafted privilege
	escalation cannot be excluded, even though the guest doesn't itself control
	the values written.

CVE-2012-5514 (XSA 30): Broken error handling in guest_physmap_mark_populate_on_demand()

	guest_physmap_mark_populate_on_demand(), before carrying out its actual
	operation, checks that the subject GFNs are not in use. If that check fails,
	the code prints a message and bypasses the gfn_unlock() matching the
	gfn_lock() carried out before entering the loop.
	.
	A malicious guest administrator can then use it to cause Xen to hang.

CVE-2012-5515 (XSA 31): Several memory hypercall operations allow invalid extent order values

	Allowing arbitrary extent_order input values for XENMEM_decrease_reservation,
	XENMEM_populate_physmap, and XENMEM_exchange can cause arbitrarily long time
	being spent in loops without allowing vital other code to get a chance to
	execute. This may also cause inconsistent state resulting at the completion
	of these hypercalls.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 LTSS
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 47 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 1 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues and some bugs.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-74: CVE-2013-4553: The XEN\_DOMCTL\_getmemlist
hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does
not always obtain the page\_alloc\_lock and mm\_rwlock in the
same order, which allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host deadlock). (bnc#849667)
\*
XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\*
XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\*
XSA-66: CVE-2013-4361: The fbld instruction emulation
in Xen 3.3.x through 4.3.x does not use the correct
variable for the source effective address, which allows
local HVM guests to obtain hypervisor stack information by
reading the values used by the instruction. (bnc#841766)
\*
XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\*
XSA-62: CVE-2013-1442: Xen 4.0 through 4.3.x, when
using AVX or LWP capable CPUs, does not properly clear
previous data from registers when using an XSAVE or XRSTOR
to extend the state components of a saved or restored vCPU
after touching other restored extended registers, which
allows local guest OSes to obtain sensitive information by
reading the registers. (bnc#839596)
\*
XSA-61: CVE-2013-4329: The xenlight library (libxl)
in Xen 4.0.x through 4.2.x, when IOMMU is disabled,
provides access to a busmastering-capable PCI passthrough
device before the IOMMU setup is complete, which allows
local HVM guest domains to gain privileges or cause a
denial of service via a DMA instruction. (bnc#839618)
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1432: Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x, when the
XSA-45 patch is in place, does not properly maintain
references on pages stored for deferred cleanup, which
allows local PV guest kernels to cause a denial of service
(premature page free and hypervisor crash) or possible gain
privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-57: CVE-2013-2211: The libxenlight (libxl)
toolstack library in Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x uses weak
permissions for xenstore keys for paravirtualised and
emulated serial console devices, which allows local guest
administrators to modify the xenstore value via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#823608)
\*
XSA-56: CVE-2013-2072: Buffer overflow in the Python
bindings for the xc\_vcpu\_setaffinity call in Xen 4.0.x,
4.1.x, and 4.2.x allows local administrators with
permissions to configure VCPU affinity to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and xend toolstack crash) and
possibly gain privileges via a crafted cpumap. (bnc#819416)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-53: CVE-2013-2077: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x
does not properly restrict the contents of a XRSTOR, which
allows local PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(unhandled exception and hypervisor crash) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#820919)
\*
XSA-52: CVE-2013-2076: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x,
when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore the
FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine
portions of the state of floating point instructions of
other domains, which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive
information such as cryptographic keys, a similar
vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056. NOTE: this is the
documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is
inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant
fashion that was not addressed by the kernels. (bnc#820917)
\*
XSA-50: CVE-2013-1964: Xen 4.0.x and 4.1.x
incorrectly releases a grant reference when releasing a
non-v1, non-transitive grant, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (host crash),
obtain sensitive information, or possible have other
impacts via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816156)
\*
XSA-49: CVE-2013-1952: Xen 4.x, when using Intel VT-d
for a bus mastering capable PCI device, does not properly
check the source when accessing a bridge device's interrupt
remapping table entries for MSI interrupts, which allows
local guest domains to cause a denial of service (interrupt
injection) via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816163)
\*
XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\*
XSA-46: CVE-2013-1919: Xen 4.2.x and 4.1.x does not
properly restrict access to IRQs, which allows local stub
domain clients to gain access to IRQs and cause a denial of
service via vectors related to "passed-through IRQs or PCI
devices." (bnc#813675)
\*
XSA-45: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#816159)
\*
XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\*
XSA-41: CVE-2012-6075: Buffer overflow in the
e1000\_receive function in the e1000 device driver
(hw/e1000.c) in QEMU 1.3.0-rc2 and other versions, when the
SBP and LPE flags are disabled, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary guest code via a large packet.
(bnc#797523)
\*
XSA-37: CVE-2013-0154: The get\_page\_type function in
xen/arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.2, when debugging is enabled,
allows local PV or HVM guest administrators to cause a
denial of service (assertion failure and hypervisor crash)
via unspecified vectors related to a hypercall. (bnc#797031)
\*
XSA-36: CVE-2013-0153: The AMD IOMMU support in Xen
4.2.x, 4.1.x, 3.3, and other versions, when using AMD-Vi
for PCI passthrough, uses the same interrupt remapping
table for the host and all guests, which allows guests to
cause a denial of service by injecting an interrupt into
other guests. (bnc#800275)
\*
XSA-33: CVE-2012-5634: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 4.0,
when using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough, does not
properly configure VT-d when supporting a device that is
behind a legacy PCI Bridge, which allows local guests to
cause a denial of service to other guests by injecting an
interrupt. (bnc#794316)
\*
XSA-31: CVE-2012-5515: The (1)
XENMEM\_decrease\_reservation, (2) XENMEM\_populate\_physmap,
and (3) XENMEM\_exchange hypercalls in Xen 4.2 and earlier
allow local guest administrators to cause a denial of
service (long loop and hang) via a crafted extent\_order
value. (bnc#789950)
\*
XSA-30: CVE-2012-5514: The
guest\_physmap\_mark\_populate\_on\_demand function in Xen 4.2
and earlier does not properly unlock the subject GFNs when
checking if they are in use, which allows local guest HVM
administrators to cause a denial of service (hang) via
unspecified vectors. (bnc#789948)
\*
XSA-29: CVE-2012-5513: The XENMEM\_exchange handler in
Xen 4.2 and earlier does not properly check the memory
address, which allows local PV guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified vectors that overwrite memory in
the hypervisor reserved range. (bnc#789951)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-6333: Multiple HVM control
operations in Xen 3.4 through 4.2 allow local HVM guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (physical CPU
consumption) via a large input. (bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-5511: Stack-based buffer overflow in
the dirty video RAM tracking functionality in Xen 3.4
through 4.1 allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a large bitmap image.
(bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-26: CVE-2012-5510: Xen 4.x, when downgrading the
grant table version, does not properly remove the status
page from the tracking list when freeing the page, which
allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#789945)
\*
XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)
\*
XSA-24: CVE-2012-4539: Xen 4.0 through 4.2, when
running 32-bit x86 PV guests on 64-bit hypervisors, allows
local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and hang or crash) via invalid arguments to
GNTTABOP\_get\_status\_frames, aka "Grant table hypercall
infinite loop DoS vulnerability." (bnc#786520)
\*
XSA-23: CVE-2012-4538: The HVMOP\_pagetable\_dying
hypercall in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 does not properly check
the pagetable state when running on shadow pagetables,
which allows a local HVM guest OS to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#786519)
\*
XSA-22: CVE-2012-4537: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
the p2m and m2p tables when the set\_p2m\_entry function
fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption and assertion
failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability."
(bnc#786517)
\*
XSA-20: CVE-2012-4535: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, allows local guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (Xen infinite
loop and physical CPU consumption) by setting a VCPU with
an "inappropriate deadline." (bnc#786516)
\*
XSA-19: CVE-2012-4411: The graphical console in Xen
4.0, 4.1 and 4.2 allows local OS guest administrators to
obtain sensitive host resource information via the qemu

and (4) TMEMC\_SAVE\_END in the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) in
Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 allow local guest OS users to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference or memory
corruption and host crash) or possibly have other
unspecified impacts via a NULL client id. (bnc#777890)
Also the following non-security bugs have been fixed:
\* xen hot plug attach/detach fails modified

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 26 (CVE-2012-5510) - Grant table version
 switch list corruption vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-5510 / XSA-26
                             version 3

       Grant table version switch list corruption vulnerability

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Downgrading the grant table version of a guest involves freeing its
status pages. This freeing was incomplete - the page(s) are freed back
to the allocator, but not removed from the domain's tracking
list. This would cause list corruption, eventually leading to a
hypervisor crash.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash, leading to a
denial of service attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen version from 4.0 on are vulnerable.

Version 3.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only guests with trusted kernels will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
