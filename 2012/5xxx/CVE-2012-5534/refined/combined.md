##### Description

An integer overflow can happen when looping over items in a list.

This can only happen in rare conditions on 32 and 64-bit systems, as the list must contain more than 2,147,483,647 elements.

On 16-bit systems, this happens with a list that contains more than 32,767 elements.
##### Mitigation

There is no known mitigation.

The upgrade to the latest stable version is highly recommended.

[Commit](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/commit/710247891cdfd4e66ee6d1715e93626def6871f1)

##### Description

After changing the options `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system` or `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user`, the TLS verification function is lost.

Consequently, any connection to a server with TLS is made without verifying the certificate, which could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Connection to IRC servers with TLS is affected, as well as any connection a server made by a plugin or a script using the function hook\_connect.
##### Mitigation

After changing options `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system` or `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user`, you must restart WeeChat.

##### Description

A crash happens when decoding a malformed websocket frame in relay plugin.

This happens even if a password is set in relay plugin, the malformed websocket frame can be received before the authentication of the client.
##### Mitigation

There are multiple ways to mitigate this issue:

* Rremove all relays, see: `/help relay`
* Unload relay plugin with command: `/plugin unload relay` and see: `/help weechat.plugin.autoload`
* Secure relay to allow only some trusted IP addresses, see: `/help relay.network.allowed_ips`

##### Description

A buffer overflow happens when a new IRC message 005 is received with longer nick prefixes.

Note: a "normal" IRC server should not send again a message 005 with new nick prefixes, so the problem should be limited to malicious IRC servers.
##### Mitigation

There is no known mitigation.

##### Description

Date/time conversion specifiers are expanded after replacing buffer local variables in name of log files. In some cases, this can lead to an error in function strftime and a crash caused by the use of an uninitialized buffer.
##### Mitigation

You can unload the logger plugin, thus stopping recording of all buffers: `/plugin unload logger`.

| [Sun 18 Nov 2012 12:32:02 PM UTC, comment #1:](#comment1) Quote  Fixed in devel and new stable version 0.3.9.2 has been released.  Upgrade is **HIGHLY recommended**.   Workaround with a non patched version: remove/unload all scripts calling function hook\_process (for maximum safety). | [Sebastien Helleu <flashcode>](/users/flashcode) Group administrator |
| [Sun 18 Nov 2012 09:25:51 AM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0) Quote  When a plugin or script gives untrusted command to hook\_process, there could be a security problem, because WeeChat uses shell to execute command.   Solution: split arguments and execute command using this array of arguments, without calling the shell. Therefore arguments are not expanded by shell. | [Sebastien Helleu <flashcode>](/users/flashcode) Group administrator |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **Affected releases:** | 1, 2 |

**Description:**
