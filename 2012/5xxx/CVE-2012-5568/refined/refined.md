Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5568:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the susceptibility of Apache Tomcat to the "Slowloris" denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This attack exploits the way web servers handle HTTP requests by sending partial requests and keeping connections open, eventually exhausting server resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Slowloris Attack Vulnerability:** Tomcat is vulnerable to the Slowloris attack, which involves sending incomplete HTTP requests to hold open connections and exhaust server resources.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to consume a significant amount of server resources by keeping many connections open, thus denying service to legitimate users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service, making the Tomcat server unavailable to legitimate users. The server becomes unresponsive or extremely slow to serve requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is launched over a network by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   **Partial HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends incomplete HTTP requests to the server, which keeps connections open while waiting for the remaining parts of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server running Tomcat.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, although they do not need to be fully compliant (they are intentionally incomplete).
*  **Knowledge of the Slowloris Attack:** The attacker needs to know and have tools to execute the Slowloris attack.
*   **Multiple Connections:** The attack works by establishing multiple connections to the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Mitigation:** The provided content suggests that mitigation is possible through firewall configurations and setting appropriate timeouts in the server's `server.xml` file, specifically the `connectionTimeout` property for the `Connector`.
*   **No Official Patch:** The Tomcat project does not consider this a vulnerability in Tomcat itself and has not provided a patch for it, suggesting that the fix is through configuration and network security means.
*   **OpenSUSE Update:** OpenSUSE addressed this issue by documenting how to protect against Slowloris DoS in `README.SUSE` as part of a security update.

In summary, CVE-2012-5568 describes a vulnerability that makes Tomcat servers susceptible to a Slowloris DoS attack. While not a vulnerability in the code itself, it highlights the need for proper configuration and network security to mitigate this type of attack.
