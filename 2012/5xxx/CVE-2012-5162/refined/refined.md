Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit log for OSClass 2.3.5 mentions "SQL injections in search page and AJAX request in oc-admin (need to be logged as an admin)". This indicates that the root cause is improper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input within SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically within the search page and AJAX requests in the `oc-admin` panel. This allows an attacker to potentially manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The changelog also mentions "XSS vulnerabilities in search page", indicating that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being displayed in a web page, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts into the page viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the OSClass database including user information.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Admin Panel):** The vulnerability in the `oc-admin` AJAX requests highlights the possibility that an attacker could leverage the SQL injection to gain administrative privileges or perform administrative actions they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful XSS attacks could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites by executing arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Search Page:** Exploiting the vulnerabilities in the search page would likely involve crafting malicious search queries designed to inject SQL or JavaScript.
*   **Admin AJAX Requests:**  The vulnerability in `oc-admin` AJAX requests would require a user to be logged in as an admin.  The attacker could then craft malicious requests through the admin interface.
*   **Malicious Data:** Attackers can inject malicious code by exploiting the lack of sanitization of data passed as a parameter during a GET request and displayed in the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **For Search Page SQLi/XSS:** No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerabilities on the public facing search page.
*   **For Admin Panel SQLi:** Requires the attacker to have administrative access/login credentials.
