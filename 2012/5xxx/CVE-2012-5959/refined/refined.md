{
  "CVE-2012-5959": {
    "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the unique_service_name function in ssdp/ssdp_server.c in the SSDP parser in the portable SDK for UPnP Devices (aka libupnp, formerly the Intel SDK for UPnP devices) before 1.6.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long UDN (aka uuid) field within a string that contains a :: (colon colon) in a UDP packet.",
    "Root cause": "The `unique_service_name` function in `ssdp/ssdp_server.c` does not properly handle long UDN (aka uuid) fields in SSDP packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by sending a crafted UDP packet.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to port 1900 (standard SSDP port) on vulnerable devices.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the vulnerable device."
  }
