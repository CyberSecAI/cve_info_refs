    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `URIMappingInterceptor` in Apache CXF, a legacy interceptor for allowing REST-like access to simple SOAP services, bypasses WS-Security processing when handling HTTP GET requests when the WSS4JInInterceptor is enabled.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `WSS4JInInterceptor` skips security processing for HTTP GET requests, allowing unauthenticated access when combined with the `URIMappingInterceptor`.",
         "Lack of proper checks in `WSS4JInInterceptor` for GET requests when WS-Security is enabled through the interceptor."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass authentication and access web services that are intended to be protected by WS-Security UsernameToken or SOAP message signatures. This allows unauthorized access to the service and potentially the data it exposes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending an HTTP GET request to a vulnerable web service.",
        "Exploiting the URIMappingInterceptor which allows for REST-like access to SOAP services."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability itself."
