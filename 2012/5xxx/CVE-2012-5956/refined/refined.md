### Analysis of CVE-2012-5956

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from `www.kb.cert.org` directly relates to **CVE-2012-5956**, explicitly mentioning it and providing details about the vulnerability and its fix.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of XML data submitted to ManageEngine AssetExplorer. Specifically, the application fails to filter data fields within the submitted XML documents, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Unfiltered data from XML submissions is echoed verbatim in the HTML interface of AssetExplorer, making it susceptible to persistent XSS attacks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation can lead to:
     - Information leakage.
     - Privilege escalation.
     - Denial of service (DoS).

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted XML document to the AssetExplorer server using a POST request at `http://[hostname]:8989/discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?COMPUTERNAME=[computer name]`.
   - This submission is not authenticated, which makes it easier for attackers to send crafted payloads.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - An attacker needs to be able to make unauthenticated POST requests to the specified URL with the crafted XML payload.
   - The attacker also needs access to the ManageEngine AssetExplorer web interface to view the injected malicious content.

**7. Technical Details and Descriptions:**
   - Vulnerable Element: `DocRoot/Computer_Information/output` element.
   - The vulnerability occurs when the value supplied to this element is echoed verbatim when viewing the asset in AssetExplorer.
   - The XML data submission happens through a POST request to the specified URL, without any authentication mechanism.

**8. Patch Information**
   -The vulnerability has been fixed in **ManageEngine AssetExplorer build 5614** or higher (as per information available on `www.kb.cert.org`).

### Summary

The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization within the ManageEngine AssetExplorer application, making it susceptible to stored XSS attacks. By submitting a malicious XML payload through an unauthenticated POST request, attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when AssetExplorer's web interface displays the affected asset's information. This could lead to severe security consequences, emphasizing the importance of patching to build 5614 or higher as suggested by the vendor.
