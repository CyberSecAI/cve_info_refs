Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5333:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `page.php` script of "PRE PRINTING STUDIO" software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter in `page.php`). This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (usernames, passwords, emails) from tables such as `admin` and `users`.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could also modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Account Takeover:** By extracting admin credentials, attackers could gain administrative access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `page.php` script, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter.
*  **Example:** `http://SERVER/prestudio/page.php?id=[SQli]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious injection strings.
*   **Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs a copy of or access to an instance of the "PRE PRINTING STUDIO" software vulnerable to this SQLi.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides details on the vulnerable parameter (`id`), the vulnerable file (`page.php`), and mentions some interesting tables (`admin`, `users`) and columns that could be targeted via exploitation.
*   It also mentions a dork, implying the potential for large scale exploitation via search engine queries.
