- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Weak security permissions are assigned to certain processes when created.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure permissions on process threads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Elevation of Privilege in the context of the host. An attacker could commandeer these process threads to gain higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the weak permissions assigned to process threads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with these process threads on the vulnerable system.
