# USN-1588-1: Software Properties vulnerability

1 October 2012

Software Properties could be tricked into installing arbitrary PPA GPG keys.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [software-properties](/security/cves?package=software-properties) - manage the repositories that you install software from

## Details

It was discovered that the apt-add-repository tool incorrectly validated

PPA GPG keys when importing from a keyserver. If a remote attacker were

able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to

install altered package repository GPG keys.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python-software-properties](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/software-properties)
  -
  [0.82.7.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/software-properties/0.82.7.3)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [python-software-properties](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/software-properties)
  -
  [0.81.13.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/software-properties/0.81.13.5)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [python-software-properties](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/software-properties)
  -
  [0.80.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/software-properties/0.80.9.2)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

  -
  [0.75.10.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/software-properties/0.75.10.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

### Bug Description

add-apt-repository can add PPAs and automatically import the PPA gpg key.

Unfortunately, it uses apt-key, which in turn uses gpg to download the key from a keyserver.

gpg downloads keys from keyservers using the short key id, which is trivial to collide.

It is therefore possible to either MITM the point where gpg downloads the key from the keyserver, or to simply upload a second colliding key to the keyserver. This can result in being able to MITM packages installed from PPAs.

I don't think this bug is fixed. it looks to me like the keyserver operator (or anyone who can MITM the keyserver) can still inject arbitrary keys here.

/usr/share/pyshared/softwareproperties/ppa.py appears to run "apt-key adv --keyserver $whatever --recv $fingerprint"

and "apt-key adv" is just shelling out to gpg.

if your keyserver happens to return the wrong thing (whether by malice or by accident), it will still just get imported.

If you'd like to try, consider using the (absurdly low-fi) fake "keyserver" hkp://dkg.fifthhorseman.net:80/, which will always return my key, regardless of what keyid (or fingerprint) you request from it.

add-apt-repository --keyserver hkp://dkg.fifthhorseman.net:80/ ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa

Ah yes, apt-key still needs a fix to validate the downloaded key. Reopening.

I wish we could actually validate the web of trust on PPA keys instead of solely relying on key ids though.

By the way, this patch replaced a regexp with json.loads(): <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/quantal/software-properties/quantal/revision/77>

That was good, because a regexp could have been vulnerable to some sort of xss/injection sort of problem. But, the patch mistakenly left the following no-longer-true comment in place:

# we ask for a JSON structure from lp\_page, we could use

    # simplejson, but the format is simple enough for the regexp

That comment should be removed.

We can't really use the traditional web of trust. I trust some Launchpad PPAs, but not others, so I can't just trust any key that Launchpad has signed. The only thing add-apt-repository could do is use a local key to automatically sign when someone requests that a new repository be added, which isn't much less messy than what we have today.

Looking into this a bit I think we have various options:

- switch to hpks by default in apt-key for the keyserver requests in apt-key and refuse to do hpk

- change gnupg to reject if a downloaded key is of a different keyid than the requested key [1]

- add code to apt-key to check/fixup the commandline in adv and download the keys to a tempkeyring and check that before further importing

- fix softwareproperties/ppa.py only and download there using python-hpk or a custom implementation

Feedback welcome.

[1] This would be my preferred fix, it would involve adding a new "expected\_keys" parameter to import\_keys\_stream() in g10/keyserver.c or a new "validate\_expected\_keys()" call or something.

For the workaround in apt-key I did a proof of concept here: [lp:~mvo/apt/apt-key-recv-lp1016643](/%2Bcode/~mvo/apt/apt-key-recv-lp1016643) that shows what I have in mind. It has the added benefit that it will no longer support short keyids for --recv.

The basic idea is that if adv with --recv{,-keys} is given it wil intercept and download to a tmp keyring first, then verify that (probably unneeded though) and then export the keyid from the tmpkeyring and then importing it into the real keyring. The export via keyid step should ensure that the right keyid is used.

I looked into g10/keyserver.c a bit and had hoped that import\_keys\_stream() there could be used to test if the fingerprints match the expected fingerprints, but it seems that the fpr/fpr\_len arguments will only set to the fingerprint of the last key imported. So I need to check something else, maybe reading the spawn->fromchild stream into a tmp IOBUF, verify that and pass it on afterwards.

I'm glad to see you rejecting the short keyid.

If you're doing this work to make the apt-key fetching possibilities cryptographically sound, please rely only on full OpenPGPv4 fingerprints, not on the long keyid. And ensure that the received key is an OpenPGP v4 key, since v3 fingerprints are themselves spoofable.

Thanks!
