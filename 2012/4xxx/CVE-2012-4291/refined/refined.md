Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided documents related to CVE-2012-4291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a memory exhaustion vulnerability in the CIP dissector of Wireshark. This dissector handles the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP). A malformed packet can trigger excessive memory consumption, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability of a crafted CIP packet to cause the dissector to allocate an excessive amount of memory. This can result in resource exhaustion and a DoS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can make Wireshark consume excessive system resources, leading to crashes, slowdowns, or complete unresponsiveness.
*  The process running wireshark will consume excessive resources
*   In some instances the process may also abort.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Packets:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by injecting malformed CIP packets onto the network.
*   **Malicious Capture Files:** The vulnerability can also be exploited by tricking a user into opening a malformed packet trace file (.pcap file). This file could be crafted to trigger the excessive memory allocation in the CIP dissector when opened by Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to inject malicious packets.
*   **File Delivery:** An attacker needs a way to deliver a malformed pcap file to a user in order to cause the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction is required except to open a malicious .pcap file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resides in the CIP dissector of Wireshark.
*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way the dissector handles certain malformed packets, leading to uncontrolled memory allocation.

**Affected Versions (as per different sources):**

*   Wireshark versions 1.4.0 to 1.4.14, 1.6.0 to 1.6.9, and 1.8.0 to 1.8.1
*   Gentoo Linux: `< 1.10.1` and `< 1.8.9`
*   openSUSE 12.1 and 11.4

**Fixed Versions:**

*   Wireshark versions 1.8.2, 1.6.10, and 1.4.15
*   Gentoo Linux: `>= 1.10.1` and `>= 1.8.9`

**Additional Notes:**

*   Some sources mention that the upstream fix was not initially public, but eventually, a patch was available.
*   The vulnerability is identified as `wnpa-sec-2012-20` in Wireshark's security advisories.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla entry `848572` tracks this issue with its fix.
*   The vulnerability is listed under "Multiple vulnerabilities" in Gentoo's GLSA 201308-05 advisory.
*   The issue is tracked upstream as Bug 7570.

**Summary:**

CVE-2012-4291 describes a memory exhaustion vulnerability within the CIP dissector of Wireshark. A remote attacker could exploit this through crafted packets or malicious pcap files to cause a denial-of-service by exhausting memory. Patches were released to address this issue in Wireshark versions 1.8.2, 1.6.10, and 1.4.15, and operating system vendors also addressed this via OS patches.
