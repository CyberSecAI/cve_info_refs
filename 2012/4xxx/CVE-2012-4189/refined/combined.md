Tuesday, Nov 13th, 2012

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Confidential product and component names can be disclosed to
  unauthorized users if they are used to control the visibility of
  a custom field.

* When calling the 'User.get' WebService method with a 'groups'
  argument, it is possible to check if the given group names exist
  or not.

* Due to incorrectly filtered field values in tabular reports, it is
  possible to inject code which can lead to XSS.

* When trying to mark an attachment in a bug you cannot see as
  obsolete, the description of the attachment is disclosed in the
  error message.

* A vulnerability in swfstore.swf from YUI2 can lead to XSS.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    3.3.4 to 3.6.11, 3.7.1 to 4.0.8, 4.1.1 to 4.2.3, 4.3.1 to 4.3.3
Fixed In:    3.6.12, 4.0.9, 4.2.4, 4.4rc1
Description: If the visibility of a custom field is controlled by
             a product or a component of a product you cannot see,
             their names are disclosed in the JavaScript code
             generated for this custom field despite they should
             remain confidential.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731178
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-4199

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0.8, 4.1.1 to 4.2.3, 4.3.1 to 4.3.3
Fixed In:    4.0.9, 4.2.4, 4.4rc1
Description: Calling the User.get method with a 'groups' argument leaks
             the existence of the groups depending on whether an error
             is thrown or not. This method now also throws an error if
             the user calling this method does not belong to these
             groups (independently of whether the groups exist or not).
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781850
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-4198

Fixed In:    3.6.12, 4.0.9, 4.2.4, 4.4rc1
Description: Trying to mark an attachment in a bug you cannot see as
             obsolete discloses its description in the error message.
             The description of the attachment is now removed from
             the error message.

Confirmed. Bugzilla 4.0 and older are not affected as we use YUI for tabular reports since 4.2 only, see [bug 142394](/show_bug.cgi?id=142394 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tabular reports should be sortable"). If JavaScript is disabled, the problem goes away, so I suspect < and > are not escaped properly somewhere in our JS code, which is surprising as < and > are supposed to be escaped by |FILTER js|, see [bug 503980](/show_bug.cgi?id=503980 "RESOLVED FIXED - show_bug.cgi doesn't properly escape <!-- inside bug summary") and [bug 670169](/show_bug.cgi?id=670169 "RESOLVED FIXED - Escape '>' in js filter").Flags: blocking4.4+Flags: blocking4.2.4+Summary: Report table (version) - XSS → Field values are not escaped correctly in tabular reportsTarget Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 4.2

Are you sure this fixes all four different spots? Seems like it would only fix 2-3 of the 4.

This fixes all links when JS is disabled, prevent XSS with JS disabled/enabled and links with JS enabled are only broken when the values have semicolons in them. I will check what I can do for them later (not a regression due to my patch).

Attached patch

[patch, v2](attachment.cgi?id=660428&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=660428&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=790296&attachment=660428)

Correctly escape column headers.
I suspect that YUI reverts some escaping internally, because replacing oColumn.field by YAHOO.lang.escapeHTML(oColumn.field) has no effect. But that's another bug.

Frederic, can you give feedback on this as far as a security rating? Is this a simple XSS issue?

Unfortunately, it's very easy to trigger XSS, see the link in the URL field. There is no need for the value to exist in the DB.URL: [https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzill...](https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/report.cgi?action=wrap&assigned_to_realname=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&format=table&x_axis_field=assigned_to_realname)Severity: normal → majorDepends on: [142394](/show_bug.cgi?id=142394 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tabular reports should be sortable")Keywords: [regression](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&resolution=---)Summary: Field values are not escaped correctly in tabular reports → [SECURITY] Field values are not escaped correctly in tabular reportsVersion: 4.2.3 → 4.1.1

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
