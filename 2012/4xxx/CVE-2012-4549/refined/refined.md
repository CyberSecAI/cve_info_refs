2. If the content does not relate to this CVE, respond with "UNRELATED"
3. If no useful vulnerability information is found, respond with "NOINFO"
4. For relevant content, extract:
   - Root cause of vulnerability
   - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
   - Impact of exploitation

{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The `processInvocation()` method in `org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.AuthorizationInterceptor` incorrectly authorizes all method invocations to proceed when the list of allowed roles is empty.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control for EJB method invocations when no roles are specified.",
         "The implementation logic of the `processInvocation()` method does not properly deny access when the allowed roles list is empty."
    ],
    "impact": "When there are no allowed roles for an EJB method invocation, the invocation should be denied for all users. Due to the vulnerability, unauthorized users can access protected EJB methods.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could invoke any EJB method that has no allowed roles specified.",
        "The attacker does not require specific roles or authorization to invoke the affected methods."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to invoke an EJB method with an empty allowed roles list. No specific roles or prior authentication is needed."
