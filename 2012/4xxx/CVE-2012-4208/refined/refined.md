{
  "CVE-2012-4208": {
    "description": "Mozilla developer Peter Van der Beken discovered that same-origin XrayWrappers expose chrome-only properties even when not in a chrome compartment. This can allow web content to get properties of DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only.",
    "root_cause": "The XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox did not properly consider the compartment during property filtering, leading to chrome-only properties being exposed even when not in a chrome compartment.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Exposure of chrome-only properties",
      "Bypass of intended restrictions on DOM object properties"
    ],
    "impact": "Web content could access properties of DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted web page"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a specially crafted webpage. The attacker also needs Javascript enabled to exploit this vulnerability.",
	"additional_details": "This vulnerability exists in Firefox, SeaMonkey and Thunderbird. It is not exploitable through email in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey because scripting is disabled by default. The vulnerability is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
