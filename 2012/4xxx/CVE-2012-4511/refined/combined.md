I am even more surprised that this hasn't been already fixed with the bugfix for this bug: bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=752022 How come I am expiring the same problem now again, only with a flickr server? By the way I also don't understand why this library has to be a dependency of gnome-3. For me its useless. So for anybody coming here, having the same problem as me: If you don't need this social web stuff, you can prevent it from loading with sudo chmod a-x /usr/lib/libsocialweb/services/*   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863206#c2)  Peter Robinson    2012-10-10 19:53:23 UTC  ``` Security team: This is similar to RHBZ # 752022 can you please deal?

Subject: CVE request: libsocialweb untrusted connection to flickr

A similar request was made last year for libsocialweb connecting to
Twitter, and it seems to be doing the same to Flickr now (probably has
been all this time).

Same situation: opens an HTTP (non-SSL) connection to Flickr when no
Flickr account is configured, and without the user's permission or
knowledge.

Could a CVE be assigned to this (or has one been assigned already)?

Request for the Twitter issue is here (for reference):

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/09/3>

and the Red Hat bug:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=863206>

Thanks.

Message-ID: <1707742.pqzVoIFduu@devil>
Date: Tue, 23 Oct 2012 23:18:15 +0200
From: Agostino Sarubbo <ago@...too.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Cc: cve@...re.org
Subject: Wrong affected version in the CVE-2012-4511

The description says:

services/flickr/flickr.c in libsocialweb before 0.25.22 automatically connects
to Flickr when no Flickr account is set, which might allow remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

but Rob Bradford in the Red Hat bugzilla said:
That's odd - when I did "yum remove libsocialweb" it didn't threaten to remove
anything else (well, except libsocialweb-keys...:-)
Anyway there is a 0.25.21 on the servers for you.

and, for the record the version 0.25.22 does not exist.

So I think we need "s/22/21"
Can someone take care of this issue?
