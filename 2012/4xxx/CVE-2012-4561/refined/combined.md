Package        : libssh
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4559 CVE-2012-4561 CVE-2012-4562
Debian Bug

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libssh by Florian Weimer and Xi
Wang:

CVE-2012-4559: multiple double free() flaws
CVE-2012-4561: multiple invalid free() flaws
CVE-2012-4562: multiple improper overflow checks

Those could lead to a denial of service by making an ssh client linked to
libssh crash, and maybe even arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.5-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.3-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-30 21:23:51 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team reported many instances of overflow checks in libssh's buffer.c that were incorrect:     if ((buffer->pos + hostlen) > buffer->used) {  This should probably be:    if (hostlen > buffer->used - buffer->pos) {  It seems this could be used to trigger a large memory allocation which is immediately freed, so this is mostly harmless (not exploitable for code execution or denial of service).   A similar problem occurs in buffer_add_data():    if (buffer->allocated < (buffer->used + len)) {  len should stand on its own.   Likewise in buffer_prepend_data():    if (buffer->allocated < (buffer->used - buffer->pos + len)) {   And buffer_pass_bytes(), buffer_pass_bytes_end(), buffer_get_mpint():      if(buffer->used < buffer->pos+len)    if(buffer->used < buffer->pos + len)    if ((buffer->pos + len) > buffer->used) {   While it is not certain that any of these are actually be exploitable, the checks are incorrect and need to be fixed.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-14 16:34:18 UTC  ``` Another issue was found in src/dh.c: ssh_get_hexa(), as well as src/buffer.c: ssh_buffer_free(), and a few issues in src/string.c: ssh_string_to_char().   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c2)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:46:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 645002](attachment.cgi?id=645002&action=diff "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-possible-integer-overflow-in-ssh_g.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=645002&action=edit "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-possible-integer-overflow-in-ssh_g.patch") CVE-2012-4562-Fix-possible-integer-overflow-in-ssh_g.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c3)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:46:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 645003](attachment.cgi?id=645003&action=diff "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-multiple-integer-overflows-in-buff.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=645003&action=edit "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-multiple-integer-overflows-in-buff.patch") CVE-2012-4562-Fix-multiple-integer-overflows-in-buff.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c4)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:47:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 645004](attachment.cgi?id=645004&action=diff "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-a-possible-infinite-loop-in-buffer.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=645004&action=edit "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-a-possible-infinite-loop-in-buffer.patch") CVE-2012-4562-Fix-a-possible-infinite-loop-in-buffer.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c5)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:47:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 645018](attachment.cgi?id=645018&action=diff "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-possible-string-related-integer-ov.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=645018&action=edit "CVE-2012-4562-Fix-possible-string-related-integer-ov.patch") CVE-2012-4562-Fix-possible-string-related-integer-ov.patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-20 15:26:31 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream:  <http://www.libssh.org/2012/11/20/libssh-0-5-3-security-release/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-20 15:40:49 UTC  ``` Created libssh tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 878521](show_bug.cgi?id=878521 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4559 CVE-2012-4560 CVE-2012-4561 CVE-2012-4562 libssh various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=871620#c8)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-27 05:30:14 UTC  ``` libssh-0.5.3-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libssh](/security/cves?package=libssh) - A tiny C SSH library

## Details

Xi Wang and Florian Weimer discovered that libssh incorrectly handled

memory. A remote attacker could use this to cause libssh to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2012-4559](/security/CVE-2012-4559), [CVE-2012-4560](/security/CVE-2012-4560), [CVE-2012-4561](/security/CVE-2012-4561), [CVE-2012-4562](/security/CVE-2012-4562))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-30 20:55:49 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team reported several instances of code in libssh where a heap region is deallocated twice, first in the main path and then on the error path.  This could crash the process using libssh, or possible allow for the execution of arbitrary code.  The identified affected variables are:  agent.c:agent_sign_data(): request channels.c:channel_request(): req auth.c:ssh_userauth_pubkey(): user, service, method, algo, pkstr sftp.c:sftp_parse_attr_3(): longname, name sftp.c:sftp_mkdir(): buffer, path keyfiles.c:try_publickey_from_file(): pubkey  sftp.c:sftp_mkdir() has been corrected via the following git commit:  <http://git.libssh.org/projects/libssh.git/commit/?h=v0-5&id=4d8420f3282ed07fc99fc5e930c17df27ef1e9b2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-30 20:57:01 UTC  ``` Andreas Schneider also noted:  sftp_parse_attr_3() can be used for a DoS. It is used by sftp_readdir() and the sftp_*stat() functions. So a special crafted sftp packet to the client, which is pretty easy to do, can be sent to the client.  The server implementations are probably not vulnerable because they call the functions with expectname = 0.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c2)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 08:48:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644659](attachment.cgi?id=644659&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644659&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c3)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 08:48:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644660](attachment.cgi?id=644660&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644660&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c4)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 08:49:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644661](attachment.cgi?id=644661&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644661&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c5)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:41:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644984](attachment.cgi?id=644984&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644984&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c6)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:41:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644985](attachment.cgi?id=644985&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644985&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c7)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:42:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644986](attachment.cgi?id=644986&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644986&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-20 15:29:27 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream:  <http://www.libssh.org/2012/11/20/libssh-0-5-3-security-release/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c9)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-20 15:35:08 UTC  ``` Created libssh tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 878521](show_bug.cgi?id=878521 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4559 CVE-2012-4560 CVE-2012-4561 CVE-2012-4562 libssh various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c10)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-27 05:27:09 UTC  ``` libssh-0.5.3-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

## [libssh 0.5.3 (SECURITY RELEASE)](https://www.libssh.org/2012/11/20/libssh-0-5-3-security-release/)

 [Uncategorized](https://www.libssh.org/category/uncategorized/ "View all posts in Uncategorized")

This is an important SECURITY and maintenance release in order to address CVE-2012-4559, CVE-2012-4560, CVE-2012-4561 and CVE-2012-4562.

* [CVE-2012-4559](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4559) – Fix multiple double free() flaws
* [CVE-2012-4560](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4560) – Fix multiple buffer overflow flaws
* [CVE-2012-4561](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4561) – Fix multiple invalid free() flaws
* [CVE-2012-4562](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4562) – Fix multiple improper overflow checks

The double free in sftp\_parse\_attr\_3() could be used for a Denial of Service attack against a libssh client implementation. The sftp server implementations are probably not vulnerable. However we suggest everyone to update to version 0.5.3.

Thanks to Xi Wang and Florian Weimer for the reports, help and fixes.

If you are new to libssh read [The Tutorial](http://api.libssh.org/stable/libssh_tutorial.html) how to get started. Please [join our mailing list](http://www.libssh.org/communication/) or visit our irc channel if you have questions.

You can download libssh 0.5.3 [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files). For Windows binaries we suggest to use the MSVC and MinGW binaries from the KDE Windows project [here](http://winkde.org/pub/kde/ports/win32/). Packages for Fedora and for openSUSE are available [here](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network%3A/synchronization%3A/files/).

The security patches are available as a tarball [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files).

## ChangeLog

* CVE-2012-4559 Fixed multiple double free() flaws.
* CVE-2012-4560 Fixed multiple buffer overflow flaws.
* CVE-2012-4561 Fixed multiple invalid free() flaws.
* BUG #84 – Fix bug in sftp\_mkdir not returning on error.
* BUG #85 – Fixed a possible channel infinite loop if the connection dropped.
* BUG #88 – Added missing channel request\_state and set it to accepted.
* BUG #89 – Reset error state to no error on successful SSHv1 authentiction.
* Fixed a possible use after free in ssh\_free().
* Fixed multiple possible NULL pointer dereferences.
* Fixed multiple memory leaks in error paths.
* Fixed timeout handling.
* Fixed regression in pre-connected socket setting.
* Handle all unknown global messages.

# libssh 0.5.3 (SECURITY RELEASE)

by [Andreas](https://www.libssh.org/author/asn/ "View all posts by Andreas")|Published [November 20, 2012](https://www.libssh.org/2012/11/20/ "14:10")

This is an important SECURITY and maintenance release in order to address CVE-2012-4559, CVE-2012-4560, CVE-2012-4561 and CVE-2012-4562.

* [CVE-2012-4559](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4559) – Fix multiple double free() flaws
* [CVE-2012-4560](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4560) – Fix multiple buffer overflow flaws
* [CVE-2012-4561](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4561) – Fix multiple invalid free() flaws
* [CVE-2012-4562](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4562) – Fix multiple improper overflow checks

The double free in sftp\_parse\_attr\_3() could be used for a Denial of Service attack against a libssh client implementation. The sftp server implementations are probably not vulnerable. However we suggest everyone to update to version 0.5.3.

Thanks to Xi Wang and Florian Weimer for the reports, help and fixes.

If you are new to libssh read [The Tutorial](http://api.libssh.org/stable/libssh_tutorial.html) how to get started. Please [join our mailing list](http://www.libssh.org/communication/) or visit our irc channel if you have questions.

You can download libssh 0.5.3 [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files). For Windows binaries we suggest to use the MSVC and MinGW binaries from the KDE Windows project [here](http://winkde.org/pub/kde/ports/win32/). Packages for Fedora and for openSUSE are available [here](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network%3A/synchronization%3A/files/).

The security patches are available as a tarball [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files).

## ChangeLog

* CVE-2012-4559 Fixed multiple double free() flaws.
* CVE-2012-4560 Fixed multiple buffer overflow flaws.
