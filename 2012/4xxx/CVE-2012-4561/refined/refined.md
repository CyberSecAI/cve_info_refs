{
  "CVE-2012-4561": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to uninitialized heap allocations in several functions within the `keys.c` file, including `publickey_make_dss`, `publickey_make_rsa`, `signature_from_string`, `ssh_do_sign`, and `ssh_sign_session_id`. These uninitialized allocations can lead to an attempt to free invalid pointers on error paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized memory",
      "Invalid free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly achieve arbitrary code execution if an affected libssh client receives crafted network traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted network traffic to a libssh client.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a vulnerable libssh client."
