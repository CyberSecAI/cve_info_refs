Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4781:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory that have been deleted. This is a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability:  Internet Explorer attempts to access a memory object that has already been freed, which leads to memory corruption. Specifically, this involves the "InjectHTMLStream" function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host a malicious website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.
- Compromised websites: Malicious content can be injected into legitimate websites, including those that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- Email/Instant Messenger: Attackers may use social engineering to trick users into clicking malicious links or opening email attachments which direct them to the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website with malicious content or compromise an existing website with similar content.
- The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious page using Internet Explorer.  This is usually achieved by tricking the user into clicking a link or opening a malicious email attachment.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Internet Explorer 9 and 10 on Windows clients, and **Moderate** for Internet Explorer 9 and 10 on Windows servers. There is no severity rating for Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8, but Microsoft recommends applying the update as a defense-in-depth measure.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) acknowledges Rosario Valotta for reporting this vulnerability.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index for this vulnerability is likely to be "1" (Exploitation More Likely), given the possibility of creating consistent exploit code.
- Mitigation factors include running Internet Explorer with Enhanced Security Configuration enabled on servers (which is enabled by default), and configuring security settings to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting.
