Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4547:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is related to insufficient sanitization in the `awredir.pl` script of AWStats. Specifically, the fix addresses XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The `awredir.pl` script was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. This would allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a user's browser when they use the redirect functionality provided by the vulnerable script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `awredir.pl` script.
- The attacker could craft a malicious URL containing a payload for the XSS attack that would be processed through `awredir.pl`.
- Users accessing the crafted URL would then be subject to the XSS attack when `awredir.pl` processes the malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that contains the malicious XSS payload, then somehow entice users to visit the URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content references a previous vulnerability, CVE-2009-5020, which was also related to open redirect issues in `awredir.pl`. However, the content clarifies that CVE-2012-4547 addresses a different issue, specifically related to XSS sanitization.
