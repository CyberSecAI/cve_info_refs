Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles `javascript:` URLs when they are selected from the "new tab" page. Specifically, the script within the `javascript:` URL inherits the privileges of the "new tab" page, which has elevated permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** The primary issue is that a script from an untrusted source (a `javascript:` URL bookmark) gains access to the privileges of the privileged "new tab" page.
- **Improper Context Handling:** The "new tab" page was not correctly handling the context of javascript URLs, allowing them to run with elevated privileges.
- **Social Engineering Vector:** An attacker could potentially trick a user into bookmarking a malicious `javascript:` URL, leading to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially execute locally installed programs with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
- **Local System Access:** The vulnerability bypasses the usual security restrictions, granting malicious scripts the ability to interact with the local system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Bookmark:** An attacker would need to convince a user to save a malicious `javascript:` URL as a bookmark and add it to the "new tab" page's quick-launch cells.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to click on the crafted bookmark on the new tab page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to perform actions to set up the attack
- **Crafted JavaScript URL:** The attacker needs to create a malicious `javascript:` URL.
- **No Special Access Needed:** The attacker does not need special privileges on the user's system before the attack; it leverages the browser vulnerability to achieve the code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content reveals that the vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 17 and related updates for other Mozilla-based products.
- The fix involved implementing `checkLoadURI` with `DISALLOW_INHERIT_PRINCIPAL` to restrict the privileges of javascript URLs loaded on the new tab page.
- The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher `kakzz.ng@gmail.com`.
- Mozilla classified the vulnerability as having a "moderate" impact.
