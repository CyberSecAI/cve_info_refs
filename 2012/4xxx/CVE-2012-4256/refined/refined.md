The provided content is related to CVE-2012-4256.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The jNews component for Joomla version 7.5.1 has an information disclosure vulnerability due to improper handling of user input in the search functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: By providing a specific input (a single dot ".") to the 'emailsearch' parameter, an attacker can trigger PHP errors that reveal the full server path of the Joomla installation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of sensitive information: The full server path of the Joomla installation, as well as parts of the internal component structure, are exposed. This can aid an attacker in further reconnaissance and exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request to the search functionality of the jNews component.
- Exploitation requires a crafted input in the 'emailsearch' parameter which can be done by any user, even a normal user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges other than the ability to access the website. Any user can trigger this vulnerability, including unauthenticated users.
- No specific network position is needed, as long as the attacker can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla website.
