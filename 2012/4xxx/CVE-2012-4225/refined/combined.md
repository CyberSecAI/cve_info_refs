# nvidia linux binary driver priv escalation exploit

---

*From*: Dave Airlie <airlied () gmail com>

*Date*: Wed, 1 Aug 2012 10:10:30 +1000

```
First up I didn't write this but I have executed it and it did work here,

I was given this anonymously, it has been sent to nvidia over a month
ago with no reply or advisory and the original author wishes to remain
anonymous but would like to have the exploit published at this time,
so I said I'd post it for them.

It basically abuses the fact that the /dev/nvidia0 device accept
changes to the VGA window and moves the window around until it can
read/write to somewhere useful in physical RAM, then it just does an
priv escalation by writing directly to kernel memory.

Dave.

# NVIDIA Drivers: Privilege escalation — GLSA **201304-01**

Two vulnerabilities in NVIDIA drivers may allow a local attacker to
gain escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **304.88** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **304.88** |

### Background

The NVIDIA drivers provide X11 and GLX support for NVIDIA graphic
boards.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in NVIDIA drivers:

* A vulnerability has been found in the way NVIDIA drivers handle
  read/write access to GPU device nodes, allowing access to arbitrary
  system memory locations (CVE-2012-4225).
* A buffer overflow error has been discovered in NVIDIA drivers
  (CVE-2013-0131).

NOTE: Exposure to CVE-2012-4225 is reduced in Gentoo due to 660
permissions being used on the GPU device nodes by default.

### Impact

A local attacker could gain escalated privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NVIDIA driver users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-304.88"

```

# Security Bulletin: NVIDIA UNIX graphics driver exploit advisory.

Updated 09/29/2021 10:11 AM

## What is NVIDIA going to do about the NVIDIA UNIX graphics driver exploit?

## Go to [NVIDIA Product Security](http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-security.html)

---

This issue is listed publically as CVE-2012-4225.

NVIDIA received notification of a security exploit that uses NVIDIA UNIX device files to map and program registers to redirect the VGA window. Through the VGA window, the exploit can access any region of physical system memory. This arbitrary memory access can be further exploited, for example, to escalate user privileges.

Because any user with read and write access to the NVIDIA device files (which is needed to execute applications that use the GPU) could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain access to arbitrary system memory, this vulnerability is classified as high risk by NVIDIA.

NVIDIA is resolving this problem by blocking user-space access to registers that control redirection of the VGA window. Further, NVIDIA is also blocking user-space access to registers that control GPU-internal microcontrollers, which could be used to achieve a similar exploit.

NVIDIA is committed to security and is working on more robust solutions to prevent malicious manipulations of GPUs.

NVIDIA has released updated UNIX graphics drivers 295.71 and 304.32, which contain the fix.

The 295.71 driver is available for download at the NVIDIA FTP site:

32-bit Linux: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/295.71/

64-bit Linux: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86\_64/295.71/

Solaris: ftp://download.nvidia.com/solaris/295.71/

32-bit FreeBSD: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/FreeBSD-x86/295.71/

64-bit FreeBSD: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/FreeBSD-x86\_64/295.71/

The 304.32 driver is also available for download at the NVIDIA FTP site:

32-bit Linux: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/304.32/

64-bit Linux: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86\_64/304.32/

Solaris: ftp://download.nvidia.com/solaris/304.32/

32-bit FreeBSD: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/FreeBSD-x86/304.32/

64-bit FreeBSD: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/FreeBSD-x86\_64/304.32/

Additionally, a patch to the kernel interface layer of the NVIDIA kernel module is available, which can be used to patch older drivers, if necessary. Note that the Linux CUDA debugger will not work with older drivers if the patch is applied, though the Linux CUDA debugger will work properly with 295.71 and 304.32.

The patch and instructions on how to apply it are available at ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/patches/security/2012-08-01/.

NVIDIA provides a technical contact for information about potential security issues. Anyone who has identified what they believe to be a security issue with an NVIDIA UNIX driver is encouraged to directly contact the NVIDIA UNIX Graphics Driver security email alias, unix-security@nvidia.com, to report and evaluate any potential issues prior to publishing a public security advisory.

Subject: CVE Request: NVidia Linux driver

Hello,

Could a CVE please be assigned to the following issue:

The binary NVidia Linux driver allows local users to access arbitrary
memory locations by leveraging GPU device-node read/write privileges,
and escalate privileges to root. Possibly an incomplete fix for
CVE-2012-0946.

See:

<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/4>

Thanks,

Marc.

```
Dave,

Thank you for reporting this vulnerability. NVIDIA has released an updated
driver, version 304.32, which contains a hotfix to block access to the
registers involved in this attack, as well as some other registers which
we have identified as being susceptible to a similar type of attack. In
addition to the updated driver, NVIDIA has released patches for older
driver versions.

Details about the updated driver and the patches are available at:
<http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3140>
