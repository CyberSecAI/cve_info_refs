Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `librdmacm` library, a userspace RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) Communication Management API, was found to have a flaw in how it binds to the underlying `ib_acm` (InfiniBand communication manager) service. Specifically, if the `ibacm.port` file was not found, `librdmacm` would attempt to connect to the `ib_acm` service on a default port 6125.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Port Usage:** `librdmacm`'s reliance on a default port (6125) to bind to the `ib_acm` service, instead of relying on the `ibacm.port` file, makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle style attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bogus Address Resolution:** An attacker could run a rogue `ib_acm` service on port 6125 and trick `librdmacm` applications into using potentially bogus address resolution information. This could lead to applications connecting to the wrong endpoints, potentially resulting in data corruption or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Rogue `ib_acm` Service:** An attacker needs to be able to run a malicious `ib_acm` service on the default port (6125) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would likely need to be on the same network or have network access to the system where the vulnerable `librdmacm` application is running. They would need to be able to listen and respond on port 6125 on that network segment.
*   **Ability to run a rogue service:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a custom `ib_acm` service on the target system or a system reachable by the target system.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects `librdmacm` versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Fedora 16 and 17.
*   Red Hat assigned CVE-2012-4516 to this issue.
*   A fix was released in RHSA-2013:1661
