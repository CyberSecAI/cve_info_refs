Subject: CVE Request -- librdmacm (one issue) / ibacm (two issues)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  multiple issues has been found in tools enabling InfiniBand functionality:

Issue #1 librdmacm - Tried to connect to port 6125 if ibacm.port was not found:
===============================================================================
  A security flaw was found in the way librdmacm, a userspace RDMA Communication
Managment API allowing to specify connections using TCP/IP addresses even though
it opens RDMA specific connections, performed binding to the underlying ib_acm
service (librdmacm used default port value of 6125 to bind to ib_acm service).
An attacker able to run a rogue ib_acm service could use this flaw to make
librdmacm applications to use potentially bogus address resolution information.

References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=865483>
Upstream patch: <http://git.openfabrics.org/git?p=~shefty/librdmacm.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b5c1aa734e0e734fc2ba3cd41d0ddf02170af6d>

Credit: This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.

Issue #2 ibacm - DoS (ib_acm deamon crash) by joining responses for multicast destinations:
===========================================================================================
  A denial of service flaw was found in the way ibacm, an InfiniBand communication manager
assistant, performed management of reference counts for multicast connections. The default
reference count value for multicast connection is set to zero and when the multicast connection
got released, an attempt was made to free it, possibly resulting in ib_acm service / daemon
crash.

References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=865492>
Relevant upstream patch: <http://git.openfabrics.org/git?p=~shefty/ibacm.git;a=commit;h=c7d28b35d64333c262de3ec972c426423dadccf9>

Issue previously corrected by upstream and its security implications pointed out later
by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.

Issue #3 ibacm - ib_acm service files created with world writable permissions (DoS):
====================================================================================
  A security flaw was found in the way ibacm, an InfiniBand communication manager
assistant, created files used by ib_acm service - they were created with world
writable permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to 1) overwrite content
of ib_acm daemon log file or 2) overwrite content of ib_acm daemon ibacm.port file
(ability to mask certain actions or cause ib_acm to run on non-default port).

References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=865499>
Relevant upstream patch: <http://git.openfabrics.org/git?p=~shefty/ibacm.git;a=commit;h=d204fca2b6298d7799e918141ea8e11e7ad43cec>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=865483#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-11 14:49:16 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way librdmacm, a userspace RDMA Communication Managment API allowing to specify connections using TCP/IP addresses even though it opens RDMA specific connections, performed binding to the underlying ib_acm service (librdmacm used default port value of 6125 to bind to ib_acm service). An attacker able to run a rogue ib_acm service could use this flaw to make librdmacm applications to use potentially bogus address resolution information.  Upstream patch: [1] <http://git.openfabrics.org/git?p=~shefty/librdmacm.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b5c1aa734e0e734fc2ba3cd41d0ddf02170af6d>  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=865483#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-11 14:51:18 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the version of the librdmacm package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  --  This issue affects the version of the librdmacm package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the librdmacm package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.
