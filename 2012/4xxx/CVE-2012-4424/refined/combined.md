| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c0)  Joseph Myers    2012-09-05 20:59:31 UTC  ``` The code in string/strcoll_l.c that computes a memory allocation size as (s1len + s2len) * (sizeof (int32_t) + 1) fails to allow for possible integer overflow in this computation.  On a 32-bit host this can cause too-small allocations and consequent buffer overflow if the strings total more than 0.8GB.  Testcase:  #include <locale.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h>  #define SIZE 429496730  int main (void) {   char *p = malloc (1 + SIZE);   if (setlocale (LC_COLLATE, "en_GB.UTF-8") == NULL)     {       puts ("setlocale failed, cannot test for overflow");       return 0;     }   if (p == NULL)     {       puts ("malloc failed, cannot test for overflow");       return 0;     }   memset (p, 'x', SIZE);   p[SIZE] = 0;   printf ("%d\n", strcoll (p, p));   return 0; } ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c1)  Joseph Myers    2012-09-05 21:12:50 UTC  ``` It looks like the same issue is also present in strxfrm (not tested). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c2)  Joseph Myers    2012-09-06 16:54:00 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 14552](show_bug.cgi?id=14552 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Two security issues in strcoll() function") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c3)  Rich Felker    2012-09-08 03:38:25 UTC  ``` Although this bug report regards the serious security vuln in strcoll, even if the overflow issues are fixed, a serious bug will remain. The strcoll interface does not permit failure. It must yield a consistent ordering. If it can fail sporadically from memory exhaustion, it can cause other interfaces using it (such as qsort) which rely on it to be a consistent ordering to invoke undefined behavior. While an immediate security fix is needed for the issues reported here, the implementation of strcoll calls for drastic redesign to be completely free of malloc or any other operation that could fail. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c4)  Shaun Colley    2012-09-11 09:53:33 UTC  ``` I've detailed another strcoll() security vulnerability below, which is an unbounded alloca() call.   alloca() stack overflow  If the malloc() call in alloca() fails (i.e. OOM conditions), strcoll() will failsafe to alloca() for allocating its memory, which could result in unbounded alloca() calls and exploitable conditions if the stack pointer is shifted over the guard area and into the heap. See vulnerable code below.          if (idx1arr == NULL)        /* No memory.  Well, go with the stack then.

For very large string     inputs, the cache size computation could overflow.  In such a case,     use the fallback function that does not cache indices and weights of     collation sequences.          Fixes CVE-2012-4412.  commit 141f3a77fe4f1b59b0afa9bf6909cd2000448883 Author: Siddhesh Poyarekar <siddhesh@redhat.com> Date:   Mon Sep 23 11:20:02 2013 +0530      Fall back to non-cached sequence traversal and comparison on malloc fail          strcoll currently falls back to alloca if malloc fails, resulting in a     possible stack overflow.  This patch implements sequence traversal and     comparison without caching indices and rules.          Fixes CVE-2012-4424. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c8)  mancha    2013-10-25 13:09:56 UTC  ``` Hello.

It should finish a few minutes before forever :)  The *_nocache code is O(n^3) (IIRC), so it's very very slow.  If it has to crash due to a buffer or stack overflow, it ought to be gone in a few minutes based on some arbitrary tests I did by introducing buffer overflows and accesses beyond bounds in the code.  I've added an xtest (i.e. an optional test, which you can run using `make xcheck`) that does exactly this - run the reproducer and signal a success if the program doesn't crash in about five minutes.  If you want to do a correctness test then I'd suggest commenting out the get_next_seq_cached paths so that get_next_seq_nocache is called all the time and then run your usual strcoll correctness tests.  Maybe we could add some internal test hooks that allow us to do this seamlessly. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c11)  mancha    2013-10-25 15:03:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Siddhesh Poyarekar from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c10)) > It should finish a few minutes before forever :) >  > The *_nocache code is O(n^3) (IIRC), so it's very very slow.  Hi. Thanks for your quick reply. With that kind of complexity I'll adopt your heuristic: if no failure in 5 minutes, assume success.  > If you want to do a correctness test then I'd suggest commenting out the > get_next_seq_cached paths so that get_next_seq_nocache is called all the > time and then run your usual strcoll correctness tests.  Thanks for the suggestion, I'll force get_next_seq_nocache and run my strcoll faithfulness tests. ```   [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c12)  Jackie Rosen    2014-02-16 19:41:09 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` *** Bug 260998 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Seen from the domain <http://volichat.com> Page where seen: <http://volichat.com/adult-chat-rooms> Marked for reference.

# USN-1991-1: GNU C Library vulnerabilities

21 October 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the GNU C Library.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [eglibc](/security/cves?package=eglibc) - GNU C Library

## Details

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled the strcoll()

function. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-4412](/security/CVE-2012-4412), [CVE-2012-4424](/security/CVE-2012-4424))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled multibyte

characters in the regular expression matcher. An attacker could use this

issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0242](/security/CVE-2013-0242))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled large numbers

of domain conversion results in the getaddrinfo() function. An attacker

could use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1914](/security/CVE-2013-1914))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library readdir\_r() function incorrectly

handled crafted NTFS or CIFS images. An attacker could use this issue to

cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2013-4237](/security/CVE-2013-4237))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled memory

allocation. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2013-4332](/security/CVE-2013-4332))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=858238#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-18 12:12:14 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way strcoll() interface of glibc, the GNU libc libraries, performed failsafe back to alloca() routine when malloc() function call failed previously (due to out of memory [OOM] condition for example). If an application linked against glibc was missing an application-level sanity checks for validity of strcoll() arguments and accepted untrusted input, an attacker could use this flaw to cause the particular application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  Upstream bug report (including the reproducer): [1] <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14552#c0>  Issue / part: 1) alloca() stack overflow from [1].
