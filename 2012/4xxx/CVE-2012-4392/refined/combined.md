## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

Subject: ownCloud - matching CVEs to fix information and vice versa

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Ok so I started looking at ownCloud to make sure I didn't issue a
duplicate.

We have the following 4 CVE entries for ownCloud and no way to match
them to a fixed version.

CVE-2012-2398	Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
files/ajax/download.php in ownCloud 3.0.2 allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the files parameter, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2012-2269.4. NOTE: the provenance of
this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from
third party information.

Is CVE-2012-2398 fixed in 3.0.3?

CVE-2012-2397	Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
ownCloud 3.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of
arbitrary users for requests that insert cross-site scripting (XSS)
sequences via vectors involving contacts. NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
party information.

Is CVE-2012-2397 fixed in 3.0.3?

CVE-2012-2270	Open redirect vulnerability in index.php (aka the Login
Page) in ownCloud 3.0.0 allows remote attackers to redirect users to
arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the
redirect_url parameter.

Is CVE-2012-2270 fixed in 3.0.1?

CVE-2012-2269	Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
ownCloud 3.0.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via (1) an arbitrary field to apps/contacts/ajax/addcard.php,
(2) the parameter parameter to apps/contacts/ajax/addproperty.php, (3)
the name parameter to apps/contacts/ajax/createaddressbook, (4) the
file parameter to files/download.php, or the (5) name, (6) user, or
(7) redirect_url parameter to files/index.php.

Is CVE-2012-2269 fixed in 3.0.1
