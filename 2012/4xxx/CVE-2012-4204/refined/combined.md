# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-96

## Memory corruption in str\_unescape

Announced
November 20, 2012
Reporter
Scott Bell
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 17
* SeaMonkey 2.14
* Thunderbird 17

### Description

Security researcher **Scott Bell** of Security-Assessment.com used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a memory corruption in `str_unescape` in the Javascript engine. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

## Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new packages introduced

regressions in cookies handling and the User Agent string. This update fixes

the problem.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

## Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript

enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript

code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:1592-1
Rating: important
References: #790140
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 for VMware
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP2

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 10.0.11 ESR
security release, which fixes various bugs and security
issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-106: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series critically
rated of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and memory
corruption issues in shipped software. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
execution. We would also like to thank miaubiz for
reporting two additional use-after-free and memory
corruption issues introduced during Firefox development
that have been fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o use-after-free when loading html file on osx
(CVE-2012-5830) o Mesa crashes on certain texImage2D calls
involving level>0 (CVE-2012-5833) o integer overflow,
invalid write w/webgl bufferdata (CVE-2012-5835)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o crash in copyTexImage2D with image dimensions
too large for given level (CVE-2012-5838)
\*
MFSA 2012-105: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer
overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped
software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting five additional
use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow
flaws introduced during Firefox development that have been
fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditorState::PrepareEditor (CVE-2012-4214) o
Heap-use-after-free in
nsPlaintextEditor::FireClipboardEvent (CVE-2012-4215) o
Heap-use-after-free in gfxFont::GetFontEntry
(CVE-2012-4216) o Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWindow::OnExposeEvent (CVE-2012-5829) o
heap-buffer-overflow in
gfxShapedWord::CompressedGlyph::IsClusterStart o
CVE-2012-5839 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditorState::PrepareEditor (CVE-2012-5840)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o Heap-use-after-free in XPCWrappedNative::Mark
(CVE-2012-4212) o Heap-use-after-free in
nsEditor::FindNextLeafNode (CVE-2012-4213) o
Heap-use-after-free in nsViewManager::ProcessPendingUpdates
(CVE-2012-4217) o Heap-use-after-free
BuildTextRunsScanner::BreakSink::SetBreaks (CVE-2012-4218)
\*
MFSA 2012-104 / CVE-2012-4210: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a maliciously crafted
stylesheet is inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and
CSS can run in a chrome privileged context without being
properly sanitized first. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-103 / CVE-2012-4209: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a
frame whose name attribute's value is set to "top". This
can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-102 / CVE-2012-5837: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that when script is entered into
the Developer Toolbar, it runs in a chrome privileged
context. This allows for arbitrary code execution or
cross-site scripting (XSS) if a user can be convinced to
paste malicious code into the Developer Toolbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-101 / CVE-2012-4207: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa found when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is
used for text, the "~" character will destroy another
character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in
HZ-GB-2312.
\*
MFSA 2012-100 / CVE-2012-5841: Mozilla developer
Bobby Holley reported that security wrappers filter at the
time of property access, but once a function is returned,
the caller can use this function without further security
checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for
write actions on objects when only read actions should be
properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-99 / CVE-2012-4208: Mozilla developer Peter
Van der Beken discovered that same-origin XrayWrappers
expose chrome-only properties even when not in a chrome
compartment. This can allow web content to get properties
of DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-98 / CVE-2012-4206: Security researcher
Robert Kugler reported that when a specifically named DLL
file on a Windows computer is placed in the default
downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the Firefox
installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In
circumstances where the installer is run by an
administrator privileged account, this allows for the
downloaded DLL file to be run with administrator
privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution from
a privileged account.
\*
MFSA 2012-97 / CVE-2012-4205: Mozilla developer Gabor
Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created
within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the
sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running
untrusted code in a sandbox.
\*
MFSA 2012-96 / CVE-2012-4204: Security researcher
Scott Bell of Security-Assessment.com used the Address
Sanitizer tool to discover a memory corruption in
str\_unescape in the Javascript engine. This could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-95 / CVE-2012-4203: Security researcher
kakzz.ng@gmail.com reported that if a javascript: URL is
selected from the list of Firefox "new tab" page, the
script will inherit the privileges of the privileged "new
tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally
installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a
bookmark of a malicious javascript: URL.
\*
MFSA 2012-94 / CVE-2012-5836: Security researcher
Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining SVG text on a
path with the setting of CSS properties could lead to a
potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-93 / CVE-2012-4201: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that if code executed by
the evalInSandbox function sets location.href, it can get
the wrong subject principal for the URL check, ignoring the
sandbox's Javascript context and gaining the context of
evalInSandbox object. This can lead to malicious web
content being able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack or stealing a copy of a local file if the user has
installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-92 / CVE-2012-4202: Security researcher
Atte Kettunen from OUSPG used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format
images. This issue is potentially exploitable and could
lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-91: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=778603#c0)• 12 years ago |
|  | |

I ran into this issue while fuzzing. ASAN reports this as a heap overflow. I wasn't able to symbolize the ASAN output for some unknown reason. However, I see it crashing at strange locations on different runs on optimized builds.
In debug builds, it hits this assertion and crashes @ NULL:
Assertion failure: mLength + 1 <= mReserved, at ./../../dist/include/js/Vector.h:788
Windbg references this code: mozjs!str\_unescape+0x23e [e:\builds\moz2\_slave\rel-m-rel-w32-bld\build\js\src\jsstr.cpp @ 352]
I have attached some logs from both debug and optimized builds.

Thanks for reporting! The test-case reproduces in the shell. A debug build asserts early reporting a call to infallibleAppend that has not reserved enough space.
[Bug 708873](/show_bug.cgi?id=708873 "RESOLVED FIXED - Write unescape to match spec and document StringBuffer API's memory usage characteristics") seems to be at fault; unfortunately the author is gone and the reviewer is on vacation. I guess I'll look at it.

Per luke's request, I landed this fix on m-c inside an inbound merge commit rather than with its own changeset. You can confirm that the fix is present there.

This bug was marked sec-high early before we understood the nature of the vulnerability. Understanding what the bug is now (out of bounds read), is that still appropriate? Will any part of this code write into an area assuming there's enough space because of the bogus length or it is only the read path that goes wrong?Flags: needinfo?(luke)Keywords: [regression](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&resolution=---)

IIRC, there was the possibility of writing past the end of the buffer (infallibleAppend is being used), so this sec-high sounds appropriate.Flags: needinfo?(luke)

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information
