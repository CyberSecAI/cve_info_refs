- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The 3S CODESYS Gateway-Server uses external input to construct a pathname for file or directory access. However, it fails to properly neutralize special elements within the path, allowing it to resolve to locations outside the intended restricted directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory or path traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to create files in arbitrary locations. This could lead to remote code execution, as demonstrated by a Metasploit module that creates a .mof file for this purpose.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted directory path over the network to the affected server, TCP/1211.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable CODESYS Gateway-Server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
