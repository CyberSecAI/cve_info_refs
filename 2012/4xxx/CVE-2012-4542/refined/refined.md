  "CVE-2012-4542": {
    "description": "It was found that the default SCSI command filter does not accommodate commands that overlap across device classes. A privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to write arbitrary data to a LUN that is passed-through as read-only.",
    "root_cause": "The default SCSI command filter does not properly handle overlapping commands across different device classes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate command filtering for SCSI devices",
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user could write arbitrary data to a read-only LUN.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the lack of proper validation in the SCSI command filter.",
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A privileged user in a virtualized guest system."
