## Synopsis

Moderate: xen security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0241)

## Topic

Updated xen packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux.

A flaw was found in the way libxc, the Xen control library, handled
excessively large kernel and ramdisk images when starting new guests. A
privileged guest user in a para-virtualized guest (a DomU) could create a
crafted kernel or ramdisk image that, when attempting to use it during
guest start, could result in an out-of-memory condition in the privileged
domain (the Dom0). (CVE-2012-4544)

Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.

All users of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct this issue. After installing the updated packages, the xend service
must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\* XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\* XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\* XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\* XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\* XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\* XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\* XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\* XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\* XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\* XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 47 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 1 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues and some bugs.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-74: CVE-2013-4553: The XEN\_DOMCTL\_getmemlist
hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does
not always obtain the page\_alloc\_lock and mm\_rwlock in the
same order, which allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host deadlock). (bnc#849667)
\*
XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\*
XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\*
XSA-66: CVE-2013-4361: The fbld instruction emulation
in Xen 3.3.x through 4.3.x does not use the correct
variable for the source effective address, which allows
local HVM guests to obtain hypervisor stack information by
reading the values used by the instruction. (bnc#841766)
\*
XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\*
XSA-62: CVE-2013-1442: Xen 4.0 through 4.3.x, when
using AVX or LWP capable CPUs, does not properly clear
previous data from registers when using an XSAVE or XRSTOR
to extend the state components of a saved or restored vCPU
after touching other restored extended registers, which
allows local guest OSes to obtain sensitive information by
reading the registers. (bnc#839596)
\*
XSA-61: CVE-2013-4329: The xenlight library (libxl)
in Xen 4.0.x through 4.2.x, when IOMMU is disabled,
provides access to a busmastering-capable PCI passthrough
device before the IOMMU setup is complete, which allows
local HVM guest domains to gain privileges or cause a
denial of service via a DMA instruction. (bnc#839618)
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1432: Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x, when the
XSA-45 patch is in place, does not properly maintain
references on pages stored for deferred cleanup, which
allows local PV guest kernels to cause a denial of service
(premature page free and hypervisor crash) or possible gain
privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-57: CVE-2013-2211: The libxenlight (libxl)
toolstack library in Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x uses weak
permissions for xenstore keys for paravirtualised and
emulated serial console devices, which allows local guest
administrators to modify the xenstore value via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#823608)
\*
XSA-56: CVE-2013-2072: Buffer overflow in the Python
bindings for the xc\_vcpu\_setaffinity call in Xen 4.0.x,
4.1.x, and 4.2.x allows local administrators with
permissions to configure VCPU affinity to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and xend toolstack crash) and
possibly gain privileges via a crafted cpumap. (bnc#819416)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-53: CVE-2013-2077: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x
does not properly restrict the contents of a XRSTOR, which
allows local PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(unhandled exception and hypervisor crash) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#820919)
\*
XSA-52: CVE-2013-2076: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x,
when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore the
FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine
portions of the state of floating point instructions of
other domains, which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive
information such as cryptographic keys, a similar
vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056. NOTE: this is the
documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is
inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant
fashion that was not addressed by the kernels. (bnc#820917)
\*
XSA-50: CVE-2013-1964: Xen 4.0.x and 4.1.x
incorrectly releases a grant reference when releasing a
non-v1, non-transitive grant, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (host crash),
obtain sensitive information, or possible have other
impacts via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816156)
\*
XSA-49: CVE-2013-1952: Xen 4.x, when using Intel VT-d
for a bus mastering capable PCI device, does not properly
check the source when accessing a bridge device's interrupt
remapping table entries for MSI interrupts, which allows
local guest domains to cause a denial of service (interrupt
injection) via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816163)
\*
XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\*
XSA-46: CVE-2013-1919: Xen 4.2.x and 4.1.x does not
properly restrict access to IRQs, which allows local stub
domain clients to gain access to IRQs and cause a denial of
service via vectors related to "passed-through IRQs or PCI
devices." (bnc#813675)
\*
XSA-45: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#816159)
\*
XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\*
XSA-41: CVE-2012-6075: Buffer overflow in the
e1000\_receive function in the e1000 device driver
(hw/e1000.c) in QEMU 1.3.0-rc2 and other versions, when the
SBP and LPE flags are disabled, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary guest code via a large packet.
(bnc#797523)
\*
XSA-37: CVE-2013-0154: The get\_page\_type function in
xen/arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.2, when debugging is enabled,
allows local PV or HVM guest administrators to cause a
denial of service (assertion failure and hypervisor crash)
via unspecified vectors related to a hypercall. (bnc#797031)
\*
XSA-36: CVE-2013-0153: The AMD IOMMU support in Xen
4.2.x, 4.1.x, 3.3, and other versions, when using AMD-Vi
for PCI passthrough, uses the same interrupt remapping
table for the host and all guests, which allows guests to
cause a denial of service by injecting an interrupt into
other guests. (bnc#800275)
\*
XSA-33: CVE-2012-5634: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 4.0,
when using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough, does not
properly configure VT-d when supporting a device that is
behind a legacy PCI Bridge, which allows local guests to
cause a denial of service to other guests by injecting an
interrupt. (bnc#794316)
\*
XSA-31: CVE-2012-5515: The (1)
XENMEM\_decrease\_reservation, (2) XENMEM\_populate\_physmap,
and (3) XENMEM\_exchange hypercalls in Xen 4.2 and earlier
allow local guest administrators to cause a denial of
service (long loop and hang) via a crafted extent\_order
value. (bnc#789950)
\*
XSA-30: CVE-2012-5514: The
guest\_physmap\_mark\_populate\_on\_demand function in Xen 4.2
and earlier does not properly unlock the subject GFNs when
checking if they are in use, which allows local guest HVM
administrators to cause a denial of service (hang) via
unspecified vectors. (bnc#789948)
\*
XSA-29: CVE-2012-5513: The XENMEM\_exchange handler in
Xen 4.2 and earlier does not properly check the memory
address, which allows local PV guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified vectors that overwrite memory in
the hypervisor reserved range. (bnc#789951)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-6333: Multiple HVM control
operations in Xen 3.4 through 4.2 allow local HVM guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (physical CPU
consumption) via a large input. (bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-5511: Stack-based buffer overflow in
the dirty video RAM tracking functionality in Xen 3.4
through 4.1 allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a large bitmap image.
(bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-26: CVE-2012-5510: Xen 4.x, when downgrading the
grant table version, does not properly remove the status
page from the tracking list when freeing the page, which
allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#789945)
\*
XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)
\*
XSA-24: CVE-2012-4539: Xen 4.0 through 4.2, when
running 32-bit x86 PV guests on 64-bit hypervisors, allows
local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and hang or crash) via invalid arguments to
GNTTABOP\_get\_status\_frames, aka "Grant table hypercall
infinite loop DoS vulnerability." (bnc#786520)
\*
XSA-23: CVE-2012-4538: The HVMOP\_pagetable\_dying
hypercall in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 does not properly check
the pagetable state when running on shadow pagetables,
which allows a local HVM guest OS to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#786519)
\*
XSA-22: CVE-2012-4537: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
the p2m and m2p tables when the set\_p2m\_entry function
fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption and assertion
failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability."
(bnc#786517)
\*
XSA-20: CVE-2012-4535: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that fixes 15 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 3 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues:
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-20: CVE-2012-4535: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, allows local guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (Xen infinite
loop and physical CPU consumption) by setting a VCPU with
an "inappropriate deadline". (bnc#786516)
\*
XSA-22: CVE-2012-4537: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
the p2m and m2p tables when the set\_p2m\_entry function
fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption and assertion
failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability".
(bnc#786517)
\*
XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)
\*
XSA-29: CVE-2012-5513: The XENMEM\_exchange handler in
Xen 4.2 and earlier does not properly check the memory
address, which allows local PV guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified vectors that overwrite memory in
the hypervisor reserved range. (bnc#789951)
\*
XSA-31: CVE-2012-5515: The (1)
XENMEM\_decrease\_reservation, (2) XENMEM\_populate\_physmap,
and (3) XENMEM\_exchange hypercalls in Xen 4.2 and earlier
allow local guest administrators to cause a denial of
service (long loop and hang) via a crafted extent\_order
value. (bnc#789950)
\*
XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\*
XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\*
XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\*
XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 25 (CVE-2012-4544) - Xen domain builder
 Out-of-memory due to malicious kernel/ramdisk

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-4544 / XSA-25

   Xen domain builder Out-of-memory due to malicious kernel/ramdisk

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The Xen PV domain builder contained no validation of the size of the
supplied kernel or ramdisk either before or after decompression. This
could cause the toolstack to consume all available RAM in the domain
running the domain builder.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator who can supply a kernel or ramdisk can
exhaust memory in domain 0 leading to a denial of service attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only trusted kernels and ramdisks will avoid this
vulnerability.

Using pvgrub also avoids this vulnerability since the builder will run
in guest context. (nb: use of pygrub *is* vulnerable).

Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.

RELATED ISSUE
=============

CVE-2012-2625 covers a bug in pygrub which caused that process to
consume excessive amount of memory under similar circumstances to the
above.

This was fixed in xen-unstable (and the fix inherited by Xen 4.2.x) in
revision 25589:60f09d1ab1fe but not called out as a security problem.
This fix is also included, where relevant, in the patches below.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue, including
the related pygrub fix where neccesary.

xsa25-unstable.patch        Xen unstable
xsa25-4.2.patch             Xen 4.2.x
xsa25-4.1.patch             Xen 4.1.x

$ sha256sum xsa25*.patch
613e4b82cdc9cabf9cbd52076118887b298c47e680c2066a28a77f12e9f90606  xsa25-4.1.patch
135bc089d003f9b97991764c37b1ab8d37e9cbcfa1b9bd7429b4503abe00c8f5  xsa25-4.2.patch
534495b7eef6e599f5814f0a67fc84fbe2e8eee9d223a09ad178ff63bdcda3dd  xsa25-unstable.patch

Note that these patches impose a new size limit of 1Gby on both the
compressed and uncompressed sizes of ramdisks.  On some systems it may
be desirable to relax these limits and risk virtual address or memory
exhaustion in the toolstack.  This can be achieved by setting
XC_DOM_DECOMPRESS_MAX to the desired limit (in bytes). This can be
done by building with "APPEND_CFLAGS=-DXC_DOM_DECOMPRESS_MAX=<limit>"
or by editing tools/libxc/xc_dom.h directly.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

These issues have already been discussed in public in various places,
including <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-2625>
and <http://bugs.debian.org/688125>.  This advisory is therefore not
subject to an embargo.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-4544

    Insufficient validation of kernel or ramdisk sizes in the Xen PV
    domain builder could result in denial of service.

CVE-2012-5511

    Several HVM control operations performed insufficient validation of
    input, which could result in denial of service through resource
    exhaustion.

CVE-2012-5634

    Incorrect interrupt handling when using VT-d hardware could result
    in denial of service.

CVE-2013-0153

    Insufficient restriction of interrupt access could result in denial
    of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.7.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=870412#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-10-26 12:25:42 UTC  ``` The Xen PV domain builder contained no validation of the size of the supplied kernel or ramdisk either before or after decompression. This could cause the toolstack to consume all available RAM in the domain running the domain builder.  A malicious guest administrator who can supply a kernel or ramdisk can exhaust memory in domain 0 leading to a denial of service attack.  HVM guests are not affected by this vulnerability.  Reference: <http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2012-10/msg02015.html> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/10/26/3>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=870412#c2)  Petr Matousek    2012-10-26 12:28:55 UTC  ``` Created xen tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 870414](show_bug.cgi?id=870414 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4544 xen: Xen domain builder Out-of-memory due to malicious kernel/ramdisk [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=870412#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-07 18:54:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0241 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0241.html>   ``` |  |
