Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because the MyWebSearch CGI script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application's output. This is a classic XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a user's web browser.
- **Various malicious actions:** This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network by crafting malicious input.
- **User Interaction Required:** An attacker must entice a user to interact with the malicious input.  This is often done through a link or webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any special authentication and can be remote.
- **Crafted Input:**  The attacker must be able to craft malicious input that will be processed by the vulnerable CGI script. This input is typically embedded in a URL or a web form.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affects MyWebSearch versions 1.22 and earlier.
*   The JVN analysis indicates a "Medium" severity based on CVSS v2, but the JPCERT/CC analysis rates the access and authentication measures as "High" while user interaction is rated "Mid", and exploit complexity as "High".
*   The vendor, Final Beta Lab, provides a link to the MyWebSearch page (in Japanese) for updates.
