Title: Xen Security Advisory 24 (CVE-2012-4539) - Grant table hypercall infinite loop DoS vulnerability

Vulnerability: Grant table hypercall infinite loop DoS

Root Cause: Inappropriate duplicate use of the same loop control variable when passing bad arguments to GNTTABOP_get_status_frames. This can cause an infinite loop in the compat hypercall handler.

Affected Systems: Xen versions 4.0 and onwards. Only 32-bit x86 PV guests running on 64-bit Xen hypervisors are vulnerable.

Impact: A malicious guest administrator can trigger the bug, leading to a system crash if the Xen watchdog is enabled, or complete unresponsiveness if it's disabled.

Attack Vector: A malicious guest administrator can trigger the vulnerability by passing bad arguments to the GNTTABOP_get_status_frames hypercall.

Mitigation: Running only 64-bit guests, or running a 32-bit hypervisor (which supports only 32-bit guests), will avoid this vulnerability. Running only HVM guests will also avoid the vulnerability.
