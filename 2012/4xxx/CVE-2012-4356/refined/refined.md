    {
      "root_cause": "The application uses a static buffer of 0x119 bytes to handle incoming data on TCP port 46824. Lack of proper input validation and size checks in various functions leads to multiple vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Code execution through vulnerable function calls (DbiGetRecordCount, @Db@TDataSet@Close$qqrv, DbiSetToRecordNo) by controlling function pointers.",
        "Stack overflow in _TCPIPS_BinOpenFileFP due to insufficient buffer size when using sprintf.",
        "Directory traversal vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization when opening files using opcode 0x78.",
        "Arbitrary memory write (write4) by manipulating file operation opcodes and array elements, leading to potential use of arbitrary values with EnterCriticalSection.",
        "Arbitrary byte write (write1) due to lack of checks on return value of realloc, allowing to write a 0x00 byte outside the existing buffer."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution, arbitrary file reading, and arbitrary memory writes. This allows an attacker to fully compromise the system running the vulnerable application.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending specially crafted TCP packets to the vulnerable server listening on port 46824.",

        "root_cause": "Signed comparison introduced in version 2.07.17 allows bypassing of a previous fix by using negative values. Specifically, `if((signed int)value > 32) return;` can be bypassed by sending a negative value, and not just any value above 32.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The use of a signed integer comparison instead of unsigned allows for negative values to be processed, which bypasses the intended size check and re-enables the old vulnerabilities."
