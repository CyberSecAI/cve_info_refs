This sounds like a single issue with two possible outcomes?

The module doesn't sufficiently validate css import statements to
confirm they only include css content appropriate to show to end
users. This could allow a malicious user to add sensitive content from
the site (e.g. settings.php) exposing that sensitive content to
visitors of the page. It could also be used to execute a Cross Site
Scripting attack.

Links to the code commits fixing this would be helpful.

This is a multiple CVE issue?

The description/vulns don't seem to match up on this one. Can you clarify?

The module does not protect its menu paths, which contain sensitive
information about all javascript files on the site and their contents.
The module does not validate filenames which can lead to potential
read/write access to arbitrary files on the server.

Links to the code commits fixing this would be helpful.

So this is the same root issue, not filtering file uploads allowing an
attacker to upload arbitrary stuff (including PHP code), the outcome
of which could be PHP code execution, or XSS (or other things I
suppose like DoS, CSRF, etc.)?

# Drupal Custom Publishing Options XSS Vulnerability

[disclosure](/tag/disclosure) [drupal](/tag/drupal)
30 May 2012
#### Vulnerability Report

Reported Jan 3, 2012

CVE: [CVE-2012-4496](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4496)

#### Description of Vulnerability:

Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS) written in PHP and MySQL. The Drupal Custom Publishing Options module (https://drupal.org/project/custom\_pub) contains a persistent cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the fact that it fails to sanitize format names before display.

#### Systems affected:

Drupal 6.22 with Custom Publishing Options 6.x-1.4 was tested and shown to be vulnerable

#### Impact

User could inject arbitrary scripts into pages affecting site users. This could result in administrative account compromise leading to web server process compromise.

#### Mitigating factors:

In order to execute arbitrary script injection malicious users must have 'Administer nodes' permission.

#### Proof of Concept Exploit:

1. Install and enable the Custom Publishing Options module
2. Add a new label at ?q=admin/content/custom\_pub inserting arbitrary HTML in the 'Publishing label' field.
3. Save the label to view the rendered script or view it on the create content page for the appropriate content type.

#### Vendor Response

After the vulnerability was publicly disclosed at this site on 30 May, 2012 (http://www.madirish.net/538) and the vendor was notified of the disclosure, work commenced that resulted in SA-CONTRIB-2012-127 on 15 August 2012 recommending upgrading to versions 6.x-1.4 or later.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
