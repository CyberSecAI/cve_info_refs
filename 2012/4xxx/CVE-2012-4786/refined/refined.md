Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-4786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the way Windows handles specially crafted TrueType Font (TTF) files. Specifically, the Windows kernel-mode driver does not properly handle objects in memory when parsing these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of TTF files:** The core weakness lies in the insufficient validation or handling of malformed data within TrueType font files by the Windows kernel-mode driver. This can lead to memory corruption or other exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, gaining full control over the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing a webpage with embedded specially crafted TrueType font files. Users who visit the site could be exploited.
*   **File Sharing Attacks:** An attacker can distribute a specially crafted document (e.g., via email or shared network folders) containing the malicious font files. Users who open the document are vulnerable.
*   **Local Attacks:** A local attacker can run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access (Web and File-sharing):** For web-based and file-sharing scenarios, the attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication. They need to convince a user to either visit a malicious website or open a malicious document.
*   **Local, Authenticated Access (Local Attack):** For a local attack, the attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on to the system locally.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary mitigation is to apply the security update released by Microsoft, specifically KB2753842 and KB2779030.
*   **Disable WebClient Service:** Disabling the WebClient service can block the most likely remote attack vector via the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service.
*   **Block TCP ports 139 and 445:** Blocking these ports at the firewall helps protect systems from network-based attacks.
*  **Disable Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**: This prevents the malicious TrueType fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer, potentially reducing the attack surface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Microsoft Windows including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT.
* The security update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows kernel-mode drivers handle objects in memory when parsing TrueType font files.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any public exploitation of this vulnerability at the time the security bulletin was released.
