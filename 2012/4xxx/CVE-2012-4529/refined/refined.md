Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4529:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.encodeURL()` method in JBoss Web incorrectly appends the `jsessionid` as a query string parameter to the URL, even when the session tracking method is set to 'COOKIE' only. This occurs during the processing of the first request of a session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Session ID Exposure**: The `jsessionid` is exposed in the URL, which is not expected when cookies are the only method for session tracking.
-   **Unintended Behavior**: The `encodeURL()` method's behavior is inconsistent with the configured session tracking method (COOKIE only).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Session Hijacking**: An attacker could potentially obtain a user's `jsessionid` through a man-in-the-middle attack or by extracting it from log files. This could allow the attacker to hijack the user's session.
-   **Information Leakage**: Session IDs are inadvertently leaked where they may not be anticipated, such as in logs or through network monitoring, providing attackers an attack vector.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) Attack**: An attacker can intercept network traffic between the user and the server to capture the `jsessionid` included in the URL.
-   **Log File Extraction**: An attacker might gain access to log files containing the URLs with exposed `jsessionid` values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access**: For MitM attacks, the attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network communication.
-   **Access to Logs:** To extract `jsessionid` values from logs, the attacker would need access to the server's or application's logs.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability specifically affects JBoss Web and not Apache Tomcat.
-   This is because the relevant servlet feature is part of Servlet 3.0 specification, which is not supported in Tomcat 5 and 6. Tomcat 7 is not vulnerable.
-   The issue was addressed in JBoss Web version 7.2.x.
-   Mitigation measures suggested:
    -   Using SSL encryption to prevent MitM attacks.
    -   Using URL rewriting techniques, such as filters or rewrite valves.
