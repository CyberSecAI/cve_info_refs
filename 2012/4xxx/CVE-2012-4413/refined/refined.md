Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from OpenStack Keystone not properly updating or invalidating existing tokens when user roles are changed (granted or revoked).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Authorization:** When a user's roles were modified (either granted or revoked), existing authentication tokens for that user were not updated to reflect these changes.
*   **Token Persistence:** These tokens would remain valid with their original set of roles until their natural expiration or explicit invalidation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker, after having their access revoked, could continue using existing valid tokens to access resources that they should no longer have access to.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If a user had a role granted to them and then revoked, they could continue to use an older token with the granted roles to access privileged resources they shouldn't have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Role Change Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by having their roles changed (revoked) and then continuing to use an existing, valid token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Existing Token:** The attacker must have a valid token issued before the role change.
*   **Knowledge of Role Changes:** The attacker would likely need some way to know their roles were changed.
*   **Access to System:** The attacker needs to be able to access the resources in the OpenStack environment to be able to use an existing valid token.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The fix involves invalidating all tokens held by a user upon role grant or revoke.
*   Patches were issued for both Essex and Folsom versions of OpenStack Keystone.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Dolph Mathews of Rackspace.
*   Ubuntu provided an update for keystone and python-keystone packages to address the issue.
