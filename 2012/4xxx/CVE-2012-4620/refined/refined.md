The content relates to CVE-2012-4620.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A queue wedge vulnerability exists in Cisco IOS Software when processing certain tunneled IP packets. Specifically, when a router receives GRE/IP, IPIP, or IPv6 in IPv4 tunneled packets destined for the router, a processing error occurs, and these packets are not dequeued from the interface input queue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a type of "queue wedge" where packets are added to an interface queue but never removed due to a processing error. This leads to a blocked interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service condition. The affected interfaces become unable to pass traffic as the input queue becomes full, and no new packets can be processed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the network. Attackers send specific types of tunneled IP packets (GRE/IP, IPIP, or IPv6 in IPv4) to the vulnerable router, with the tunnel terminating at the router itself (transit traffic is not a factor).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to send crafted, tunneled IP packets to a vulnerable Cisco IOS router on a network. No specific privileges are mentioned as required, and the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
