Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-4196:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Mozilla Firefox handled the `Location` object. It was possible to use property injection by prototype to bypass security wrapper protections on the `Location` object, leading to cross-origin data access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate security checks on the `Location` object.
- Ability to bypass security wrapper protections using prototype manipulation.
- Allowing cross-origin access to the `Location` object which should be restricted by the same-origin policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-origin information disclosure:** A remote attacker could bypass security protections and perform cross-origin reading of the `Location` object, potentially exposing sensitive information like session IDs and OAuth tokens.
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Though not the primary vulnerability, the flaw was related to other XSS issues, which could be exploited if combined with the `Location` object manipulation.
    
**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a specially crafted web page.
- By using a malicious Javascript, the attacker manipulates the `Location` object's prototype, bypassing the security protections and gaining access to cross-origin `Location` object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious HTML page with JavaScript code to exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to trick a user into opening the malicious page (e.g., through phishing or a compromised website).

**Additional Technical Details**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that even when the Location object is protected, attackers can use Javascript to bypass the protections using prototype injection.
-  The fix involved adding a direct principal check in `nsLocation.cpp`, and improving the existing tests to cover more edge cases. The fixes ensure that the object's true location cannot be bypassed, even if a method is pulled off a same-origin object and applied to a cross-origin one.
- Mozilla's bug report also indicates a deeper issue of a lack of a dynamic security check and that the location object's security scope should be linked to their window object.
