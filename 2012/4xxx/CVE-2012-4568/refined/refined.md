Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-4568:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in LetoDMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection mechanisms. This means that an attacker can potentially craft malicious requests that, when executed by an authenticated user, can lead to unintended actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that an attacker could potentially perform actions within the LetoDMS application on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent or knowledge. These actions could include modifying data, deleting information, or any other action the user is authorized to perform.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted malicious web requests that are sent to the user. The user, if logged into the application, will unknowingly execute the request if the CSRF protection is missing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious request and then trick a logged-in LetoDMS user into executing it. This can be done via email, web pages, or other means. The attacker needs no specific position or privileges within the LetoDMS application itself.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content indicates multiple instances of missing CSRF protection across different parts of the application
- The fixes were introduced in LetoDMS version 3.3.8
- The content references specific SVN revisions that address this issue.
