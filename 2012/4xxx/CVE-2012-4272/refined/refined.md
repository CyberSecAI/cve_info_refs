The provided content relates to CVE-2012-4272.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied URLs within the "2 Click Social Media Buttons" WordPress plugin, specifically affecting the Xing and Pinterest share button functionalities. The plugin failed to sanitize the `xing-url` and `pinterest-url` parameters passed via the `$_REQUEST` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin directly outputs the unsanitized URL parameters into the HTML attributes of the social sharing buttons, specifically within the `data-url` attribute for Xing and `href` for Pinterest. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into these URLs, leading to XSS.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of input sanitization for the `$_REQUEST` parameters  `xing-url` and `pinterest-url` before they are used to generate the share button code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the webpage when a user clicks the Xing or Pinterest share buttons. This could result in:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Cookie stealing.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to craft a URL with malicious javascript in the `xing-url` or `pinterest-url` parameters.
- The attacker could then trick a user into clicking a link with the crafted URL.
- When a page renders using the plugin and the crafted URL is used for the social buttons, the payload will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL parameters that are used by the plugin.
- No specific user privileges are required on the victim's WordPress instance.

**Additional details:**
- The fix includes using `strip_tags()` to remove HTML tags from the URL, preventing the execution of injected JavaScript code. For the permalink, `esc_url()` was used.
- The changeset message indicates "Sicherheitsl√ºcke bei Xing und Pinterest behoben" which translates to "Security vulnerability fixed for Xing and Pinterest".
