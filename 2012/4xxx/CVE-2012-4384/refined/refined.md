Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this CVE is the presence of multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the letodms application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** Vulnerability exists within the login page of the application.
- **Stored XSS:** Vulnerabilities are located in:
    - Document Owner/User name fields.
    - Calendar functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Inject malicious scripts into the application.
- Steal sensitive user information.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Potentially perform actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vectors are network based, meaning that an attacker would leverage the network to reach the affected system.
- **Reflected XSS:** Attackers would craft malicious URLs or forms that contain malicious javascript code.
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker would inject malicious scripts which is stored in the database and displayed to other users when viewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the application containing malicious script.
- For stored XSS, the attacker needs the capability to inject malicious code into the affected fields.
- No specific level of privilege is required to exploit these vulnerabilities. User interaction is required (e.g., clicking a malicious link, viewing a malicious stored entry) to trigger the vulnerability.
