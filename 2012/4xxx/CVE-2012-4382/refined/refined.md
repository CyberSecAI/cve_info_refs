Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of user block metadata within MediaWiki. Specifically, when a user is blocked with the "Hide username from edits and lists" option enabled, the block reason should also be hidden from administrators who don't possess the necessary 'hideuser' right. However, due to a flaw, the block reason becomes visible to other administrators when they attempt to re-block the same user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of potentially sensitive block reasons to unauthorized administrators.
-   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system fails to properly enforce access controls, leading to the unintended exposure of hidden data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privacy Breach:**  Administrators without the appropriate permissions can view the block reasons, potentially revealing private information that was intended to be suppressed. This can include personal details or sensitive information that was meant to be hidden from regular administrators.
-   **Compromised Confidentiality:** This breach of confidentiality can have serious implications for user privacy, especially if block reasons contain sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Re-blocking:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator attempts to re-block a user who was previously blocked with the "Hide username from edits and lists" option.
-  **Accessing Block Log:** An administrator can view a block reason if they navigate to the Special:Block page and attempt to reblock a user who was blocked with the "Hide username from edits and lists" option selected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to be an administrator on the MediaWiki instance.
-   **Knowledge of Blocked User:** The attacker needs to be aware of a user who has been blocked with the "Hide username from edits and lists" option enabled.
