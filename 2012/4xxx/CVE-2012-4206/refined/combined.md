Attached file
[trojan DLL loads cmd.exe](attachment.cgi?id=662213)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=662213&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0.1
Build ID: 20120905151427
Steps to reproduce:
I downloaded the current Firefox installer in the Windows downloads directory.
C:\Users\User\Downloads
Then I put a trojan dwmapi.dll in the same directory.
Actual results:
If a user wants to install the Firefox browser, the setup loads the trojan dll with administrative privileges.
As described here <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/134> , you can compromise the victim with a social engineering attack like this.
Expected results:
The installer should not load the trojan dll.

correction:
If a user wants to install the Firefox browser, the setup loads the trojan dll with administrative privileges when the installer is executed as administrator.
If the user executes the installer with normal privileges the DLL will be loaded without administrative privileges.
Sorry!

Appears to affect the 7-Zip self-extracting stub and not NSIS itself.

I also didn't see this dll listed when using depends.exe on the installer file. With this info I think the sec-critical should be downgraded.

I see it under COMCTL32.DLL for the installer though it doesn't load it.

Ya, I was looking in the "Module List View" which displays a list of all unique modules that are dependencies for the root module you opened.
I guess since dwmapi.dll is delay load, it doesn't show up in the unique list?

OK after looking at this more:
1) You can reproduce that it launches high integrity cmd processes by right clicking and running as administrator
2) If you just double click and let NSIS do the UAC elevation though, you cannot reproduce. In this case cmd.exe is started, but they are started at medium integrity and if the user has access to the downloads directory, they are already running as that.

In fact I seen [Comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer") but I thought the comment meant you press no to the UAC prompt, and in which case limited user accounts install into app data.

@Brian What do you think?
Is it a critical vulnerability?
You can gain administrative privileges if the user starts the installer with a right click.
If the user doesn't click right, you can execute a DLL with user privileges.
Isn't this enough to compromise the victim?
For example you can get a meterpreter reverse shell with powershell.exe "Shellcode".
I think this is a critical vulnerability.

Brian wasn't giving an opinion as to whether this is a critical vulnerability. Brian and I were trying to determine the behavior when launching the installer via the 7-Zip self-extractor and when launching the actual NSIS installer without the 7-Zip self-extractor.

Yup re: [Comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer").
So to summarize:
- I think manually loading this dll in init from an explicit path would fix
- If you use our main installer, and simply double click to run it, and a UAC prompt comes up, then I think this is not a security issue, because the cmd.exe processes that are started are medium integrity.
- If you use our main installer, and right click to run as admin, then I think this is a security flaw since an attacker can go from medium integrity access to high integrity access.

Why are we not using SetDllDirectory("") in the installer/self-extractor/everywhere we can? I know we've had problems in the main Firefox due to plugin breakage but our contained install-related programs should all do this!

I think that's a good idea but I don't think SetDllDirectory("") would help for this class of problems. Even after you call SetDllDirectory(""), the first place it'll search is the current module's directory. The second place is the current working directory which that call removes.

This affects the 7-Zip self-extractor which Firefox has been using since it was in the womb and we are not using SetDllDirectory because it is a 3rd party tool that we did not write or know about this issue until recently! Agreed that all programs should do this! :)

I think a good first step would be to check if the latest 7-Zip self-extractor still has this issue especially since we would want to upstream any fix we come up with.

Forgot to mention that Brian, myself, and the platform integration team is rather busy with project / feature work so we'd need to get Firefox product management on board with dropping that work if any of us are to work on this immediately.

Is this a sec-high or sec-critical?

It would take some social engineering to get someone to download dwmapi.dll into their download directory and not say "WTF is this?" and cancel the download attempt. But... once you do the user is eventually in trouble. I can't justify sec-critical because this is not a drive-by type bug. I'm tempted to lower to sec-moderate on the user interaction involved, but the results are bad enough to call it sec-high.Keywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---) → [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

Sorry about the canceled reviews, I had this working first from my own src for 7zip so I just removed the old code in other-licenses and included the new one. Then when I was posting patches I noticed it was 4MB which is too big to even attach to bugzilla let alone add to the tree :)
So I just applied the fix to the src that was already in the other-licenses folder, and rebuilt the SFX with that src with the ReleaseD config.

Interesting bit of info from the comments section of SetDllDirectory:
[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686203%28v=vs.85%29.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686203%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)
> When you launch a child process and Windows searches for its implicitly-linked
> DLL dependencies, whether or not the current directory is searched depends on
> whether or not your process (i.e. the parent of the one just launched) has called
> SetDllDirectory("").
So the reason why SetDllDirectory("") doesn't work as I mentioned in [Comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer"), is not because of SetDllDirectory removes the CWD (the CWD is not in the search path at all). But the reason is because it only matters if the parent called SetDllDirectory or not. In our case explorer.exe didn't call it.
I tested without the extra "loadDlls" code, with only the SetDllDirectory("") and the bug still reproduces by the way.
Please proceed with the reviews when you get a chance, the only thing I'll do before landing (other than review comments) is update the comments in the code to indicate this.

And the above applies not to LoadLibrary but to implicitly linked and delayed loaded implicitly linked dlls.
In the case of dwmapi.dll, it is implicitly linked and a delayed loaded dll.

OK, I'm actually going to move the NSIS part of this patch into it's own non security sensitive bug. It is not a fix to this bug and it is just a precaution. I'll do it for those extra 3 nsi as well in that bug. I'll obsolete that patch which is r- in this bug now.
> Did you verify this fixes the problem for this bug?
Yes, I verified 2 things:
1) The patch as is (Patch v1 - Actual Fix - 7zip changes for DLL preload) fixes the problem.
2) That same patch modified to only call SetDllDirectory("") can still reproduce the problem. The reason being that the call to SetDllDirectory("") does not help with delay loaded DLLs, the only way I've ever found to fix this is to load it before the delayed load happens from an absolute path. See [Comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer") for further explanation.
> Is this fixed in the latest 7-Zip source?
I tried with the most recent stable version, and no it is not fixed there.
I can try to send in a patch for that once this lands.

The new sfx is 126,464 bytes

If a default Win XP SP1 meets all of the dependencies then there is no need to.

That would be fine. I found it was easier to just use reshacker to change these values which change more often than the code especially when compiling with VC 6.

Same as before but did these steps:
1. Renamed to .dll
2. Opened with VS resource editor
3. Modified manifest and saved it
4. Renamed back to .sfx

doh, tried a try build and getting: MSVCR90.dll is missing from your computer.
So I either have to statically link to the C runtime which will probably increase the installer size even further, or install VC6 and build that way. I'll try to find VC6 and build that way. I seem to need it every now and again anyway.

Patc v2 - New self extracting file (SFX)
I'll carry forward this r+ once I build with VC6, I'll re-update the manifest at that time as well.

I found my old MSDN VC6 but the 7zipstub project doesn't compile cleanly. I even tried with VC6SP6. I suspect the last SFX build wasn't done with VC6. For example, there are 151 errors including MEM\_LARGE\_PAGES not being defined. I checked the headers and there is no conditional inclusion on a WINVER, it just doesn't exist. I'll try with VC2010 and statically link to the runtime.

ok so more info...
Statically linking results in a 2MB file, so that's not acceptable.
I did find out though that the problem is with the modified manifest.
Apparently you can't safely change a manifest file.
I tried with both Visual Studio and reshacker with the same results.
I'm going to have to compile those OS strings in directly from source.

OK this bug was a bit of a nightmare but I think I have it working correctly now and it will embed the manifest for any future changes we have to make.
I even exported the manifest from the old sfx, and it gives me that dll error.
So I just used the manifest I had, and added a supportedOS block to it.
Maybe the manifest gets changed at the time of embedding so importing directly doesn't work.

As discussed, we're going to use VC6 to compile to keep the file size low and not have any missing CRT errors on startup.
If this is r+ed could you compile that SFX to avoid me having to setup the WinVista SDK with VC6?

The manifest and resource string looks correct, I'll push to try for builds only and try on a couple of VMs I have.
I'll update my patch to have "Setup Error" to match the updated string.

[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
User impact if declined: Escalation of privileges attack. A lower integrity process can become a high integrity process by placing a dll with arbitrary code by the given name in the downloads folder and waiting for Firefox to be executed.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): I tested with a try build
Fix Landed on Version: m-c v19
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low
String or UUID changes made by this patch: There is a minimum version required error inside the 7zip stub which cannot be localized at this time. Jonath and Asa are OK with this given that the only time it can be showed is on unsupported OS.
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.

This has regressed the installer for ESR10 builds. We can no longer run ESR10 on Windows 2000 because "Windows XP SP2 or newer is required". I don't believe we wanted to desupport Windows 2000 for ESR10 until we desupported ESR10.

There's no reason the ESR patch has to fail < WinXP SP2, instead of putting on the MessageBox and bailing out just keep going... People can still install ESR on those old OS's, they just won't get this security fix. Much better than having the ESR installer insecure on ALL versions of Windows, especially since most of our users will be on systems that can benefit from this patch.
Putting this back on the ESR-10 radar.

How much of a priority is this for ESR10? Our installer has always been like this.
I think ESR17 is going to be released on November 20th and I think that would automatically include this fix.
I don't currently have an environment setup to build with VC6 with the Vista SDK and it would take a non trivial amount of time to set that up to make these changes. rstrong is away next week as well.

Brian: What OS did you use trying to reproduce this? Maybe this is Win7 (or even 8?) specific (also: 32-bit vs. 64-bit maybe?). I've found out about cryptbase.dll by looking at the Process Monitor log when launching the installer. I've also observed that the installer tries to load bcryptPrimitives.dll from the same folder as the installer, but renaming the POC to that name did not launch any cmd.exe processes.

I used Windows 8 32-bit to test this, maybe loading that DLL works differently there. Also see <http://www.pretentiousname.com/misc/W7E_Source/win7_uac_poc_details.html> on this, there someone used the cryptbase.dll trick to inject some UAC whitelist code into a Windows system program to elevate other programs.

So using both procmon and depends.exe here's an analysis of the loaded DLLs.
I can't reproduce the problem with any of the DLLs.
I think that any DLL not in the KnownDLLs list puts us at risk of such an attack.
If a DLL is delay loaded, then it is fixable by manually loading the DLL from the system32 directory at startup time before the actual function call is made. (That is the fix in this bug). Also I think that delay loaded DLLs are only a concern if a function is actually called on them.
Dlls that are loaded from procmon that are not in the KnownDLLs list and that are delay loaded:
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\uxtheme.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\apphelp.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cryptbase.dll
Dlls that are loaded from procmon that are not in the KnownDLLs list and that I don't see in depends.exe:
C:\Windows\System32\wow64.dll
C:\Windows\System32\wow64win.dll
C:\Windows\System32\wow64cpu.dll
Dlls that are loaded from procmon that are not in the KnownDLLs list but that are Implicit Dependencies [1]:
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\sspicli.dll
C:\Windows\winsxs\x86\_microsoft.windows.common-controls\_6595b64144ccf1df\_6.0.7601.17514\_none\_41e6975e2bd6f2b2\comctl32.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\KernelBase.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ntdll.dll
Dlls that are loaded from procmon and are not in the KnownDLLs but that we already fixed:
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\dwmapi.dll
Dlls that are loaded from procmon that are in the KnownDLLs list:
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\kernel32.dll
C:\Windows\System32\user32.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msvcrt.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\gdi32.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\sechost.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\rpcrt4.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\lpk.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\usp10.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\shlwapi.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\oleaut32.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ole32.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\shell32.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\imm32.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msctf.dll
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\advapi32.dll
It's not clear to me why some DLLs that are not in the KnownDLLs list are loaded from system32 even know there exists a file in the current module directory by the same name.
[1]: Implicit Dependencies
Implicit Dependency (also known as a load-time dependency or sometimes incorrectly referred to as static dependency): Module A is implicitly linked with a LIB file for Module B at compile/link time, and Module A's source code actually calls one or more functions in Module B. Module B is a load time dependency of Module A and will be loaded into memory regardless if Module A actually makes a call to Module B at run-time. Module B will be listed in Module A's import table.
[2]: Delay-load Dependency
Module A is delay-load linked with a LIB file for Module B at compile/link time, and Module A's source code actually calls one or more functions in Module B. Module B is a dynamic dependency and will only be loaded if Module A actually makes a call to Module B at run-time. Module B will be listed in Module A's delay-load import table.

Brian: I suspect the cryptbase.dll thing is a 32 vs. 64 bit issue. But I'll check in VMWare later (I only have the 32 bit version of Windows 8 in VMWare, currently downloading the 64 bit one).

I also tried to reproduce with Windows 8 (x64 Windows again) but I cannot reproduce.
Perhaps this is a system hook dependency where some other software, like maybe an anti-virus package injects a dll.
System Hook Dependency (also known as an injected dependency): This type of dependency occurs when another application hooks a specific event (like a mouse event) in a process. When that process produces that event, the OS can inject a module into the process to handle the event. The module that is injected into the process is not really a dependent of any other module, but does resides in that process' address space.

I cannot reproduce on Win8x64, nor Vistax86, nor Win7x64.
I also tried on each OS with the other 2 DLLs that are not in the KnownDLLs list and are delay loaded, (uxtheme.dll, apphelp.dll) but cannot reproduce with those.

It would be good for someone to go through the process like I did in [Comment 103](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c103 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer") on each of these OS and check for similar problems. I don't have the time nor setup myself to verify all of the following. Since this is an escalation of privileges attack we only need to check on Vista and up:
- Vista x86
- Vista x64
- Windows 7 x86
- Windows 7 x64
- Windows 8 x86
- Windows 8 x64
Also cryptbase.dll problem only shows up on Win8x86 and possibly win7x86 out of the 6 mentioned above, so this shows that problems like this can be per OS or per architecture.

I'll need some time to coordinate this which I'll try to do via email or IRC. I think we should be flipping the status flags until it's really fixed.

More info on testing:
I'd only test with the latest Nightly.
And I'd use these OS:
- Vista x86
- Vista x64
- Windows 7 x86
- Windows 7 x64
- Windows 8 x86
- Windows 8 x64
1. Rename the installer to something unique like firefoxinstaller.exe
2. Run procmon
3. Add a filter to procmon for process name is firefoxinstaller.exe
4. Add a filter for Path contains .dll
5. Add a filter for Operation is Load Image
6. Press OK
7. Run the installer to completion.
8. Copy out all of the output from procmon by selecting all of it and Ctrl+C, paste it in notepad or gvim
9. Close procmon
9. Filter out the list of all unique dlls. Start at the first dll and do a ctrl+f to find if there's any dupes, remove the dupes. Go to the next line.
10. Determine from this list which ones are listed here:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs
Make sure to use the same registry location as the OS the test is running on. This list may differ per OS.
11. Filter down your list to only the Dlls that are not in the KnownDLLs list. Anything that is in the registry in the KnownDLLs list can be ignored.
12. Download the latest nightly installer in a new folder
13. Download the POC dll and put it in that same folder,
14. Download process explorer and DO NOT put it inside that folder, the Poc dll is inside the zip attached to this bug. Make sure you extract first.
13. For each DLL in the list in #11 above, Copy the PoC DLL and rename it to match the DLL name. Example: cryptbase.dll
14. Right click on the Process Explorer tool and run as administrator
15. Go to View Select Columns: Turn on Integrity Level
16. Sort by process name by clicking on that heading
17. close any cmd.exe processes you already have open
18. Right click on the installer and run as administrator, if any cmd.exe show up running as high integrity at all then you reproduced a DLL injection.
If you find a dll that starts a bunch of cmd.exe processes as mentioned in #18 above:
1. Open firefoxinstaller.exe in depends.exe (Dependency Walker tool)
2. In the module list view, find the dll in the list box (not the tree). See if it has an icon next to the DLL of an hourglass.
If it does that means it is a delayed loaded DLL and can easily be fixed.
I'd suggest testing with Win8x86 first and if you did the steps correctly you should find cryptbase.dll as a Dll injection.

You can save a bit of time when using the WinObj tool from <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896657.aspx> in Step 10 instead. It displays all known Windows system DLLs (Windows loads statically linked DLLs into the KnownDLLs list, too, so that's the transitive closure of the registry list). You need to use the dll list from the KnownDlls32 section, at least when testing the normal 32-bit version of Firefox.

Thanks for the help so far Brian and Frank. I'd like to seek approval for me to use Softvision (our Romanian QA partner) to load-balance this testing. There's a lot to do here and if the end-result is time sensitive we need to try to parallelize the testing. My initial estimate is that I'd get this done in a couple of weeks on my own.

To speed the test a bit up ;): I would export the log file in Step 8 with File->Save... as Comma-Separated Value file and save it somewhere. Then open that CSV file in Microsoft Office (use comma as separator) and use the "Remove Duplicates" function in the Data header to get all unique values in the Path column.

I just started this testing and will try to bang it out a bit each day as I find free time.
I've only tested the win32 normal installer on Windows 8 64-bit so far and found SHCore.dll to be spawning cmd.exe high integrity processes with the POC dll.

Confirmed SHCore.dll on win8x64. This isn't a delay loaded DLL so the previous fixes won't work. I think the only way to fix it is to turn it into a delay loaded DLL and then apply the same fix.

Hrm given [Comment 124](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c124 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer") I tried to delay load shcore.dll from VC6 on win2k and from vc2010 on win7 but I get this error.

Should I be providing patches and landing as QA finds new DLLs here? I think that would be best but let me know if I should just wait since you are the one that has to build the VC6 SFX files.
SHCore.dll wasn't showing as a delay loaded DLL in the module list view, but it did show up as a delay loaded library in the tree view. And from testing, it is indeed a delay loaded module.

I was under the impression that compiling with VC6 wouldn't delay load shcore.dll due to [comment #127](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c127 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer"). Is that impression incorrect?

The option is ignored yes, but it's already delay loaded though. I just thought it wasn't at first. Usually the delay loaded icon shows up on both the module list on the bottom of depends.exe and the top tree. This time it only showed up on the top tree. It is delay loaded though.

akeybl is asking that this ESR10 bug be nominated/landed before Wednesday 11/14. I don't think we'll have this fully tested by then, but we'll try to land whatever is identified by that date. That may or may not be everything depending on if QA finds more after that date. The bug will be resolved/fixed once QA finishes the tests and the patches land.
Anthony is currently actively coordinating testing to get this done as soon as possible.

Not clear to me, so is that an a+ for the esr10 patch? It's a different patch than the aurora patch by the way.

Too late now, but a note for the future: reopening a FIXED bug is bad form, particularly for one that's had patches landed on branches. Tracking multiple landings in a single bug results in very confusing bug history, and introduces plenty of potential for confusion. In these cases you should always track the newly discovered problem in a new bug (even if the original landed fix was entirely insufficient).

Brian, what do you think about copying the file into a temp directory to deal with this? Might have to perform a disk space check first though.

Possibly for the stub installer, I'm going to break that out into a different bug since it will likely be a different fix and should be tracked differently.

Why not for the 7-zip self-extractor? Seems like it would be fairly simple to get around most of this that way.

So my only concern with copying it to a temp directory is that a low integrity process could use ReadDirectoryChangesW or similar and wait for new files by whatever name we copy as is added. Then it could copy DLLs before the process is actually executed but after the copy happens. This process could then get execute itself as a high integrity process through the DLL.
It's unlikely that someone will do that but by using a similar fix to what we already did we have a fool proof method.
We may want to do that in addition to the above fix though in case new DLL dependencies get added in over time.
If we copy to a directory that only high integrity processes have access to that would probably work. I think we can do that in a spin off of this bug though. We also may have to move the UAC elevate call up into the 7zip stub.

The 7-zip self-extractor doesn't run elevated unless it is executed as elevated so how would the new process run elevated? It would be possible through the NSIS exe in the stated scenario when it requests elevation.
My curiosity about possible other methods is mainly due to the large number of dll's and that we will need to check for additional dll's whenever a new Windows is released (possibly SP as well though less likely)... lots of whack-a-mole.
Moving the UAC elevate call to the stub would be a PITA. It would require moving the call to launch the application to the stub as well since we need to be in the user process, the ability to require elevation in the stub for people that are a member of the admin group and the request to elevate for those that are not... among other things.

This whole bug is about right clicking on the installer and running as admin. The DLLs that I've fixed so far do not reproduce a problem if you simply double click the installer. So the 7zip self-extractor does run elevated in that case.

Ya I think it is a good idea and will lessen the possibility of an attack, but for the reasons mentioned above, I don't think it is 100% foolproof. I do think it should be implemented for both installers but possibly as part of another bug.
I agree moving the UAC call up would be a PITA. I'm fine with just copying to a temp directory, but it is not 100% foolproof, so in addition we should add the DLLs to the preload list like the previous DLL fixes in this bug.
So moving forward I think we should:
- Fix SHCore.dll and uxtheme.dll for the main installer in this bug, and any others QA finds for that installer. This fix will be trivial and we can move it up to other branches safely.
- File a follow up to fix the stub, and in that bug we can also do the copy to temp to avoid future problems with major and minor updates to the OS and to our installer.
The whole thing is a PITA, you can't safely execute a binary as a high integrity process from a low integrity folder if it has DLL dependencies. Even the normal NSIS installer copies itself to temp and extracts DLLs to temp. So that's already susceptible to the same attack that I mentioned earlier with watching directory changes :(

OK... let's move forward as is with these fixes and consider the options for the full and the stub installer. Note that we \*might\* be able to get rid of the 7-Zip self-extractor and just use NSIS but we weren't able to get the same high level of compression out of NSIS as we were when using the 7-Zip self-extractor (we tuned the hell out of it) and it would likely cause headaches with l10n repackaging and partner builds though I can think of a couple of ways to work around them.

We have a problem for the stub installer by the way. The bad DLLs mentioned above are loaded before .onInit is called. Maybe a fix is to wrap the stub as a 7zip self extracting archive so we can execute it inside the 7zip Main. We can discuss it more in that bug when I post it soon.

Managed to power through a large chunk of the testing today (please see intra-wiki for details). The following is all that remains to be tested:
\* win32 normal installer on Windows 8 32-bit
\* win32 stub installer on Windows 8 32-bit
\* win64 stub installer on Windows 8 64-bit
Hopefully we can complete this by EOD-tomorrow.

I think it would be good to have the results in this bug for when this bug goes public. Ditto for the stub installer bug. Any format is fine though, whatever method is fastest to get the info here.

Is this actually the cryptbase shcore uxtheme SFX for esr or is it the shcore uxtheme SFX for mozilla-central (cryptbase already landed on mozilla-central)?

I didn't land the previous SFX patch since I knew this one was coming. Could I carry forward the a+ here?

Patch v1 - vc-6 patch file for new SFX containing dwmapi, cryptbase, shcore (new), and uxtheme (new) - For mozilla-central
[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: escalation of privs for installer. Low integrity process can copy a DLL into the downloads folder and wait for a user to execute firefox.
Fix Landed on Version: Just adds more DLLs to the previous fix
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Very low

I think we should keep this as "esr10: affected" unless the full fix to all DLLs gets promoted.

As Gavin recommended in [comment 140](/show_bug.cgi?id=792106#c140 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer") - I'd really suggest having separate bugs for any more patches. It is already getting confusing as to what has landed where and when, and what is pending, I'm only able to track it as I'm actively watching what is going through, and even then I suspect I'm at risk of not matching the changes properly.

There are no more patches being landed in this bug onto mozilla-central. But for the bugs that are already landed there, and that need to be uplifted to other channels, we should leave the tracking flags as affected and handle those already issued approval requests here.
That's part of the reason I moved out the stub installer DLLs into its own bug.

I believe this patch will also be needed on ESR 17, as 17 has shipped...

I think so since it's not fixed in v17.
How is the esr17 branch created by the way, is it a fresh clone of the v17 release? Or is it esr10 with v17's changesets pulled in?

Sorry, forgot the most important detail. None of the previously affected DLLs were able to be hijacked using the latest installers for these builds.

We assigned a CVE and wrote an advisory for this for Firefox 17 (mfsa2012-98). Reading this, it looks like this was an error and this never got fixed in Firefox 17?
It looks like [bug 809373](/show_bug.cgi?id=809373 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer") was opened, which is the same technique but using a different dll name. That bug was duped to this and this was re-opened.
Is that correct?
I have to figure out how to rewrite mfsa2012-98 to reflect this.

Initially 1 DLL was fixed here, then a new DLL with the same problem was discovered in [bug 809373](/show_bug.cgi?id=809373 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - DLL Hijacking - Firefox installer"), then that DLL and others were fixed inside this original bug. The original DLL was discovered by Robert Kugler, and later other DLLs were discovered by Frank Wein, Anthony Hughes, Kamil Jozwiak, myself, and Matt Wobensmith.

Thanks, Brian.
I'll figure out how to write it up. It would have been better, for me, to use a new bug for this but I know it was probably easier to keep the issue in one place given it is the same overall issue.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:1592-1
Rating: important
References: #790140
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 for VMware
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP2

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 10.0.11 ESR
security release, which fixes various bugs and security
issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-106: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series critically
rated of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and memory
corruption issues in shipped software. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
execution. We would also like to thank miaubiz for
reporting two additional use-after-free and memory
corruption issues introduced during Firefox development
that have been fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o use-after-free when loading html file on osx
(CVE-2012-5830) o Mesa crashes on certain texImage2D calls
involving level>0 (CVE-2012-5833) o integer overflow,
invalid write w/webgl bufferdata (CVE-2012-5835)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o crash in copyTexImage2D with image dimensions
too large for given level (CVE-2012-5838)
\*
MFSA 2012-105: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer
overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped
software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting five additional
use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow
flaws introduced during Firefox development that have been
fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditorState::PrepareEditor (CVE-2012-4214) o
Heap-use-after-free in
nsPlaintextEditor::FireClipboardEvent (CVE-2012-4215) o
Heap-use-after-free in gfxFont::GetFontEntry
(CVE-2012-4216) o Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWindow::OnExposeEvent (CVE-2012-5829) o
heap-buffer-overflow in
gfxShapedWord::CompressedGlyph::IsClusterStart o
CVE-2012-5839 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditorState::PrepareEditor (CVE-2012-5840)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o Heap-use-after-free in XPCWrappedNative::Mark
(CVE-2012-4212) o Heap-use-after-free in
nsEditor::FindNextLeafNode (CVE-2012-4213) o
Heap-use-after-free in nsViewManager::ProcessPendingUpdates
(CVE-2012-4217) o Heap-use-after-free
BuildTextRunsScanner::BreakSink::SetBreaks (CVE-2012-4218)
\*
MFSA 2012-104 / CVE-2012-4210: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a maliciously crafted
stylesheet is inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and
CSS can run in a chrome privileged context without being
properly sanitized first. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-103 / CVE-2012-4209: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a
frame whose name attribute's value is set to "top". This
can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-102 / CVE-2012-5837: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that when script is entered into
the Developer Toolbar, it runs in a chrome privileged
context. This allows for arbitrary code execution or
cross-site scripting (XSS) if a user can be convinced to
paste malicious code into the Developer Toolbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-101 / CVE-2012-4207: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa found when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is
used for text, the "~" character will destroy another
character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in
HZ-GB-2312.
\*
MFSA 2012-100 / CVE-2012-5841: Mozilla developer
Bobby Holley reported that security wrappers filter at the
time of property access, but once a function is returned,
the caller can use this function without further security
checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for
write actions on objects when only read actions should be
properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-99 / CVE-2012-4208: Mozilla developer Peter
Van der Beken discovered that same-origin XrayWrappers
expose chrome-only properties even when not in a chrome
compartment. This can allow web content to get properties
of DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-98 / CVE-2012-4206: Security researcher
Robert Kugler reported that when a specifically named DLL
file on a Windows computer is placed in the default
downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the Firefox
installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In
circumstances where the installer is run by an
administrator privileged account, this allows for the
downloaded DLL file to be run with administrator
privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution from
a privileged account.
\*
MFSA 2012-97 / CVE-2012-4205: Mozilla developer Gabor
Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created
within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the
sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running
untrusted code in a sandbox.
\*
MFSA 2012-96 / CVE-2012-4204: Security researcher
Scott Bell of Security-Assessment.com used the Address
Sanitizer tool to discover a memory corruption in
str\_unescape in the Javascript engine. This could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-95 / CVE-2012-4203: Security researcher
kakzz.ng@gmail.com reported that if a javascript: URL is
selected from the list of Firefox "new tab" page, the
script will inherit the privileges of the privileged "new
tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally
installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a
bookmark of a malicious javascript: URL.
\*
MFSA 2012-94 / CVE-2012-5836: Security researcher
Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining SVG text on a
path with the setting of CSS properties could lead to a
potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-93 / CVE-2012-4201: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that if code executed by
the evalInSandbox function sets location.href, it can get
the wrong subject principal for the URL check, ignoring the
sandbox's Javascript context and gaining the context of
evalInSandbox object. This can lead to malicious web
content being able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack or stealing a copy of a local file if the user has
installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-92 / CVE-2012-4202: Security researcher
Atte Kettunen from OUSPG used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format
images. This issue is potentially exploitable and could
lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-91: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-98

## Firefox installer DLL hijacking

Announced
November 20, 2012
Reporter
Robert Kugler
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 17
* Firefox 18
* Firefox ESR 10.0.11
* Firefox ESR 10.0.12
* Firefox ESR 17.0.1

### Description

Security researcher **Robert Kugler** reported that when a specifically named DLL file on a Windows computer is placed in the default downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the Firefox installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In circumstances where the installer is run by an administrator privileged account, this allows for the downloaded DLL file to be run with administrator privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution from a privileged account.

Additional vulnerable DLL file names were found and fixed in Firefox 18.0, Firefox ESR 17.0.1, and Firefox ESR 10.0.12 releases.
