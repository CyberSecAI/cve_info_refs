```
Root cause of vulnerability: Incorrect evaluation of Access Control Lists (ACLs) when virtual groups are involved.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Privilege escalation due to incorrect handling of virtual group names ("All", "Known", "Trusted") in ACL evaluations. This can result in users having more permissions than intended or lacking permissions they should have.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Privilege escalation: Attackers can gain unauthorized access or elevated privileges due to the misinterpretation of virtual group permissions.
  - Incorrect permissions: Users may have fewer permissions than required, leading to operational issues.

Attack vectors:
  - Exploitation occurs remotely via crafted server requests.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  -  An attacker needs to be a user of the MoinMoin system.
  - The attacker may need some knowledge of the system's ACL configuration to exploit the vulnerability fully.
