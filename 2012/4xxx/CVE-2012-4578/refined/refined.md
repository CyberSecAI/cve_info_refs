The content is related to CVE-2012-4578.

Vulnerability: Weak master key generation in geli(4) on FreeBSD 10 / -CURRENT.
Root cause: The geli(4) device may have a weak master key if the provider is created on a -CURRENT system built against source code between revisions r238116 and r239184.
Affected version: FreeBSD 10 / -CURRENT between revisions r238116 and r239184.
Impact: Potential compromise of encrypted data due to weak master key.
Attack vector: An attacker who can access the geli(4) device could potentially exploit the weak master key to decrypt the data.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Access to the geli(4) device.
Mitigation: Back up the data, overwrite the underlying provider with random data, upgrade the system, and recreate the provider.
Verification: Run `geli dump <provider> | grep version`. If the version is 7 and the system did not include the fix (r239184) when the provider was initialized, then the data is vulnerable.
