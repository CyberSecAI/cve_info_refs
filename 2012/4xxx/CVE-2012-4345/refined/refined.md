The provided content relates to CVE-2012-4345.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of table names and GIS data labels leading to the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The specific weakness is the lack of sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input, specifically table names and GIS data labels, before displaying them on various phpMyAdmin pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the phpMyAdmin interface, potentially allowing them to:
* Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
* Deface the phpMyAdmin interface.
* Redirect users to malicious websites.
* Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve using crafted table names or GIS data labels containing malicious JavaScript. The specific attack vectors include:
1.  Creating a new table with a crafted name (Database Structure page).
2.  Using "Empty" and "Drop" links of a crafted table (Database Structure page).
3.  Using "Empty the table" and "Delete the table" links on the Table Operations page of a crafted table.
4.  Opening the "Add Trigger" popup on the Triggers page of a database containing tables with a crafted name.
5.  Creating a trigger with an invalid definition for a table with a crafted name.
6.  Visualizing GIS data with a crafted label name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to create tables or modify data in a way that they can insert malicious strings in table names or data values. In most scenarios, this means the attacker would need to be an authenticated user with some level of access to the database managed by phpMyAdmin. Additionally, in the case of GIS data, crafted data must be already stored in a table.
