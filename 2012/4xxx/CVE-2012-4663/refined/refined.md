Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-4663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the DCERPC inspection engine of the Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) and Cisco ASA software.
*   Specifically, it's due to insufficient validation of DCERPC packets within a valid DCERPC session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The DCERPC inspection engine does not properly validate crafted DCERPC packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a reload (crash) of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over the network by sending crafted DCERPC packets.
*   **Transit Traffic:** Only traffic passing through the firewall (transit traffic) and being inspected by the DCERPC inspection engine can be used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote.
*   **Ability to Send Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted DCERPC packets to the targeted device.
*   **DCERPC Inspection Enabled:** The target device must have the DCERPC inspection feature enabled. Note that it's not enabled by default.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
*   The vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall modes, as well as single and multi-context modes.
*   This vulnerability, along with CVE-2012-4662, is a denial of service vulnerability related to the DCERPC inspection engine. CVE-2012-4661 is related to buffer overflow.
*   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCtr21346](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr21346) and [CSCtr27524](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr27524) are associated with this CVE.
*   Workaround: The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling DCERPC inspection.
*   The provided document includes information for verifying if DCERPC inspection is enabled via the command `show service-policy | include dcerpc`.
