The provided content is related to CVE-2012-4734.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A confused deputy attack occurs on users who are not logged in. When these users are tricked into following a malicious link, they may be subject to an attack. After supplying their credentials, the attacker can use those credentials to modify arbitrary system state.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability exists because users who are not logged in do not receive a CSRF protection warning like logged-in users would. The intervening login process obscures this warning.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can leverage a user's credentials to modify arbitrary system state.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious link that tricks users into navigating to the application when not logged in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick the user into following it. The user needs to not be logged into the system to be susceptible.
