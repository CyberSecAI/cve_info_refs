The content is related to CVE-2012-4949.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Esri ArcGIS server version 10.1 contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability due to the `where` form field not properly sanitizing SQL commands from the input when constructing a query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `where` parameter

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote authenticated attacker can execute a subset of SQL commands against the backend database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted query to the ArcGIS server via the REST service query functionality using the `where` parameter, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A remote authenticated attacker with the ability to send requests to the ArcGIS server.
