## Esri ArcGIS server 10.1 contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#795644

Original Release Date: 2012-11-09 | Last Revised: 2012-11-19

---

### Overview

Esri's ArcGIS server version 10.1 contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute a subset of SQL commands via a query operation where clause.

### Description

| The Esri ArcGIS server version 10.1 contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability ([CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)) for REST service queries. The where form field when constructing a query does not properly sanitize SQL commands from the input.  Proof-of-Concept:http://<FQDN/IP>:6080/arcgis/rest/services/<SERVICE WITH QUERY SUPPORT>/query?f=json&where=featured%3Dtrue&returnGeometry=true&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote authenticated attacker may be able to run a subset of SQL commands against the back-end database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Esri released [an update](http://support.esri.com/en/downloads/patches-servicepacks/view/productid/66/metaid/1930) to ArcGIS Server 10.1 Service Pack 1. If you cannot patch, please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Disable the query**The query operation may be disabled via ArcGIS Manager for each service.**Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an SQL request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
