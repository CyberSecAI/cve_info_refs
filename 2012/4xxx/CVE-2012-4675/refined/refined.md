RELATED: 
  - Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Full Path Disclosure by injecting malicious code in PHPSESSID.
    - Possible XSS in the update file.
    - Local File Inclusion in the installation and update files.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Full Path Disclosure.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI).
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - Full Path Disclosure could expose sensitive server information.
    - XSS could lead to malicious script execution in users' browsers, potentially compromising accounts or performing unauthorized actions.
    - LFI could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Injecting malicious code into the PHPSESSID.
    - Exploiting a vulnerability in the update file to inject XSS code.
    - Manipulating the installation or update files to perform Local File Inclusion.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to inject malicious code into the PHPSESSID.
    - Ability to manipulate the update or installation process to exploit vulnerabilities.
