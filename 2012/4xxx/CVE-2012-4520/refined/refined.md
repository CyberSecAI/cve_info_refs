Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the HTTP `Host` header within Django's `django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()` function. Specifically, the function failed to correctly parse and sanitize username/password information embedded within the `Host` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the `Host` header, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary data.
*   **HTTP Host Header Poisoning:** The vulnerability is a classic example of HTTP Host header poisoning.
*   **Incorrect Parsing:** The `get_host()` function incorrectly parsed the `Host` header, allowing username/password components to be interpreted as part of the domain name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary URL Generation:** An attacker could manipulate the `Host` header to generate and display arbitrary URLs to users, especially within password reset mechanisms, potentially redirecting them to malicious sites.
*   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** By controlling the generated URLs, attackers could redirect users to fake login pages or other deceptive content to steal credentials or sensitive data.
*   **Redirection to malicious sites:** Attacker can trick the server into generating a password reset link that redirects to an attacker controlled domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is the manipulation of the `Host` header within an HTTP request.
*   **Crafted Host Header:** Attackers can construct malicious `Host` headers containing username/password pairs or other dangerous characters.
*   The attacker would need to send a crafted request with a poisoned Host header to a django application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Django application.
*   **HTTP knowledge:** The attacker must know how to manipulate the Host header.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attack does not require any prior access or credentials.

**Technical Details from Code Changes:**

The provided code diffs show that the fix involves changes to:

*   `django/http/__init__.py`:  The `get_host()` function was modified to disallow potentially poisoned hostnames by checking for the presence of characters like `;/?@&=+$,` and raising a `SuspiciousOperation` exception if found.
*   `django/contrib/auth/views.py`: The password reset view had a vulnerability using  `request.META['HTTP_HOST']` which has been replaced with `request.get_host()` which now includes the sanitization of the Host header.
*   `django/contrib/auth/tests/views.py`: New test cases were added to ensure that poisoned `HTTP_HOST` headers are correctly detected and handled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Django versions 1.3.x before 1.3.4 and 1.4.x before 1.4.2.
*   The official Django blog post [https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/oct/17/security/](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/oct/17/security/)  provides a complete description.
*   Ubuntu security notice USN-1632-1 mentions the fix.
*   The vulnerability was reported by James Kettle.
*   The fix involves modifying the `HttpRequest.get_host()` function to raise an exception when it encounters a potentially malicious Host header.

In summary, CVE-2012-4520 is a critical vulnerability allowing for HTTP Host header poisoning which can be exploited to generate arbitrary URLs, especially in sensitive areas like password resets. This could result in phishing attacks, redirection to malicious sites, and other security problems. The fixes involve adding validation and sanitization to the `Host` header parsing and implementing proper checking of host headers before generating URLs.
