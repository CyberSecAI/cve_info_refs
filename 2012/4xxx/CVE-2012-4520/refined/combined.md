## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on Oct. 17, 2012

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.3.4 and Django 1.4.2 -- to remedy security issues reported to us.

All users are encouraged to upgrade Django immediately.

### `Host` header poisoning

Some parts of Django -- independent of end-user-written applications
-- make use of full URLs, including domain name, which are generated
from the HTTP `Host` header. Some attacks against this are beyond
Django's ability to control, and require the web server to be properly
configured; Django's documentation has for some time contained
[notes advising users on such configuration.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/security/#host-headers-and-virtual-hosting)

Django's own built-in parsing of the `Host` header is, however, still
vulnerable, as was reported to us recently. The `Host` header parsing in
Django 1.3 and Django 1.4 -- specifically,
`django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()` -- was incorrectly handling
username/password information in the header. Thus, for example, the
following `Host` header would be accepted by Django when running on
"validsite.com":

> `Host: validsite.com:random@evilsite.com`

Using this, an attacker can cause parts of Django -- particularly the
password-reset mechanism -- to generate and display arbitrary URLs to
users.

To remedy this, the parsing in `HttpRequest.get_host()` is being
modified; `Host` headers which contain potentially dangerous content
(such as username/password pairs) now raise the exception
`django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation`.

### Documentation of `HttpOnly` cookie option

As of Django 1.4, session cookies are always sent with the `HttpOnly`
flag, which provides some additional protection from cross-site
scripting attacks by denying client-side scripts access to the session
cookie.

Though not directly a security issue in Django, it has been reported
that the Django 1.4 documentation incorrectly described this change,
by claiming that this was now the default for all cookies set by
the `HttpResponse.set_cookie()` method.

The Django documentation has been updated to reflect that this only
applies to the session cookie. Users of Django are encouraged to
review their use of `set_cookie()` to ensure that
the `HttpOnly` flag is being set or unset
appropriately.

### Affected versions

The `Host` header issue described above is present in the
following versions of Django:

* Django 1.3 release series (all versions)* Django 1.4 release series (all versions)* Django master development branch (soon to become Django 1.5)

The `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue is present in
the following versions of Django:

* Django 1.4 release series (all versions)* Django master development branch

### Resolution

Patches have been applied to Django's development master branch,
and to the 1.4 and 1.3 release branches, which resolve the issues
described above. The patches may be obtained directly from the
following changesets:

* Development master branch: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/9305c0e12d43c4df999c3301a1f0c742264a657e) for
  the `Host` header issue and [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/31dcaf49a0ed6bda13a6d556412b6993a9bd41ba) for
  the `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue.
* Django 1.4: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/92d3430f12171f16f566c9050c40feefb830a4a3) for
  the `Host` header issue and [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/58806ce1530305390f593cc78b66d77443c6e1b2) for
  the `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue.
* Django 1.3: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/b45c377f8f488955e0c7069cad3f3dd21910b071) for
  the `Host` header issue.

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.4.2 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4.2/tarball/) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4.2/checksum/))
* Django 1.3.4 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.4/tarball/) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.4/checksum/))

As Django's development branch is currently in a pre-alpha state,
users are strongly advised not to be running production deployments
from it; if you are currently doing so, however, you are urged to
upgrade imediately to the latest HEAD, which contains the above
patches.

### Credits

The `Host` header issue was reported by James
Kettle. The `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue was
reported by Preston Holmes, who is now a committer on Django.

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's Trac
instance or the django-developers list. Please
see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further information.

## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on Oct. 17, 2012

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.3.4 and Django 1.4.2 -- to remedy security issues reported to us.

All users are encouraged to upgrade Django immediately.

### `Host` header poisoning

Some parts of Django -- independent of end-user-written applications
-- make use of full URLs, including domain name, which are generated
from the HTTP `Host` header. Some attacks against this are beyond
Django's ability to control, and require the web server to be properly
configured; Django's documentation has for some time contained
[notes advising users on such configuration.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/security/#host-headers-and-virtual-hosting)

Django's own built-in parsing of the `Host` header is, however, still
vulnerable, as was reported to us recently. The `Host` header parsing in
Django 1.3 and Django 1.4 -- specifically,
`django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()` -- was incorrectly handling
username/password information in the header. Thus, for example, the
following `Host` header would be accepted by Django when running on
"validsite.com":

> `Host: validsite.com:random@evilsite.com`

Using this, an attacker can cause parts of Django -- particularly the
password-reset mechanism -- to generate and display arbitrary URLs to
users.

To remedy this, the parsing in `HttpRequest.get_host()` is being
modified; `Host` headers which contain potentially dangerous content
(such as username/password pairs) now raise the exception
`django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation`.

### Documentation of `HttpOnly` cookie option

As of Django 1.4, session cookies are always sent with the `HttpOnly`
flag, which provides some additional protection from cross-site
scripting attacks by denying client-side scripts access to the session
cookie.

Though not directly a security issue in Django, it has been reported
that the Django 1.4 documentation incorrectly described this change,
by claiming that this was now the default for all cookies set by
the `HttpResponse.set_cookie()` method.

The Django documentation has been updated to reflect that this only
applies to the session cookie. Users of Django are encouraged to
review their use of `set_cookie()` to ensure that
the `HttpOnly` flag is being set or unset
appropriately.

### Affected versions

The `Host` header issue described above is present in the
following versions of Django:

* Django 1.3 release series (all versions)* Django 1.4 release series (all versions)* Django master development branch (soon to become Django 1.5)

The `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue is present in
the following versions of Django:

* Django 1.4 release series (all versions)* Django master development branch

### Resolution

Patches have been applied to Django's development master branch,
and to the 1.4 and 1.3 release branches, which resolve the issues
described above. The patches may be obtained directly from the
following changesets:

* Development master branch: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/9305c0e12d43c4df999c3301a1f0c742264a657e) for
  the `Host` header issue and [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/31dcaf49a0ed6bda13a6d556412b6993a9bd41ba) for
  the `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue.
* Django 1.4: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/92d3430f12171f16f566c9050c40feefb830a4a3) for
  the `Host` header issue and [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/58806ce1530305390f593cc78b66d77443c6e1b2) for
  the `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue.
* Django 1.3: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/b45c377f8f488955e0c7069cad3f3dd21910b071) for
  the `Host` header issue.

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.4.2 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4.2/tarball/) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4.2/checksum/))
* Django 1.3.4 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.4/tarball/) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.4/checksum/))

As Django's development branch is currently in a pre-alpha state,
users are strongly advised not to be running production deployments
from it; if you are currently doing so, however, you are urged to
upgrade imediately to the latest HEAD, which contains the above
patches.

### Credits

The `Host` header issue was reported by James
Kettle. The `HttpOnly` cookie documentation issue was
reported by Preston Holmes, who is now a committer on Django.

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's Trac
instance or the django-developers list. Please
see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further information.

Debian Bug     : 701186 696535 691145

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in python-django, a high-level
python web development framework.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-4520

    James Kettle discovered that django did not properly filter the HTTP
    Host header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit
    this to generate and cause parts of django, particularly the
    password-reset mechanism, to display arbitrary URLs to users.

CVE-2013-0305

    Orange Tsai discovered that the bundled administrative interface
    of django could expose supposedly-hidden information via its history
    log.

CVE-2013-0306

    Mozilla discovered that an attacker can abuse django's tracking of
    the number of forms in a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack
    due to extreme memory consumption.

CVE-2013-1665

    Michael Koziarski discovered that django's XML deserialization is
    vulnerable to entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD attacks.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

Let me know if I can upload it to security.debian.org. Thijs, feel free to
test it.

I will also shorty upload 1.4.2-1 to unstable and wheezy.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=865164#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-10 22:09:28 UTC  ``` It was reported that Django's built-in parsing of the Host header was incorrectly handling username/password information (in django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()).  This could allow a remote attacker to cause parts of Django, in particular the password-reset mechanism, to generate and display arbitrary URLs to end-users.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=865164#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-10 22:11:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 625210](attachment.cgi?id=625210&action=diff "Upstream patch to correct the flaw in Django 1.3.x.")

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1757-1: Django vulnerabilities

7 March 2013

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

James Kettle discovered that Django did not properly filter the Host HTTP

header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit this to

generate and display arbitrary URLs to users. Although this issue had been

previously addressed in USN-1632-1, this update adds additional hardening

measures to host header validation. This update also adds a new

ALLOWED\_HOSTS setting that can be set to a list of acceptable values for

headers. ([CVE-2012-4520](/security/CVE-2012-4520))

Orange Tsai discovered that Django incorrectly performed permission checks

when displaying the history view in the admin interface. An administrator

could use this flaw to view the history of any object, regardless of

intended permissions. ([CVE-2013-0305](/security/CVE-2013-0305))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly handled a large number of forms

when generating formsets. An attacker could use this flaw to cause Django

to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0306](/security/CVE-2013-0306))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly deserialized XML. An attacker

could use this flaw to perform entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD

attacks. This updated modified Django behaviour to no longer allow DTDs,

perform entity expansion, or fetch external entities/DTDs. ([CVE-2013-1664](/security/CVE-2013-1664),

[CVE-2013-1665](/security/CVE-2013-1665))
