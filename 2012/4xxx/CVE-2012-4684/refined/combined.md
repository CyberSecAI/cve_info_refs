Alerts are signed with a private ECDA key, so only the development team can issue new alerts. Nevertheless, prior version 0.7.0, alerts were identified by the hash of the message, which includes the signature. Bitcoin accepts BED-encoded signatures, which are malleable. An attacker build new signatures at a high rate by changing the signature of an alert still in circulation and therefore increasing dramatically the number of valid alerts spreading across the network. This leads to halting all Bitcoin nodes in the network by RAM exhaustion in approximately 4 hours. The attack is persistent, since if a nodes restarted get flooded again by online peers.**Details** There different ways an attacker can abuse the malleability of alert signatures: 1.  An attacker may try to fill the RAM of all the nodes by sending 2000 modified alerts, each of 1 Mbyte size, using padding zeros. Such 1 Mbyte alerts would slowly spread through the network, and finally reach every node.2. An attacker may use the fact that an ECDSA signature consist of two numbers (r,s), and each one can be padded by zeros. By interleaving and extending the zero padding of s and r, the attacker can build a stream of correct signatures whose sizes grows with the square root of the number of signatures generated. (for example, for X bytes of zero-padding you can generate X different modified signature alerts whose sizes are size(r)=72+i, size(s)=72+X-i for  0 <= i <= X)This attack can try to exhaust GUI resources. For example, running the attack for 1 hour over a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker is able to produce 321446 alerts. We have not evaluated how Qt responds in each platform to 321446  calls to QMessageBox::critical() without user interaction, but it's plausible that the application halts.3. An attacker can try to exhaust the victim's computer CPU by:3.1. Forcing excessive signature verification time (this only happens with the very first small alerts sent, and for old CPUs )3.2. Forcing excessive iterations of the loop : for (map<uint256, CAlert>::iterator mi = mapAlerts.begin(); mi != mapAlerts.end();)As an example, in the first hour an attacker is able to send 321446 small alerts. The following hour the attacker is able to send 207757 alerts, starting at size 1218. With a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker can send this last alerts at 52 alerts/second. The code block inside the for loop will be executed 321446\*52 = 16,890,430 times, and that takes more than a second to process on an average computer, so CPU is exhausted in the loop.To maximize the damage of an attack, an attacker requires an existing alert that is relevant for all versions of the protocol, and one that will not have expired and is still in the relay interval.  With such alert, the attacker can reach the maximum number of nodes. Because of this, the vulnerability should not be notified to users by using the alert system. By doing so the attacker may receive the tool required to mount the best possible attack.**Attack Scenario**The best attack is to harm the entire network and possibly generate a rush to the coin. To simplify the analysis, we assume that an average connection bandwidth is 64 Kbytes/sec and that each node has 2 GB of RAM, plus 2 GB of swap space. We assume the attacker executes the attack 1 described in the previous section, which tries to exhaust RAM, but leaves the CPU resources intact to keep spreading the fake alerts. If the such an attack is executed, every node in the network will start trashing after 1.5 hours approximately, as Bitcoin application will be using more than 1.5 GB of RAM. After 2 hours, every node running in Windows 32-bits will halt, since the address space of 2 Gb will be filled. After 8.7 hours, every 64-bit node still alive will fill both the 2 Gb of RAM and the 4 gigabytes of hard disk swap space assumed, and the Bitcoin application will halt.It is supposed that, in Bitcoin-Qt application, QMessageBox::critical() with modal=false will be called for each alert, so the application may crash much sooner due to lack of Windows or whatever GUI resources Qt uses. This is only relevant to Bitcoin-qt and not Bitcoind releases.**Suggested Solutions for the 0.7.0 release**1. Change the way the hash of alerts is computed: exclude the signature from the hash.2. Reject alert signatures that are not DER-encoded.3. Check setKnown before checking signatures.4. Support a special fixed alert message that cancels all previous alerts. This would be a damage control measure if all other protections are violated.Solutions 1,3 and 4 were implemented in Bitcoin version 0.7.0.**Disclosure Time-line**2012-08-24 - Vulnerability reported to Gavin Andressen and other core devs.2012-08-24 - Gavin Andressen acknowledges report2012-08-26  Private discussions of Gavin Andressen, Gregory Maxwell and Sergio Lerner on how to address the vulnerability.2012-08-26  Fix finally scheduled for the 0.7.0 release2012-09-17 - Bitcoin version 0.7.0 released2013-03-01 - Patched Bitcoin versions reach 80% of the network nodes upgraded. 2013-03-01 - Vulnerability disclosure**Credit**This vulnerability was discovered by Sergio Demian Lerner, from Certimix.comBitcointalk user Enochian was the first to publish BER/DER encoding problems of Bitcoin signatures in this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8392.0 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8392.0).This report was written by SDL.

## Overview

Bitcoin protocol has an alert system to spread important news regarding the digital currency. Alerts are signed with a private ECDA key, so only the development team can issue new alerts. Nevertheless, prior version 0.7.0, alerts were identified by the hash of the message, which includes the signature. Bitcoin accepts BED-encoded signatures, which are malleable.
An attacker build new signatures at a high rate by changing the signature of an alert still in circulation and therefore increasing dramatically the number of valid alerts spreading across the network. This leads to halting all Bitcoin nodes in the network by RAM exhaustion in approximately 4 hours. The attack is persistent, since if a nodes restarted get flooded again by online peers.

## Details

There different ways an attacker can abuse the malleability of alert signatures:

- 1. An attacker may try to fill the RAM of all the nodes by sending 2000 modified alerts, each of 1 Mbyte size, using padding zeros. Such 1 Mbyte alerts would slowly spread through the network, and finally reach every node.

- 2. An attacker may use the fact that an ECDSA signature consist of two numbers (r,s), and each one can be padded by zeros. By interleaving and extending the zero padding of s and r, the attacker can build a stream of correct signatures whose sizes grows with the square root of the number of signatures generated.
(for example, for X bytes of zero-padding you can generate X different modified signature alerts whose sizes are size(r)=72+i, size(s)=72+X-i for 0 <= i <= X)

This attack can try to exhaust GUI resources. For example, running the attack for 1 hour over a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker is able to produce 321446 alerts. We have not evaluated how Qt responds in each platform to 321446 calls to QMessageBox::critical() without user interaction, but it's plausible that the application halts.

- 3. An attacker can try to exhaust the victim's computer CPU by:

- 3.1. Forcing excessive signature verification time (this only happens with the very first small alerts sent, and for old CPUs )

- 3.2. Forcing excessive iterations of the loop : for (map<uint256, CAlert>::iterator mi = mapAlerts.begin(); mi != mapAlerts.end()Wink

As an example, in the first hour an attacker is able to send 321446 small alerts. The following hour the attacker is able to send 207757 alerts, starting at size 1218. With a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker can send this last alerts at 52 alerts/second. The code block inside the for loop will be executed 321446\*52 = 16,890,430 times, and that takes more than a second to process on an average computer, so CPU is exhausted in the loop.

To maximize the damage of an attack, an attacker requires an existing alert that is relevant for all versions of the protocol, and one that will not have expired and is still in the relay interval. With such alert, the attacker can reach the maximum number of nodes. Because of this, the vulnerability should not be notified to users by using the alert system. By doing so the attacker may receive the tool required to mount the best possible attack.

## Attack Scenario

The best attack is to harm the entire network and possibly generate a rush to the coin. To simplify the analysis, we assume that an average connection bandwidth is 64 Kbytes/sec and that each node has 2 GB of RAM, plus 2 GB of swap space. We assume the attacker executes the attack 1 described in the previous section, which tries to exhaust RAM, but leaves the CPU resources intact to keep spreading the fake alerts. If the such an attack is executed, every node in the network will start trashing after 1.5 hours approximately, as Bitcoin application will be using more than 1.5 GB of RAM. After 2 hours, every node running in Windows 32-bits will halt, since the address space of 2 Gb will be filled. After 8.7 hours, every 64-bit node still alive will fill both the 2 Gb of RAM and the 4 gigabytes of hard disk swap space assumed, and the Bitcoin application will halt.

It is supposed that, in Bitcoin-Qt application, QMessageBox::critical() with modal=false will be called for each alert, so the application may crash much sooner due to lack of Windows or whatever GUI resources Qt uses. This is only relevant to Bitcoin-qt and not Bitcoind releases.

## Suggested Solutions for the 0.7.0 release

1. Change the way the hash of alerts is computed: exclude the signature from the hash.
2. Reject alert signatures that are not DER-encoded.
3. Check setKnown before checking signatures.
4. Support a special fixed alert message that cancels all previous alerts. This would be a damage control measure if all other protections are violated.

Solutions 1,3 and 4 were implemented in Bitcoin version 0.7.0.

Alerts are signed with a private ECDA key, so only the development team can issue new alerts. Nevertheless, prior version 0.7.0, alerts were identified by the hash of the message, which includes the signature. Bitcoin accepts BED-encoded signatures, which are malleable. An attacker build new signatures at a high rate by changing the signature of an alert still in circulation and therefore increasing dramatically the number of valid alerts spreading across the network. This leads to halting all Bitcoin nodes in the network by RAM exhaustion in approximately 4 hours. The attack is persistent, since if a nodes restarted get flooded again by online peers.**Details** There different ways an attacker can abuse the malleability of alert signatures: 1.  An attacker may try to fill the RAM of all the nodes by sending 2000 modified alerts, each of 1 Mbyte size, using padding zeros. Such 1 Mbyte alerts would slowly spread through the network, and finally reach every node.2. An attacker may use the fact that an ECDSA signature consist of two numbers (r,s), and each one can be padded by zeros. By interleaving and extending the zero padding of s and r, the attacker can build a stream of correct signatures whose sizes grows with the square root of the number of signatures generated. (for example, for X bytes of zero-padding you can generate X different modified signature alerts whose sizes are size(r)=72+i, size(s)=72+X-i for  0 <= i <= X)This attack can try to exhaust GUI resources. For example, running the attack for 1 hour over a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker is able to produce 321446 alerts. We have not evaluated how Qt responds in each platform to 321446  calls to QMessageBox::critical() without user interaction, but it's plausible that the application halts.3. An attacker can try to exhaust the victim's computer CPU by:3.1. Forcing excessive signature verification time (this only happens with the very first small alerts sent, and for old CPUs )3.2. Forcing excessive iterations of the loop : for (map<uint256, CAlert>::iterator mi = mapAlerts.begin(); mi != mapAlerts.end()WinkAs an example, in the first hour an attacker is able to send 321446 small alerts. The following hour the attacker is able to send 207757 alerts, starting at size 1218. With a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker can send this last alerts at 52 alerts/second. The code block inside the for loop will be executed 321446\*52 = 16,890,430 times, and that takes more than a second to process on an average computer, so CPU is exhausted in the loop.To maximize the damage of an attack, an attacker requires an existing alert that is relevant for all versions of the protocol, and one that will not have expired and is still in the relay interval.  With such alert, the attacker can reach the maximum number of nodes. Because of this, the vulnerability should not be notified to users by using the alert system. By doing so the attacker may receive the tool required to mount the best possible attack.**Attack Scenario**The best attack is to harm the entire network and possibly generate a rush to the coin. To simplify the analysis, we assume that an average connection bandwidth is 64 Kbytes/sec and that each node has 2 GB of RAM, plus 2 GB of swap space. We assume the attacker executes the attack 1 described in the previous section, which tries to exhaust RAM, but leaves the CPU resources intact to keep spreading the fake alerts. If the such an attack is executed, every node in the network will start trashing after 1.5 hours approximately, as Bitcoin application will be using more than 1.5 GB of RAM. After 2 hours, every node running in Windows 32-bits will halt, since the address space of 2 Gb will be filled. After 8.7 hours, every 64-bit node still alive will fill both the 2 Gb of RAM and the 4 gigabytes of hard disk swap space assumed, and the Bitcoin application will halt.It is supposed that, in Bitcoin-Qt application, QMessageBox::critical() with modal=false will be called for each alert, so the application may crash much sooner due to lack of Windows or whatever GUI resources Qt uses. This is only relevant to Bitcoin-qt and not Bitcoind releases.**Suggested Solutions for the 0.7.0 release**1. Change the way the hash of alerts is computed: exclude the signature from the hash.2. Reject alert signatures that are not DER-encoded.3. Check setKnown before checking signatures.4. Support a special fixed alert message that cancels all previous alerts. This would be a damage control measure if all other protections are violated.Solutions 1,3 and 4 were implemented in Bitcoin version 0.7.0.**Disclosure Time-line**2012-08-24 - Vulnerability reported to Gavin Andressen and other core devs.2012-08-24 - Gavin Andressen acknowledges report2012-08-26  Private discussions of Gavin Andressen, Gregory Maxwell and Sergio Lerner on how to address the vulnerability.2012-08-26  Fix finally scheduled for the 0.7.0 release2012-09-17 - Bitcoin version 0.7.0 released2013-03-01 - Patched Bitcoin versions reach 80% of the network nodes upgraded. 2013-03-01 - Vulnerability disclosure**Credit**This vulnerability was discovered by Sergio Demian Lerner, from Certimix.comBitcointalk user Enochian was the first to publish BER/DER encoding problems of Bitcoin signatures in this thread: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8392.0>.This report was written by SDL. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Each signature has exactly one DER-encoded ASN.1 octet representation, but openssl doesn't enforce this, and as long as a signature isn't horribly malformed, it will be accepted.So you can sit on the network, watch for transactions, and echo them with the signatures slightly tweeked, but still valid.  These new transactions will have different hashes, and will compete with the original transactions for inclusion in a block.  When a cloned transaction beats out the original for block inclusion, it will leave the original in the owners wallet unconfirmable forever, resulting in inconvenience and unspendable coins.  Quick echoing and network latency gives this a finite chance of happening.Of course, you can't create or destroy coins with this, and the money still winds up at the right destination. However, the typical user isn't going to know how to restore an old wallet and rescan the block chain to get his bitcoin client back to working condition.It might be a good idea to patch this before some enterprising person with excess time on their hands (cough) makes a cloned transaction echobot. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

As soon as a modified echo of the transaction is included in a block, both sender and receiver will see this transaction too. The old transaction will linger on however, unconfirmed.You're right.I got curious and tried it this morning.  I created two transactions that did the same thing.  The first I let my client see, but didn't let it get broadcast.  The second I broadcast, but didn't let my client see.  Then I waited to see what would happen when the latter transaction arrived back in a block, double spending the earlier unconfirmable one in the wallet.It added the second transaction to the wallet quite gracefully, and correctly computed the balance.  So this is less of a problem than I originally thought.I should point out, however, that it used to be possible to segfault the ASN.1 parser in openssl by giving it garbage to decode.  The last such known bug was patched a number of revs back, but it not beyond the realm of possibility that another similar bug might be discovered at some time in the future.So it's probably a good idea not to pass stuff that comes in over the wire to openssl without checking it first, just in case. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Bitcoin assumes that you don't copy your wallet around today.Note that it doesn't undermine the security of the system though.

Alerts are signed with a private ECDA key, so only the development team can issue new alerts. Nevertheless, prior version 0.7.0, alerts were identified by the hash of the message, which includes the signature. Bitcoin accepts BED-encoded signatures, which are malleable. An attacker build new signatures at a high rate by changing the signature of an alert still in circulation and therefore increasing dramatically the number of valid alerts spreading across the network. This leads to halting all Bitcoin nodes in the network by RAM exhaustion in approximately 4 hours. The attack is persistent, since if a nodes restarted get flooded again by online peers.**Details** There different ways an attacker can abuse the malleability of alert signatures: 1.  An attacker may try to fill the RAM of all the nodes by sending 2000 modified alerts, each of 1 Mbyte size, using padding zeros. Such 1 Mbyte alerts would slowly spread through the network, and finally reach every node.2. An attacker may use the fact that an ECDSA signature consist of two numbers (r,s), and each one can be padded by zeros. By interleaving and extending the zero padding of s and r, the attacker can build a stream of correct signatures whose sizes grows with the square root of the number of signatures generated. (for example, for X bytes of zero-padding you can generate X different modified signature alerts whose sizes are size(r)=72+i, size(s)=72+X-i for  0 <= i <= X)This attack can try to exhaust GUI resources. For example, running the attack for 1 hour over a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker is able to produce 321446 alerts. We have not evaluated how Qt responds in each platform to 321446  calls to QMessageBox::critical() without user interaction, but it's plausible that the application halts.3. An attacker can try to exhaust the victim's computer CPU by:3.1. Forcing excessive signature verification time (this only happens with the very first small alerts sent, and for old CPUs )3.2. Forcing excessive iterations of the loop : for (map<uint256, CAlert>::iterator mi = mapAlerts.begin(); mi != mapAlerts.end()WinkAs an example, in the first hour an attacker is able to send 321446 small alerts. The following hour the attacker is able to send 207757 alerts, starting at size 1218. With a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker can send this last alerts at 52 alerts/second. The code block inside the for loop will be executed 321446\*52 = 16,890,430 times, and that takes more than a second to process on an average computer, so CPU is exhausted in the loop.To maximize the damage of an attack, an attacker requires an existing alert that is relevant for all versions of the protocol, and one that will not have expired and is still in the relay interval.  With such alert, the attacker can reach the maximum number of nodes. Because of this, the vulnerability should not be notified to users by using the alert system. By doing so the attacker may receive the tool required to mount the best possible attack.**Attack Scenario**The best attack is to harm the entire network and possibly generate a rush to the coin. To simplify the analysis, we assume that an average connection bandwidth is 64 Kbytes/sec and that each node has 2 GB of RAM, plus 2 GB of swap space. We assume the attacker executes the attack 1 described in the previous section, which tries to exhaust RAM, but leaves the CPU resources intact to keep spreading the fake alerts. If the such an attack is executed, every node in the network will start trashing after 1.5 hours approximately, as Bitcoin application will be using more than 1.5 GB of RAM. After 2 hours, every node running in Windows 32-bits will halt, since the address space of 2 Gb will be filled. After 8.7 hours, every 64-bit node still alive will fill both the 2 Gb of RAM and the 4 gigabytes of hard disk swap space assumed, and the Bitcoin application will halt.It is supposed that, in Bitcoin-Qt application, QMessageBox::critical() with modal=false will be called for each alert, so the application may crash much sooner due to lack of Windows or whatever GUI resources Qt uses. This is only relevant to Bitcoin-qt and not Bitcoind releases.**Suggested Solutions for the 0.7.0 release**1. Change the way the hash of alerts is computed: exclude the signature from the hash.2. Reject alert signatures that are not DER-encoded.3. Check setKnown before checking signatures.4. Support a special fixed alert message that cancels all previous alerts. This would be a damage control measure if all other protections are violated.Solutions 1,3 and 4 were implemented in Bitcoin version 0.7.0.**Disclosure Time-line**2012-08-24 - Vulnerability reported to Gavin Andressen and other core devs.2012-08-24 - Gavin Andressen acknowledges report2012-08-26  Private discussions of Gavin Andressen, Gregory Maxwell and Sergio Lerner on how to address the vulnerability.2012-08-26  Fix finally scheduled for the 0.7.0 release2012-09-17 - Bitcoin version 0.7.0 released2013-03-01 - Patched Bitcoin versions reach 80% of the network nodes upgraded. 2013-03-01 - Vulnerability disclosure**Credit**This vulnerability was discovered by Sergio Demian Lerner, from Certimix.comBitcointalk user Enochian was the first to publish BER/DER encoding problems of Bitcoin signatures in this thread: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8392.0>.This report was written by SDL. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

By interleaving and extending the zero padding of s and r, the attacker can build a stream of correct signatures whose sizes grows with the square root of the number of signatures generated. (for example, for X bytes of zero-padding you can generate X different modified signature alerts whose sizes are size(r)=72+i, size(s)=72+X-i for  0 <= i <= X)This attack can try to exhaust GUI resources. For example, running the attack for 1 hour over a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker is able to produce 321446 alerts. We have not evaluated how Qt responds in each platform to 321446  calls to QMessageBox::critical() without user interaction, but it's plausible that the application halts.3. An attacker can try to exhaust the victim's computer CPU by:3.1. Forcing excessive signature verification time (this only happens with the very first small alerts sent, and for old CPUs )3.2. Forcing excessive iterations of the loop : for (map<uint256, CAlert>::iterator mi = mapAlerts.begin(); mi != mapAlerts.end()WinkAs an example, in the first hour an attacker is able to send 321446 small alerts. The following hour the attacker is able to send 207757 alerts, starting at size 1218. With a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker can send this last alerts at 52 alerts/second. The code block inside the for loop will be executed 321446\*52 = 16,890,430 times, and that takes more than a second to process on an average computer, so CPU is exhausted in the loop.To maximize the damage of an attack, an attacker requires an existing alert that is relevant for all versions of the protocol, and one that will not have expired and is still in the relay interval.  With such alert, the attacker can reach the maximum number of nodes. Because of this, the vulnerability should not be notified to users by using the alert system. By doing so the attacker may receive the tool required to mount the best possible attack.**Attack Scenario**The best attack is to harm the entire network and possibly generate a rush to the coin. To simplify the analysis, we assume that an average connection bandwidth is 64 Kbytes/sec and that each node has 2 GB of RAM, plus 2 GB of swap space. We assume the attacker executes the attack 1 described in the previous section, which tries to exhaust RAM, but leaves the CPU resources intact to keep spreading the fake alerts. If the such an attack is executed, every node in the network will start trashing after 1.5 hours approximately, as Bitcoin application will be using more than 1.5 GB of RAM. After 2 hours, every node running in Windows 32-bits will halt, since the address space of 2 Gb will be filled. After 8.7 hours, every 64-bit node still alive will fill both the 2 Gb of RAM and the 4 gigabytes of hard disk swap space assumed, and the Bitcoin application will halt.It is supposed that, in Bitcoin-Qt application, QMessageBox::critical() with modal=false will be called for each alert, so the application may crash much sooner due to lack of Windows or whatever GUI resources Qt uses. This is only relevant to Bitcoin-qt and not Bitcoind releases.**Suggested Solutions for the 0.7.0 release**1. Change the way the hash of alerts is computed: exclude the signature from the hash.2. Reject alert signatures that are not DER-encoded.3. Check setKnown before checking signatures.4. Support a special fixed alert message that cancels all previous alerts. This would be a damage control measure if all other protections are violated.Solutions 1,3 and 4 were implemented in Bitcoin version 0.7.0.**Disclosure Time-line**2012-08-24 - Vulnerability reported to Gavin Andressen and other core devs.2012-08-24 - Gavin Andressen acknowledges report2012-08-26  Private discussions of Gavin Andressen, Gregory Maxwell and Sergio Lerner on how to address the vulnerability.2012-08-26  Fix finally scheduled for the 0.7.0 release2012-09-17 - Bitcoin version 0.7.0 released2013-03-01 - Patched Bitcoin versions reach 80% of the network nodes upgraded. 2013-03-01 - Vulnerability disclosure**Credit**This vulnerability was discovered by Sergio Demian Lerner, from Certimix.comBitcointalk user Enochian was the first to publish BER/DER encoding problems of Bitcoin signatures in this thread: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8392.0>.This report was written by SDL. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Alerts are signed with a private ECDA key, so only the development team can issue new alerts. Nevertheless, prior version 0.7.0, alerts were identified by the hash of the message, which includes the signature. Bitcoin accepts BED-encoded signatures, which are malleable. An attacker build new signatures at a high rate by changing the signature of an alert still in circulation and therefore increasing dramatically the number of valid alerts spreading across the network. This leads to halting all Bitcoin nodes in the network by RAM exhaustion in approximately 4 hours. The attack is persistent, since if a nodes restarted get flooded again by online peers.**Details** There different ways an attacker can abuse the malleability of alert signatures: 1.  An attacker may try to fill the RAM of all the nodes by sending 2000 modified alerts, each of 1 Mbyte size, using padding zeros. Such 1 Mbyte alerts would slowly spread through the network, and finally reach every node.2. An attacker may use the fact that an ECDSA signature consist of two numbers (r,s), and each one can be padded by zeros. By interleaving and extending the zero padding of s and r, the attacker can build a stream of correct signatures whose sizes grows with the square root of the number of signatures generated. (for example, for X bytes of zero-padding you can generate X different modified signature alerts whose sizes are size(r)=72+i, size(s)=72+X-i for  0 <= i <= X)This attack can try to exhaust GUI resources.

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

```

## CVE-2010-5140

Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

## Overview

Bitcoin protocol has an alert system to spread important news regarding the digital currency. Alerts are signed with a private ECDA key, so only the development team can issue new alerts. Nevertheless, prior version 0.7.0, alerts were identified by the hash of the message, which includes the signature. Bitcoin accepts BED-encoded signatures, which are malleable.
An attacker build new signatures at a high rate by changing the signature of an alert still in circulation and therefore increasing dramatically the number of valid alerts spreading across the network. This leads to halting all Bitcoin nodes in the network by RAM exhaustion in approximately 4 hours. The attack is persistent, since if a nodes restarted get flooded again by online peers.

## Details

There different ways an attacker can abuse the malleability of alert signatures:

- 1. An attacker may try to fill the RAM of all the nodes by sending 2000 modified alerts, each of 1 Mbyte size, using padding zeros. Such 1 Mbyte alerts would slowly spread through the network, and finally reach every node.

- 2. An attacker may use the fact that an ECDSA signature consist of two numbers (r,s), and each one can be padded by zeros. By interleaving and extending the zero padding of s and r, the attacker can build a stream of correct signatures whose sizes grows with the square root of the number of signatures generated.
(for example, for X bytes of zero-padding you can generate X different modified signature alerts whose sizes are size(r)=72+i, size(s)=72+X-i for 0 <= i <= X)

This attack can try to exhaust GUI resources. For example, running the attack for 1 hour over a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker is able to produce 321446 alerts. We have not evaluated how Qt responds in each platform to 321446 calls to QMessageBox::critical() without user interaction, but it's plausible that the application halts.

- 3. An attacker can try to exhaust the victim's computer CPU by:

- 3.1. Forcing excessive signature verification time (this only happens with the very first small alerts sent, and for old CPUs )

- 3.2. Forcing excessive iterations of the loop : for (map<uint256, CAlert>::iterator mi = mapAlerts.begin(); mi != mapAlerts.end()Wink

As an example, in the first hour an attacker is able to send 321446 small alerts. The following hour the attacker is able to send 207757 alerts, starting at size 1218. With a 64 Kbytes/sec link, the attacker can send this last alerts at 52 alerts/second. The code block inside the for loop will be executed 321446\*52 = 16,890,430 times, and that takes more than a second to process on an average computer, so CPU is exhausted in the loop.

To maximize the damage of an attack, an attacker requires an existing alert that is relevant for all versions of the protocol, and one that will not have expired and is still in the relay interval. With such alert, the attacker can reach the maximum number of nodes. Because of this, the vulnerability should not be notified to users by using the alert system. By doing so the attacker may receive the tool required to mount the best possible attack.

## Attack Scenario

The best attack is to harm the entire network and possibly generate a rush to the coin. To simplify the analysis, we assume that an average connection bandwidth is 64 Kbytes/sec and that each node has 2 GB of RAM, plus 2 GB of swap space. We assume the attacker executes the attack 1 described in the previous section, which tries to exhaust RAM, but leaves the CPU resources intact to keep spreading the fake alerts. If the such an attack is executed, every node in the network will start trashing after 1.5 hours approximately, as Bitcoin application will be using more than 1.5 GB of RAM. After 2 hours, every node running in Windows 32-bits will halt, since the address space of 2 Gb will be filled. After 8.7 hours, every 64-bit node still alive will fill both the 2 Gb of RAM and the 4 gigabytes of hard disk swap space assumed, and the Bitcoin application will halt.

It is supposed that, in Bitcoin-Qt application, QMessageBox::critical() with modal=false will be called for each alert, so the application may crash much sooner due to lack of Windows or whatever GUI resources Qt uses. This is only relevant to Bitcoin-qt and not Bitcoind releases.

## Suggested Solutions for the 0.7.0 release

1. Change the way the hash of alerts is computed: exclude the signature from the hash.
2. Reject alert signatures that are not DER-encoded.
3. Check setKnown before checking signatures.
4. Support a special fixed alert message that cancels all previous alerts. This would be a damage control measure if all other protections are violated.

Solutions 1,3 and 4 were implemented in Bitcoin version 0.7.0.

Alerts are signed with a private ECDA key, so only the development team can issue new alerts. Alerts signatures are checked for every alert that is received. Each check takes some time, usually between 1 and 4 msecs. The verification time does not depend on the correctness of the signature. Therefore an attacker may flood a node with invalid alerts generated on-the-fly at no cost, and exhaust the victim's node CPU.**Details** The Satoshi client prior version 0.7.0 does not define an alert signature verification failure as a DoS attack (using  return DoS(...); ).A malicious client app can start sending invalid alerts at a rate of almost 3000 alerts/second for a 64 Kbytes/sec link. The victim's computer will reach 100% CPU utilization for the core associated with the ThreadMessageHandler2() thread. Although that thread has priority THREAD\_PRIORITY\_BELOW\_NORMAL, the computer will suffer a noticeable slowdown. The attack works even with a 3 Kbytes/sec bandwidth usage, so even a slow network link can be used for the attack.Alerts can be as short as 10 bytes. Here is a complete alert (without network message headers) that has an incorrect signature:    [0, 8, 48, 6, 2, 1, 10, 2, 1, 10]It has zero length payload and (r,s) = (10,10)The problem is still present even if you send the attacker sends correct alerts, previously received, since CheckSignature() is called before the signature is checked against mapAlerts. It was verified that, in an average computer, sending a 188-bytes correct alert continuously on a 64 Kbytes/sec link still rises the victim's CPU usage to 100%.**Possible Attack Scenarios** - An attacker has a direct connection to the victim's node.- An attacker has a direct connections to a set of nodes that, if put off-line, could cut the network in two unconnected components. The attacker may try then to double-spend in each of the components. Since the attack requires very few resources for the attacker, he may try to attack all those nodes at once from a single computer.**Suggested Solutions for the 0.7.0 version**1- Disconnect from any node that sends a bad alert (return DoS(...))2- Check that an alert is not verified more than once by checking the existence of the alert in mapAlerts before doing a CheckSignature()Both solutions were adopted in version 0.7.0, although a lower penalty is given to nodes for sending single incorrect alerts.**Disclosure Timeline**2012-08-23 - Vulnerability reported to Gavin Andressen and other core devs.2012-08-23 - Gavin Andressen acknowledges report and asserts that version 0.7 will be patched against these problems.2012-09-17 - Bitcoin version 0.7.0 released2013-03-01 - Patched Bitcoin version reach 80% of the network nodes upgraded. 2013-03-01 - Vulnerability disclosure**Credit**This vulnerability was discovered by Sergio Demian Lerner, from Certimix.comThis report was written by SDL. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
