{
  "CVE-2012-4684": {
    "Root cause": "The Bitcoin alert system identified alerts by the hash of the message, which included the signature. Bitcoin accepted BED-encoded signatures, which are malleable, allowing attackers to create many valid signatures by modifying existing ones.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Malleable signatures",
      "Inclusion of signature in alert hash",
      "Lack of DER encoding enforcement",
      "Missing check of setKnown before signature verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "A network-wide denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting RAM in approximately 4 hours. Attack can also exhaust GUI resources and CPU.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a large number of modified alerts to exhaust RAM.",
      "Sending modified signatures with padding to grow the size of alerts.",
      "Exploiting excessive signature verification time (old CPUs).",
      "Forcing excessive iterations of the alert processing loop."
   ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs an initial valid alert that is relevant for all protocol versions and still within the relay interval. Attacker also needs network connection to target nodes to send crafted alerts."
