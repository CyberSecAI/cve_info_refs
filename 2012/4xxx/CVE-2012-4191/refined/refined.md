        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a logic error in `mozilla::net::FailDelayManager::Lookup`. Specifically, the code doesn't break after finding a matching entry but continues iterating, which can lead to an out-of-bounds access when removing expired entries. If `Lookup()` returns an index for an item that is no longer valid (e.g., due to a concurrent removal), it might now be off the end of the `nsTArray`. The `RemoveElementAt()` function doesn't have bounds checking in release builds, leading to a crash when `delete fail` is called.",
