# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-86

## Heap memory corruption issues found using Address Sanitizer

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Atte Kettunen
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* Firefox ESR 10.0.8
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.8

### Description

Security researcher **Atte Kettunen** from OUSPG reported
several heap memory corruption issues found using the Address Sanitizer tool.
These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

## Synopsis

Critical: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1351)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3982,
CVE-2012-3988, CVE-2012-3990, CVE-2012-3995, CVE-2012-4179, CVE-2012-4180,
CVE-2012-4181, CVE-2012-4182, CVE-2012-4183, CVE-2012-4185, CVE-2012-4186,
CVE-2012-4187, CVE-2012-4188)

Two flaws in Thunderbird could allow malicious content to bypass intended
restrictions, possibly leading to information disclosure, or Thunderbird
executing arbitrary code. Note that the information disclosure issue could
possibly be combined with other flaws to achieve arbitrary code execution.
(CVE-2012-3986, CVE-2012-3991)

Multiple flaws were found in the location object implementation in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site
scripting attacks, script injection, or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2012-1956,
CVE-2012-3992, CVE-2012-3994)

Two flaws were found in the way Chrome Object Wrappers were implemented.
Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks or
cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-3993, CVE-2012-4184)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Soroush Dalili,
miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen, Johnny Stenback, Alice White,
moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these
issues.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3982 CVE-2012-3986 CVE-2012-3990 CVE-2012-3991
                 CVE-2012-4179 CVE-2012-4180 CVE-2012-4182 CVE-2012-4186
                 CVE-2012-4188

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceape, an internet
suite based on Seamonkey:

CVE-2012-3982
        Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
        allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
        corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
        arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
        Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
        A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
        implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
        code via unspecified vectors, related to the
        nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
        Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
        GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
        the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
        impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
        attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
        service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
        remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
        vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
        memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
        allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
        unspecified vectors.

Additionally, this update fixes a regression in the patch for
CVE-2012-3959, released in DSA-2554-1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-16.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863626#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-06 05:35:58 UTC  ``` Security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-86.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Atte Kettunen as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863626#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:33:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1351 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1351.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863626#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:54:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1350.html>   ``` |  |

Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3982 CVE-2012-3986 CVE-2012-3990 CVE-2012-3991
    	         CVE-2012-4179 CVE-2012-4180 CVE-2012-4182 CVE-2012-4186
		 CVE-2012-4188

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
version of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-3982
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
	Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
	A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
	implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
	code via unspecified vectors, related to the
	nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
	Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
	GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
	the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
	impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
	attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
	service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
	vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
	memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
	allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze14.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil
Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with
multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

Also before that ASAN-report there is following assertion
###!!! ASSERTION: insPos too small: 'insPos >= 1', file /builds/slave/try-lnx64-dbg/build/content/base/src/nsINode.cpp, line 1798
There is also few warnings you can see in the attached full ASAN-report.

It's really hard to reproduce this actually. I've been able to do it once but no more in a few dozen tries.
I'm not really familiar with the involved code too. I don't know who is though.

I think that this repro-file is much more reliable than the original one.

I can reproduce the crash using the first testcase but not using the latter one.

For my laptop that latter file is almost 100% sure. There might be some race-condition. You could try to change the amount of the duplicated line inside the crash-function in the testcase, or try to change the for-loop rounds in that function in the first testcase.

The 2nd testcase crashes reliably for me in a Linux64 debug build (non-asan).
It crashes in memmove() called from
nsTArray\_base<nsTArrayDefaultAllocator>::ShiftData:
(gdb) list
240 start \*= elemSize;
241 newLen \*= elemSize;
242 oldLen \*= elemSize;
243 num \*= elemSize;
244 char \*base = reinterpret\_cast<char\*>(mHdr + 1) + start;
245 memmove(base + newLen, base + oldLen, num);
246 }
247 }
248
(gdb) p base
$1 = 0x8000ddbc2490 <Address 0x8000ddbc2490 out of bounds>
(gdb) p start
$2 = 4294967288
(gdb) p/x start
$3 = 0xfffffff8
(gdb)
If something happened to be allocated at |base + newLen| then it's
potentially exploitable?
The patch fixed it for me.
There's about 2000 crash-stats reports in the past 4 weeks that match
"memmove | nsTArray\_base<nsTArrayDefaultAllocator>::ShiftData".

This appears to affect ESR-10 as well from code inspection (don't have an esr-10 ASAN build)

Now's the time to land and nominate for uplift without putting the FF16 release at risk.

Yup. I'm just making sure it builds locally because esr10 is a little different...

Both testcases reliably crash Firefox 18.0a1 Nightly debug 2012-09-01 (non-asan) for me.
Neither testcase crashes:
\* Firefox 18.0a1 Nightly debug (non-asan) 2012-09-21
\* Firefox 17.0a2 Aurora debug (non-asan) 2012-09-23
\* Firefox 16.0 Beta debug (non-asan) 2012-09-23
\* Firefox 10.0.8esrpre esr10 debug (non-asan) 2012-09-23
Question, is that sufficient to call this verified, or does the verification require checking against ASan builds?

I never used ASAn builds with this. The problem is clear so verifying without asan should be enough.

		 CVE-2012-4188

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, Debian's
version of the Mozilla Firefox web browser.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-3982
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
	A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
	implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
	code via unspecified vectors, related to the
	nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
	GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
	the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
	impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
	attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
	service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
	vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
	memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
	allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.16-19.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.8esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

patch v0
[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): forever (since this coded was added)
User impact if declined: likely exploitable heap overwrite
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): tested locally in normal and ASAN builds
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): extremely low, will reject some invalid files that may previously have played corrupt audio
Do we also want this on ESR10?

We'll need a sec rating on this to evaluate for ESR and in case there are regressions or this needs to be backed out. Why is this requesting mozilla-release approval? You say this bug has been here "forever" since this code was added - what release was that?

Does the security team do that evaluation or me? I couldn't find any docs in the wiki that explained the process, and the bugs I've worked on in the past had already been tagged.

Sorry, it was Firefox 3.5. But it turns out I was wrong--the original code that shipped in 3.5 didn't validate the frame size, but it also didn't use that value to size buffers. So this became exploitable when the code was refactored in [bug 635649](/show_bug.cgi?id=635649 "VERIFIED FIXED - Refactor Wave backend to use content/media nsBuiltinDecoder framework"), which shipped in Firefox 5.

Not a chemspill issue so minusing for mozilla-release but we'll take this on the ESR.

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))
