{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "User passwords are stored in a reversible XOR encrypted format.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate Encryption Strength: The application uses XOR encryption, which is easily reversible.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "If a malicious user obtains the encrypted passwords, they can decrypt them.",
  "Attack vectors": "Obtaining the encrypted password database.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to obtain the encrypted password file and the decryption key."
