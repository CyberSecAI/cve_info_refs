### CVE-2012-4681 Java 7 0-Day vulnerability analysis

**Update Aug.30, 2012**

[Oracle issued update 7 (7u7), which  fixed the vulnerability](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u7-relnotes-1835816.html).

**Update: Aug. 28, 2012**.  Rapid 7 / Metasploit [released their module](http://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/entry/modules/exploits/multi/browser/java_jre17_exec.rb)  and  we get a lot of  questions related to it from people who wish to compare.  See below the original exploit source, to be run from the command line with a security manager enabled, and it will print the contents of the C:\ root directory.

Considering that Rapid 7 posted a working exploit and addition to the exploit packs is imminent ([Attackers Pounce on Zero-Day Java Exploit by Brian Krebs](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/08/attackers-pounce-on-zero-day-java-exploit/)), plus other analysis articles are being published such as [New Java 0day exploited in the wild  -by Alienvault](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/new-java-0day-exploited-in-the-wild/), we decided that witholding details of the exploit will not offer additional protection but only hinder development of protection and signatures.

As we mentioned earlier, we contacted [Michael Schierl,](http://schierlm.users.sourceforge.net/) the Java expert who discovered a number of Java vulnerabilities and asked him to have a look. He sent back his detailed analysis, exploit source, the interim patch with the source code of the patched class.

**Update: Aug. 28, 2012.**

**[CVE-2012-4681](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2012-4681)**

Oracle Java 7 Update 6, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted applet, as exploited in the wild in August 2012 using Gondzz.class and Gondvv.class.

> **Patch request:**

*At this point the patch is by request is not to preserve the code but limit it to IT administrators and developers who can test and decide if they want to deploy. We do not want to push/offer it to 3 billion end java users, it wasn't tested in all the possible scenarios and systems.*
> * Interim patch with the source code of the patched class. See the Readme of the patch in the previous post (thanks to Michael Schierl).
>
> *Email from your company email address to **admin <at> deependresearch.org***

> **Additionally, you can request:**
>
> * Commented and stripped-down version of the exploit source, to be run from the command line with a security manager enabled, and it will print the contents of the C:\ root directory (thanks to Michael Schierl)
>
> * Original 0-day attack HTML page with javascript, Java applet, downloaded Poison Ivy RAT, and pcap.
>
> *Email from your company email address to***admin <at> deependresearch.org***and explain the planned use, please.*

**Analysis**
> The Gondvv class decompiles cleanly, and that contained all the
>
> interesting parts.
>
> The real vulnerability seems to be inside the new Java7 class
>
> com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder,

> <http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/com/sun/beans/finder/ClassFinder.html>

> which seems to make it possible for untrusted code to get access to
>
> classes in restricted packages (i. e. packages that are part of the
>
> security implementation itself and where usually untrusted code cannot
>
> get either access or call it).
>
> At the beginning, the exploit uses that ClassFinder class to get a
>
> reference to the sun.awt.SunToolkit class (sun.\* is a restricted package).

> <http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/sun/awt/SunToolkit.html>

> The rest of the exploit is "only" using that reference to call the
>
> GetField method, which can be used to get access to private fields
>
> (which should not be a problem as the class is in a restricted package),
>
> to get access to a field that stores the permissions for running a
>
> java.beans.Statement.

> <http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/awt/SunToolkit.java.html#301>

> A Statement is created that disables the security manager (by default

**[CLICK HERE TO SEE IF YOU ARE VULNERABLE](http://zulu.zscaler.com/research/java_version.html) (Zscaler)**

The Zscaler tool checks the version of Java used by your browser. If it is below 1.7\_7, you need to update it from Java.com. If it is 1.7\_ 7 already, you are safe (for now). As of Aug 31, 2012, the Zscaler checker prints "vulnerable for 0-day" for a ALL versions above 1.6, they just need to update the tool. In reality, if you have the latest version of Java, you are not vulnerable to this exploit.

In general, you don't need Java plug-ins in browser, best to keep it turned off. You can still use Java desktop apps.

   Is this exploit effective against Icedtea, and other Linux platforms?

   I think, the OpenJDK6 (update 25) is vulnerable too, because it contains the ClassFinder (backported from JDK7)...

   There's no info anywhere whether this works with limited user accounts (not UAC but LUA). If the exploit can not get elevated access, it can not drop anything to system folders. I would have but could not test this, because my employers firewall blocked metasploit. I'll dl it at home and give it a go...

   According to the tester, version 1.7\_07 is also affected.
   Installed it on a test client i got, and ran the test, and got that it's still affected, just a little typo in the tester, or is the 07 also vulnerable?

   How do we use these tests?
   How do we compile them?

   I keep getting

    The problem wasn't really that there was a way of getting a reference to sun.awt.SunToolkit.class. After all, you can get a reference anyway, just by doing

    Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getClass().getSuperclass();

    The real problem was the existence of a public static method getField that creates privileged Field accessor objects and releases them into the wild. Whoever perpetrated that was being incredibly naive. It appears that the method no longer exists.

### Java patched at least 4 bugs

```
The last couple of days there has been a big convulsion on the social networks about the Java zero days found in a Chinese attack campaign on the Internet.
```
```
After some deep analysis of the Jar used in the exploit, [we found out](http://immunityproducts.blogspot.com/2012/08/java-0day-analysis-cve-2012-4681.html) that there were actually two bugs exploited in order to jump outside the Java security sandbox.
```
```
Oracle has just released a new update, Java JDK/JRE 7 update 7 is now
available at
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

```
```
The [release notes](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u7-relnotes-1835816.html) say that this contains fixes for CVE-2012-4681. This seems to be a new move in the recent history of Java updates, since generally it takes months to QA a Java security bug fix - which may be how long this took, considering some researchers claim they sent these vulnerabilities to Oracle months ago.
```
```
While doing some fast analysis (keep in mind we only spent an hour and half on it), we find out that they patched at least 4 vulnerabilities in the Java code base: The two used by the Gondvv worm and two more on difference pieces of code. Just by simply running the [Immunity CANVAS](http://www.immunityinc.com/products-canvas.shtml) exploit that exploits this vulnerability we can see that this update is preventing it.
```
```
When we run the exploit we get the following exception:

java.security.AccessControlException: access denied
("java.lang.RuntimePermission" "accessClassInPackage.sun.awt")
 at
java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(AccessControlContext.java:366)
 at
java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(AccessController.java:555)

 at java.beans.Statement.invokeInternal(Statement.java:213)
 at java.beans.Statement.access$000(Statement.java:58)
 at java.beans.Statement$2.run(Statement.java:185)
 at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)
 at java.beans.Statement.invoke(Statement.java:182)
 at java.beans.Expression.execute(Expression.java:121)
 at Gondvv.GetClass(Gondvv.java:38)
 at Gondvv.SetField(Gondvv.java:46)
 at Gondvv.disableSecurity(Gondvv.java:30)
 at Gondvv.init(Gondvv.java:53)
 at sun.applet.AppletPanel.run(AppletPanel.java:434)
 at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)

There isn't much information in the traceback about the exact changes that this update includes so taking a better look we can see that not only these 2 vulnerabilities used in the Gondvv exploit have been patched, but also some others.
```
```
The two vulnerabilities used in the exploit were located in com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder and com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder

```
```
The update also patched at least another 2 other vulnerabilities that were basically the same but related to Constructors and Fields and allowed an attacker to get any public constructor or any public field via reflection bypassing security checks.
```
```

```
```
These 2 vulnerabilities were located in com.sun.beans.finder.ConstructorFinder and com.sun.beans.finder.FieldFinder and the underlying issue was the same "a trusted immedate caller".

```
```
These two "new" vulnerabilities patched combined with the MethodFinder weakness could allow you to bypass the Sandbox and obtain full execution on Linux, Windows and MacOSX.  Now Oracle has added proper checks by adding calls to methods of sun.reflect.misc.ReflectUtil class.
```
```
Another interesting change this update includes is that public static methods getField and getMethod in sun.awt.SunToolkit were removed which means that the technique used in the exploit to get a private field no longer works.
```
```

```

Hey Mark, Sorry for this unrelated post here. You can delete it after you've read my question; and my question is:
Which wireless hardware did you use in this video http://hak5.org/episodes/haktip-25 ?

I've searched the whole google but couldn't find one with such antenna. I hope you could give me some lead. Thanking you in advance.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-27 12:58:05 UTC  ``` A 0-day flaw exploited in the wild has been reported to affect Java 7:  <http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2012/08/zero-day-season-is-not-over-yet.html> <http://pastie.org/4594319>  This issue was confirmed to allow unsigned applet to bypass Java applet restrictions and run arbitrary code on users' systems.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-27 13:09:03 UTC  ``` Code execution was confirmed with the latest Oracle and IBM Java 7 web browser plugin.  IcedTea-Web using OpenJDK7 blocks this exploit by not allowing applet to change the SecurityManager (which is allowed in Oracle and IBM Java plugin).  Java 6 is currently not known to be affected.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-27 14:11:28 UTC  ``` Secunia: <http://secunia.com/advisories/50133/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-27 15:36:24 UTC  ``` All the info in this bug is now public, see e.g:  <http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Warning-on-critical-Java-hole-1676219.html> <http://www.deependresearch.org/2012/08/java-7-0-day-vulnerability-information.html> <https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2012/08/27/lets-start-the-week-with-a-new-java-0day> <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/52ca1083c22de7022baf7dca8a1756909f803341>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c5)  David Jorm    2012-08-28 01:49:16 UTC  ``` This flaw allows an attacker to circumvent all restrictions applied by the Java security manager. The Java security manager is used to sandbox Java applets in web browsers, but is also used in a variety of other applications. For example, Tomcat can optionally use the Java security manager to apply restrictions to deployed applications. This flaw affects these uses of the Java security manager, not just browser plugins for viewing Java applets.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c9)  David Jorm    2012-08-28 07:37:10 UTC  ``` This statement was last updated on Sep 19, 2012.  Statement:  This flaw allowed an attacker to circumvent all restrictions applied by the Java security manager. The Java security manager is used to sandbox Java applets in web browsers, but is also used in a variety of other applications.  Red Hat has tested the flaw and confirmed that it affected Java SE 7 provided by OpenJDK 7 (java-1.7.0-openjdk), Oracle Java SE 7 (java-1.7.0-oracle) and IBM Java SE 7 (java-1.7.0-ibm) as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Updates correcting this issue were released for all affected packages.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-28 13:13:21 UTC  ``` Details of the flaw from Michael Schierl:  <http://www.deependresearch.org/2012/08/java-7-vulnerability-analysis.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-28 14:22:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=852051#c1)) > IcedTea-Web using OpenJDK7 blocks this exploit by not allowing applet to > change the SecurityManager (which is allowed in Oracle and IBM Java plugin).  Other attacks that do not try to change SecurityManager may be used against IcedTea-Web using OpenJDK7.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Java 0day analysis (CVE-2012-4681)

(This post brought to you by Esteban, Immunity's in-house Java friend)
# Summary

A couple of days ago, a Java 0day was found running like crazy in the wild. While a lot of defense bunnies where asking "WWMAD" (What will my Antivirus do?), we decide to dive into Java for the details of the vulnerability and as we expected, the unpatched vulnerabilities used in the Gondvv exploit were more than one (When we said, "dive deep into Java", we actually meant open our new [Infiltrate 2013 Master Class](http://www.infiltratecon.org/) slide deck which will include a full day of Java auditing).

The first bug was used to get a reference to *sun.awt.SunToolkit*class that is restricted to applets while the second bug invokes the getField public static method on SunToolkit using reflection with a trusted immediate caller bypassing a security check.

The beauty of this bug class is that it provides 100% reliability and is multiplatform. Hence this will shortly become the penetration test Swiss knife for the next couple of years (as did its older brother CVE-2008-5353).

As a final note, the bug was introduced in Java 7.0 released in July 28, 2011. While you are feeling the rush of blood going through your veins while by getting all those shell being pop, think that somewhere not far way (Probably a 10hs flight from some of the major airports in Norte Americana) was enjoying it non-stop for quite some time now.
# Introduction

As the “Secure Coding Guidelines” document [1] states, it is
important to understand how the permissions are checked in the Java
security model. (Please read[guideline 9-1](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/seccodeguide-139067.html)).

Many operations in the JDK perform permission checks before
executing. Whenever a call to
*java.security.AccessController.checkPermission* method
is performed, the complete call stack that exists at that moment is
analyzed.

If any of the callers in the stack do not have the required privileged an exception is raised.

When we are running code in an Applet
in our browser, there is a context that has very restricted
permissions.

This means that if there is any caller
in the stack that is part of our applet, the permission checks will
fail (unless there is a doPrivileged code block, but let's leave that
out for now).

Section “9 – Access Control” in
the “Secure Coding Guidelines” document [1] together with the
“Java Security Architecture” document [2] will give you a
complete insight on how all this works.

## The Gondvv exploit

A PoC for this 0 day exploit
quickly began to spread when Joshua J. Drake posted it on Twitter
<https://twitter.com/jduck1337/status/239875285913317376>.

By analyzing this implementation we can
clearly see how the exploitation is done and where the vulnerabilities are really located.

**The first thing we notice, is that
most of the online analysis talks about one vulnerability where we saw
two 2 vulnerabilities being exploited to achieve full execution on a
target.**

Basically the exploit is creating
an *java.security.AccessControlContext*
instance with a *java.security.ProtectionDomain*
that has full permissions and then replace the actual
AccessControlContext of a *java.beans.Statement*
instance to be able to execute code with full privileges.

So let's take a better look at each
part to understand what is happening under the hood.

In the *java.beans.Statement*
implementation we can see that the AccessControlContext instance is a
private final field and it gets its value by calling
*AccessController.getContext()*.

| **public** **class** Statement {  **private** **static** Object[] *emptyArray* = **new** Object[]{};  **static** ExceptionListener *defaultExceptionListener* = **new** ExceptionListener() { **public** **void** exceptionThrown(Exception e) { System.*err*.println(e); System.*err*.println("Continuing ..."); } };  **private** **final** AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.*getContext*(); **private** **final** Object target; **private** **final** String methodName; **private** **final** Object[] arguments; ClassLoader loader;  [...]  } |
| --- |

That call to the getContext
method will set the AccessControlContext to an applet context that
has restrictions with a limited ProtectionDomain which of course is
not privileged at all.

Back in 2010 Sami Koivu published
information about a Java vulnerability (CVE-2010-0840) that built a
“trusted method chain” [4].

You can see in the article that
the exploitation of that vulnerability also made use of the
*java.beans.Statement* class.

The article also explains that the fix
was to add an AccessControlContext field to the Statement class
setting its value to the applet context when creating an instance
thus avoiding the full trusted chain.

This AccessControllContext field added
in that fix is exactly what this new 0 day exploit is replacing in
order to be able to execute code with full permissions.

**But how can a private field be
changed?**

The trick here is to use the
*sun.awt.SunToolkit* class
which contains a very interesting public static method:

| **public** **static** Field getField(**final** Class klass, **final** String fieldName) { **return** AccessController.*doPrivileged*(**new** PrivilegedAction<Field>() { **public** Field run() { **try** { Field field = klass.getDeclaredField(fieldName); **assert** (field != **null**); field.setAccessible(**true**); **return** field; } **catch** (SecurityException e) { **assert** **false**; } **catch** (NoSuchFieldException e) { **assert** **false**; } **return** **null**; } }); } |
| --- |

We can see that it is using reflection
to get fields and the complete implementation is inside a
doPrivileged block. This *getField* method can be used to get
any field on a class and the good thing is that it can even retrieve
private ones.

Well this is of course very useful,
it's important to notice that the classes that are part of certain
packages are restricted for applets and cannot be accessed or used.
Such packages are:

* com.sun.deploy.\*
* com.sun.imageio.\*
* com.sun.javaws.\*
* com.sun.jnlp.\*
* com.sun.xml.internal.bind.\*
* com.sun.xml.internal.ws.\*
* sun.\*

Trying to instantiate or use classes in
these packages will result in an AccessControlException.

This means that we are not able to get
a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit* class from our applet.

**But t****he basic
thing we need to know is that** **calls
to certain methods** **can potentially bypass the
SecurityManager checks depending on the immediate caller's class
loader.**

**This is explained in detail in the “Secure Coding Guidelines”
document by Sun [1] in guidelines 9-8 and 9-9.**

**This exploit is abusing this situation taking advantage of the
immediate caller to bypass security checks.**

## Vulnerabilities

**There
are 2 different zero-day vulnerabilities used in this exploit**:
one is used to obtain a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit*class
and the other is used to invoke the public *getField*
method on that class.

The exploit is
making use of the *java.beans.Expression* which is a
*java.beans.Statement* subclass.
There are 2
*Expression* instances that are used to trigger these 2
different bugs.

When the
*Expression.execute* method is called it ends up calling
*Statement.invokeInternal* method, so let's check the
implementation:

| **private** Object invokeInternal() **throws** Exception { Object target = getTarget(); String methodName = getMethodName();  **if** (target == **null** || methodName == **null**) { **throw** **new** NullPointerException((target == **null** ? "target" : "methodName") + " should not be null"); }  Object[] arguments = getArguments(); **if** (arguments == **null**) { arguments = *emptyArray*; } // Class.forName() won't load classes outside // of core from a class inside core. Special // case this method. **if** (target == Class.**class** && methodName.equals("forName")) { **return** ClassFinder.*resolveClass*((String)arguments[0], **this**.loader); } Class[] argClasses = **new** Class[arguments.length]; **for**(**int** i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) { argClasses[i] = (arguments[i] == **null**) ? **null** : arguments[i].getClass(); }  AccessibleObject m = **null**; **if** (target **instanceof** Class) { /\* For class methods, simluate the effect of a meta class by taking the union of the static methods of the actual class, with the instance methods of "Class.class" and the overloaded "newInstance" methods defined by the constructors. This way "System.class", for example, will perform both the static method getProperties() and the instance method getSuperclass() defined in "Class.class". \*/ **if** (methodName.equals("new")) { methodName = "newInstance"; } // Provide a short form for array instantiation by faking an nary-constructor. **if** (methodName.equals("newInstance") && ((Class)target).isArray()) { Object result = Array.*newInstance*(((Class)target).getComponentType(), arguments.length); **for**(**int** i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) { Array.*set*(result, i, arguments[i]); } **return** result; } **if** (methodName.equals("newInstance") && arguments.length != 0) { // The Character class, as of 1.4, does not have a constructor // which takes a String. All of the other "wrapper" classes // for Java's primitive types have a String constructor so we // fake such a constructor here so that this special case can be // ignored elsewhere. **if** (target == Character.**class** && arguments.length == 1 && argClasses[0] == String.**class**) { **return** **new** Character(((String)arguments[0]).charAt(0)); } **try** { m = ConstructorFinder.*findConstructor*((Class)target, argClasses); } **catch** (NoSuchMethodException exception) { m = **null**; } } **if** (m == **null** && target != Class.**class**) {  m = *getMethod*((Class)target, methodName, argClasses); } **if** (m == **null**) { m = *getMethod*(Class.**class**, methodName, argClasses); } } **else** { /\* This special casing of arrays is not necessary, but makes files involving arrays much shorter and simplifies the archiving infrastrcure. The Array.set() method introduces an unusual idea - that of a static method changing the state of an instance. Normally statements with side effects on objects are instance methods of the objects themselves and we reinstate this rule (perhaps temporarily) by special-casing arrays. \*/ **if** (target.getClass().isArray() && (methodName.equals("set") || methodName.equals("get"))) { **int** index = ((Integer)arguments[0]).intValue(); **if** (methodName.equals("get")) { **return** Array.*get*(target, index); } **else** { Array.*set*(target, index, arguments[1]); **return** **null**; } } m = *getMethod*(target.getClass(), methodName, argClasses); } **if** (m != **null**) { **try** { **if** (m **instanceof** Method) { **return** MethodUtil.*invoke*((Method)m, target, arguments); } **else** { **return** ((Constructor)m).newInstance(arguments); } } **catch** (IllegalAccessException iae) { **throw** **new** Exception("Statement cannot invoke: " + methodName + " on " + target.getClass(), iae); } **catch** (InvocationTargetException ite) { Throwable te = ite.getTargetException(); **if** (te **instanceof** Exception) { **throw** (Exception)te; } **else** { **throw** ite; } } } **throw** **new** NoSuchMethodException(toString());  } |
| --- |

And the *Statement.getMethod* implementation is:

| **static** Method getMethod(Class<?> type, String name, Class<?>... args) { **try** { **return** MethodFinder.*findMethod*(type, name, args); } **catch** (NoSuchMethodException exception) { **return** **null**; }  } |
| --- |

Highlighted in the code you'll see the calls to
*com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.resolveClass* and
*com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder.findMethod* methods.

## com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.findClass vulnerability

The *Statement.invokeInternal* method
is calling *com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.resolveClass*and if we take a look a its
implementation we'll see that it ends up calling the
*com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.findClass* method:

| **public** **static** Class<?> resolveClass(String name, ClassLoader loader) **throws** ClassNotFoundException { Class<?> type = PrimitiveTypeMap.*getType*(name); **return** (type == **null**) ? *findClass*(name, loader): type; } |
| --- |

| **public** **static** Class<?> findClass(String name) **throws** ClassNotFoundException { **try** { ClassLoader loader = Thread.*currentThread*().getContextClassLoader(); **if** (loader == **null**) { loader = ClassLoader.*getSystemClassLoader*(); } **if** (loader != **null**) { **return** Class.*forName*(name, **false**, loader); } } **catch** (ClassNotFoundException exception) { // use current class loader instead } **catch** (SecurityException exception) { // use current class loader instead } **return** Class.*forName*(name); } |
| --- |

This code shows that if an exception is
captured, then the default is to simply call Class.forName and this
is exaclty what happens here.

As it is explained in the Guideline
9-9: “Safely invoke standard APIs that perform tasks using the
immediate caller's class loader instance” on the “Secure Code
Guidelines” documentation [1], a call to *Class.forName* will
use the immediate caller ClassLoader and in this case the caller is
part of the JDK which is trusted thus allowing us to get any class on
any package.

The caller's stack can be seen by simply
debugging the applet:

## MethodFinder.findMethod vulnerability

According to the “Secure Code Guidelines” document in
guideline 9.8 the *java.lang.Class.getMethod* and
*java.lang.Class.getMethods* only
take the immediate caller into account when performing security
checks.

These methods can
be used to get a Method reference via reflection but only “public”
ones.

Even though we
have a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit* class we cannot
call any of its methods directly because is part of a restricted
package and a security exception will be raised.

What is needed
here is a way of getting a method reference via reflection but having
a “trusted” immediate caller in the stack in order to bypass
security checks.

The implementation
of *com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder.findMethod* is this:

| **public** **static** Method findMethod(Class<?> type, String name, Class<?>...args) **throws** NoSuchMethodException {  **if** (name == **null**) {  **throw** **new** IllegalArgumentException("Method name is not set  } PrimitiveWrapperMap.*replacePrimitivesWithWrappers*(args);  Signature signature = **new** Signature(type, name, args);   Method method = *CACHE*.get(signature);  **if** (method != **null**) {  **return** method;  }  method = *findAccessibleMethod*(**new** MethodFinder(name, args).find(type.getMethods())); *CACHE*.put(signature, method);  **return** method; } |
| --- |

The call to *findAccessibleMethod* ends up calling
*java.lang.Class.getMethods* and the immediate caller in the
stack is *com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder* which is trusted
since is part of the JDK thus bypassing the security checks.

Once again we can see the callers stack by debugging the applet:

## Affected Versions

The com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder and
com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder classes are available only since JDK
7.
## Putting all together

So this exploit is performing the following steps:

* Creates a Statement instance that will call
  System.setSecurityManager(null) method using reflection.
* Creates a custom AccessControlContext with full permissions.
* With one bug it gets a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit*class that is restricted to
  applets.
* With the other bug it
  invokes the *getField*
  public static method on *sun.awt.SunToolkit*
  using reflection with a trusted immediate caller that bypasses the
  security checks.
* With the *getField*
  method it is getting a reference to *Statement.acc*
  private field and setting its value to the custom
  AccessControlContext instance previously created.
* Finally it executes the Statement
  that will disable the Security Manager bypassing all security checks
  because it has full permissions set in its AccessControlContext.

Well done finding the second vulnerability. To be honest, I stopped when finding the first one too, without thinking about how the method is actually invoked later.

BTW CVE-2012-4681 will coexist next to CVE-2012-1723, which is able to exploit any versions from 1.4 to 7 published last year or earlier, not only Java 7, and especially every publicly available 1.4 or 5 version ever published :)

Interesting the CVE speaks only about 1.7 having the vuln "and possibly others" have you tested 1.4-1.7?

I was wondering how is it possible to modify Statement.acc even though it has modifier final. It seems that the field.setAccessible(true) call in getField is enough to allow the modification of a final field.

i can also get sun.xxx like this:
"
Object t[] = new Object[1];
t[0]= Class.forName(paramString);
return (Class)t[0];

Looks like the fix in 1.7\_07 was to add explicit calls to ReflectUtil.checkPackageAccess() at the beginning of the two com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder findClass() variants.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Alert
# Oracle Java 7 Security Manager Bypass Vulnerability

Last RevisedJanuary 23, 2013
Alert CodeTA12-240A

### Systems Affected

Any system using Oracle Java 7 (1.7, 1.7.0) including

* Java Platform Standard Edition 7 (Java SE 7)
* Java SE Development Kit (JDK 7)
* Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE 7)
* OpenJDK 7 and 7u

IcedTea 2.3.0 (based on OpenJDK 7) is also affected.

Web browsers using the Java 7 plug-in are at high risk.

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Java 7 restricts the permissions of Java applets could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system.

A vulnerability in the Java Security Manager allows a Java applet to grant itself permission to execute arbitrary code. An attacker could use social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit a link to a website hosting a malicious applet.

Any web browser using the Java 7 plug-in is affected. The Java Deployment Toolkit plug-in and Java Web Start can also be used as attack vectors.

Reports indicate this vulnerability is being actively exploited, and exploit code is publicly available.

Further technical details are available in Vulnerability Note [VU#636312](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312).

### Impact

By convincing a user to load a malicious Java applet or Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Java plug-in process.

### Solution

**Update Java**

This and other vulnerabilities are addressed by Java 7 [Update 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u7-relnotes-1835816.html). Please see [Oracle Security Alert for CVE-2012-4681](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2012-4681-1835715.html) for more information.

This vulnerability is addressed in [IcedTea 2.3.1](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/distro-pkg-dev/2012-August/020083.html).

[Reports](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/388) indicate that other vulnerabilities remain after updating Java to Update 7.

**Disable the Java plug-in, Java Deployment Toolkit, and Java Web Start functionality**

To protect against this and future vulnerabilities, consider disabling the Java plug-in, Java Deployment Toolkit, and Java Web Start functionality. There are multiple ways to invoke Java in different web browsers and operating systems, and it can be difficult to completely disable browser support for Java. Check the [Solution](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#solution) section of VU#636312 for up-to-date information.

Here are instructions for several common web browsers. Take care to disable both the Java and Java Deployment Toolkit plug-ins and, if necessary, disable Java Web Start by breaking JNLP handling.

* Apple Safari: [How to disable the Java web plug-in in Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT5241), [disable "Open 'safe' files after downloading"](/reading_room/securing_browser/#Safari)
* Mozilla Firefox: [How to turn off Java applets](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/How%20to%20turn%20off%20Java%20applets)
* Google Chrome: See the "Disable specific plug-ins" section of the Chrome [plug-ins](https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=142064) documentation.
* Microsoft Internet Explorer: Disabling Java in Internet Explorer is significantly more complicated than with other browsers. Please see the [instructions](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/636312#disable_java_in_IE) in VU#636312.

**Downgrade to Java 6**

Consider uninstalling Java 7 and using Java 6.

**Use NoScript**

[NoScript](http://noscript.net/) is a browser extension for Mozilla Firefox browsers that provides options to block Java applets.

# How to turn off Java applets

(Redirected from [How to turn off Java applets Redirect 1](/en-US/kb/How%20to%20turn%20off%20Java%20applets?redirect=no))

This article is no longer maintained, so its content might be out of date.

Support ended for all [NPAPI plugins](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI#Plugins), except for Adobe Flash, in [Firefox version](/en-US/kb/find-what-version-firefox-you-are-using) 52. See [this article](/en-US/kb/npapi-plugins) for details.

This article explains how to disable the Java plugin in Firefox so that Java applets no longer run.

By default, Firefox prompts you to activate Java when you visit websites with Java content. However, you may decide that you do not want Java applets to run. To disable Java applets in Firefox:

1. Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif), click Add-ons and themes and select Plugins.
2. Click on the **Java(TM) Platform** plugin **Java Applet Plug-in****Java** plugin to select it.
3. Select Never Activate in its drop-down menu if it's not already set.

Java applets will no longer be permitted to launch in Firefox and you will no longer be prompted to activate Java.

### [Recent kernel memory disclosure bugs in CANVAS](https://immunityproducts.blogspot.com/2018/11/recent-kernel-memory-disclosure-bugs-in.html)

In July 2017, a [blogpost](https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/) from Anders Fogh introduced the idea of leaking kernel memory from the unprivileged userland. This was later followed by the [public introduction](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html) of both [Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_%28security_vulnerability) and [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_%28security_vulnerability) and their corresponding coverage in the media. For Immunity this was the perfect opportunity to not only write two Spectre exploits for CANVAS (the Windows version being [CEU only](https://www.immunitysec.com/partners/ceu-index.html)) but also a framework dedicated to this vulnerability class. In particular we also wrote CANVAS exploits for [CVE-2017-18344](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-18344) and [CVE-2018-14656](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-14656) . Some of our exploitation notes have been published on the Immunity website:

Part 1: <https://www.immunityinc.com/downloads/Kernel-Memory-Disclosure-and-Canvas_Part_1.pdf>

Part 2: <https://www.immunityinc.com/downloads/Kernel-Memory-Disclosure-and-Canvas_Part_2.pdf>

# A few notes about the exploitation of  CVE-2017-3623 (aka EBBISLAND) on Solaris 10 (x86/amd64)

The advisory CVE-2017-3623 [**CVE**] is associated with the infamous EBBISLAND exploit that was leaked as part of the Equation Group collection [**EQGROUP**]. The corresponding heap overflow vulnerability can be exploited to provide a remote root shell to the attacker. What makes it especially interesting is that:

### Java 0day analysis (CVE-2012-4681)

(This post brought to you by Esteban, Immunity's in-house Java friend)
# Summary

A couple of days ago, a Java 0day was found running like crazy in the wild. While a lot of defense bunnies where asking "WWMAD" (What will my Antivirus do?), we decide to dive into Java for the details of the vulnerability and as we expected, the unpatched vulnerabilities used in the Gondvv exploit were more than one (When we said, "dive deep into Java", we actually meant open our new [Infiltrate 2013 Master Class](http://www.infiltratecon.org/) slide deck which will include a full day of Java auditing).

The first bug was used to get a reference to *sun.awt.SunToolkit*class that is restricted to applets while the second bug invokes the getField public static method on SunToolkit using reflection with a trusted immediate caller bypassing a security check.

The beauty of this bug class is that it provides 100% reliability and is multiplatform. Hence this will shortly become the penetration test Swiss knife for the next couple of years (as did its older brother CVE-2008-5353).

As a final note, the bug was introduced in Java 7.0 released in July 28, 2011. While you are feeling the rush of blood going through your veins while by getting all those shell being pop, think that somewhere not far way (Probably a 10hs flight from some of the major airports in Norte Americana) was enjoying it non-stop for quite some time now.
# Introduction

As the “Secure Coding Guidelines” document [1] states, it is
important to understand how the permissions are checked in the Java
security model. (Please read[guideline 9-1](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/seccodeguide-139067.html)).

Many operations in the JDK perform permission checks before
executing. Whenever a call to
*java.security.AccessController.checkPermission* method
is performed, the complete call stack that exists at that moment is
analyzed.

If any of the callers in the stack do not have the required privileged an exception is raised.

When we are running code in an Applet
in our browser, there is a context that has very restricted
permissions.

This means that if there is any caller
in the stack that is part of our applet, the permission checks will
fail (unless there is a doPrivileged code block, but let's leave that
out for now).

Section “9 – Access Control” in
the “Secure Coding Guidelines” document [1] together with the
“Java Security Architecture” document [2] will give you a
complete insight on how all this works.

## The Gondvv exploit

A PoC for this 0 day exploit
quickly began to spread when Joshua J. Drake posted it on Twitter
<https://twitter.com/jduck1337/status/239875285913317376>.

By analyzing this implementation we can
clearly see how the exploitation is done and where the vulnerabilities are really located.

**The first thing we notice, is that
most of the online analysis talks about one vulnerability where we saw
two 2 vulnerabilities being exploited to achieve full execution on a
target.**

Basically the exploit is creating
an *java.security.AccessControlContext*
instance with a *java.security.ProtectionDomain*
that has full permissions and then replace the actual
AccessControlContext of a *java.beans.Statement*
instance to be able to execute code with full privileges.

So let's take a better look at each
part to understand what is happening under the hood.

In the *java.beans.Statement*
implementation we can see that the AccessControlContext instance is a
private final field and it gets its value by calling
*AccessController.getContext()*.

| **public** **class** Statement {  **private** **static** Object[] *emptyArray* = **new** Object[]{};  **static** ExceptionListener *defaultExceptionListener* = **new** ExceptionListener() { **public** **void** exceptionThrown(Exception e) { System.*err*.println(e); System.*err*.println("Continuing ..."); } };  **private** **final** AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.*getContext*(); **private** **final** Object target; **private** **final** String methodName; **private** **final** Object[] arguments; ClassLoader loader;  [...]  } |
| --- |

That call to the getContext
method will set the AccessControlContext to an applet context that
has restrictions with a limited ProtectionDomain which of course is
not privileged at all.

Back in 2010 Sami Koivu published
information about a Java vulnerability (CVE-2010-0840) that built a
“trusted method chain” [4].

You can see in the article that
the exploitation of that vulnerability also made use of the
*java.beans.Statement* class.

The article also explains that the fix
was to add an AccessControlContext field to the Statement class
setting its value to the applet context when creating an instance
thus avoiding the full trusted chain.

This AccessControllContext field added
in that fix is exactly what this new 0 day exploit is replacing in
order to be able to execute code with full permissions.

**But how can a private field be
changed?**

The trick here is to use the
*sun.awt.SunToolkit* class
which contains a very interesting public static method:

| **public** **static** Field getField(**final** Class klass, **final** String fieldName) { **return** AccessController.*doPrivileged*(**new** PrivilegedAction<Field>() { **public** Field run() { **try** { Field field = klass.getDeclaredField(fieldName); **assert** (field != **null**); field.setAccessible(**true**); **return** field; } **catch** (SecurityException e) { **assert** **false**; } **catch** (NoSuchFieldException e) { **assert** **false**; } **return** **null**; } }); } |
| --- |

We can see that it is using reflection
to get fields and the complete implementation is inside a
doPrivileged block. This *getField* method can be used to get
any field on a class and the good thing is that it can even retrieve
private ones.

Well this is of course very useful,
it's important to notice that the classes that are part of certain
packages are restricted for applets and cannot be accessed or used.
Such packages are:

* com.sun.deploy.\*
* com.sun.imageio.\*
* com.sun.javaws.\*
* com.sun.jnlp.\*
* com.sun.xml.internal.bind.\*
* com.sun.xml.internal.ws.\*
* sun.\*

Trying to instantiate or use classes in
these packages will result in an AccessControlException.

This means that we are not able to get
a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit* class from our applet.

**But t****he basic
thing we need to know is that** **calls
to certain methods** **can potentially bypass the
SecurityManager checks depending on the immediate caller's class
loader.**

**This is explained in detail in the “Secure Coding Guidelines”
document by Sun [1] in guidelines 9-8 and 9-9.**

**This exploit is abusing this situation taking advantage of the
immediate caller to bypass security checks.**

## Vulnerabilities

**There
are 2 different zero-day vulnerabilities used in this exploit**:
one is used to obtain a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit*class
and the other is used to invoke the public *getField*
method on that class.

The exploit is
making use of the *java.beans.Expression* which is a
*java.beans.Statement* subclass.
There are 2
*Expression* instances that are used to trigger these 2
different bugs.

When the
*Expression.execute* method is called it ends up calling
*Statement.invokeInternal* method, so let's check the
implementation:

| **private** Object invokeInternal() **throws** Exception { Object target = getTarget(); String methodName = getMethodName();  **if** (target == **null** || methodName == **null**) { **throw** **new** NullPointerException((target == **null** ? "target" : "methodName") + " should not be null"); }  Object[] arguments = getArguments(); **if** (arguments == **null**) { arguments = *emptyArray*; } // Class.forName() won't load classes outside // of core from a class inside core. Special // case this method. **if** (target == Class.**class** && methodName.equals("forName")) { **return** ClassFinder.*resolveClass*((String)arguments[0], **this**.loader); } Class[] argClasses = **new** Class[arguments.length]; **for**(**int** i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) { argClasses[i] = (arguments[i] == **null**) ? **null** : arguments[i].getClass(); }  AccessibleObject m = **null**; **if** (target **instanceof** Class) { /\* For class methods, simluate the effect of a meta class by taking the union of the static methods of the actual class, with the instance methods of "Class.class" and the overloaded "newInstance" methods defined by the constructors. This way "System.class", for example, will perform both the static method getProperties() and the instance method getSuperclass() defined in "Class.class". \*/ **if** (methodName.equals("new")) { methodName = "newInstance"; } // Provide a short form for array instantiation by faking an nary-constructor. **if** (methodName.equals("newInstance") && ((Class)target).isArray()) { Object result = Array.*newInstance*(((Class)target).getComponentType(), arguments.length); **for**(**int** i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) { Array.*set*(result, i, arguments[i]); } **return** result; } **if** (methodName.equals("newInstance") && arguments.length != 0) { // The Character class, as of 1.4, does not have a constructor // which takes a String. All of the other "wrapper" classes // for Java's primitive types have a String constructor so we // fake such a constructor here so that this special case can be // ignored elsewhere. **if** (target == Character.**class** && arguments.length == 1 && argClasses[0] == String.**class**) { **return** **new** Character(((String)arguments[0]).charAt(0)); } **try** { m = ConstructorFinder.*findConstructor*((Class)target, argClasses); } **catch** (NoSuchMethodException exception) { m = **null**; } } **if** (m == **null** && target != Class.**class**) {  m = *getMethod*((Class)target, methodName, argClasses); } **if** (m == **null**) { m = *getMethod*(Class.**class**, methodName, argClasses); } } **else** { /\* This special casing of arrays is not necessary, but makes files involving arrays much shorter and simplifies the archiving infrastrcure. The Array.set() method introduces an unusual idea - that of a static method changing the state of an instance. Normally statements with side effects on objects are instance methods of the objects themselves and we reinstate this rule (perhaps temporarily) by special-casing arrays. \*/ **if** (target.getClass().isArray() && (methodName.equals("set") || methodName.equals("get"))) { **int** index = ((Integer)arguments[0]).intValue(); **if** (methodName.equals("get")) { **return** Array.*get*(target, index); } **else** { Array.*set*(target, index, arguments[1]); **return** **null**; } } m = *getMethod*(target.getClass(), methodName, argClasses); } **if** (m != **null**) { **try** { **if** (m **instanceof** Method) { **return** MethodUtil.*invoke*((Method)m, target, arguments); } **else** { **return** ((Constructor)m).newInstance(arguments); } } **catch** (IllegalAccessException iae) { **throw** **new** Exception("Statement cannot invoke: " + methodName + " on " + target.getClass(), iae); } **catch** (InvocationTargetException ite) { Throwable te = ite.getTargetException(); **if** (te **instanceof** Exception) { **throw** (Exception)te; } **else** { **throw** ite; } } } **throw** **new** NoSuchMethodException(toString());  } |
| --- |

And the *Statement.getMethod* implementation is:

| **static** Method getMethod(Class<?> type, String name, Class<?>... args) { **try** { **return** MethodFinder.*findMethod*(type, name, args); } **catch** (NoSuchMethodException exception) { **return** **null**; }  } |
| --- |

Highlighted in the code you'll see the calls to
*com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.resolveClass* and
*com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder.findMethod* methods.

## com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.findClass vulnerability

The *Statement.invokeInternal* method
is calling *com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.resolveClass*and if we take a look a its
implementation we'll see that it ends up calling the
*com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder.findClass* method:

| **public** **static** Class<?> resolveClass(String name, ClassLoader loader) **throws** ClassNotFoundException { Class<?> type = PrimitiveTypeMap.*getType*(name); **return** (type == **null**) ? *findClass*(name, loader): type; } |
| --- |

| **public** **static** Class<?> findClass(String name) **throws** ClassNotFoundException { **try** { ClassLoader loader = Thread.*currentThread*().getContextClassLoader(); **if** (loader == **null**) { loader = ClassLoader.*getSystemClassLoader*(); } **if** (loader != **null**) { **return** Class.*forName*(name, **false**, loader); } } **catch** (ClassNotFoundException exception) { // use current class loader instead } **catch** (SecurityException exception) { // use current class loader instead } **return** Class.*forName*(name); } |
| --- |

This code shows that if an exception is
captured, then the default is to simply call Class.forName and this
is exaclty what happens here.

As it is explained in the Guideline
9-9: “Safely invoke standard APIs that perform tasks using the
immediate caller's class loader instance” on the “Secure Code
Guidelines” documentation [1], a call to *Class.forName* will
use the immediate caller ClassLoader and in this case the caller is
part of the JDK which is trusted thus allowing us to get any class on
any package.

The caller's stack can be seen by simply
debugging the applet:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbCl90jRhN0aK1RrWlheYIoMSaSWLZE-eaP3lyXGxcBn2rX3jde9LGXBxm8nd5OTu8zeHB7R2zDz61QmfIQ03oM7pYDdK9yr51gm7LMWiaM2k5iRupmDbjfGoN34OxaV4KBalK5xnX9L4r/s320/1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbCl90jRhN0aK1RrWlheYIoMSaSWLZE-eaP3lyXGxcBn2rX3jde9LGXBxm8nd5OTu8zeHB7R2zDz61QmfIQ03oM7pYDdK9yr51gm7LMWiaM2k5iRupmDbjfGoN34OxaV4KBalK5xnX9L4r/s1600/1.png)

## MethodFinder.findMethod vulnerability

According to the “Secure Code Guidelines” document in
guideline 9.8 the *java.lang.Class.getMethod* and
*java.lang.Class.getMethods* only
take the immediate caller into account when performing security
checks.

These methods can
be used to get a Method reference via reflection but only “public”
ones.

Even though we
have a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit* class we cannot
call any of its methods directly because is part of a restricted
package and a security exception will be raised.

What is needed
here is a way of getting a method reference via reflection but having
a “trusted” immediate caller in the stack in order to bypass
security checks.

The implementation
of *com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder.findMethod* is this:

| **public** **static** Method findMethod(Class<?> type, String name, Class<?>...args) **throws** NoSuchMethodException {  **if** (name == **null**) {  **throw** **new** IllegalArgumentException("Method name is not set  } PrimitiveWrapperMap.*replacePrimitivesWithWrappers*(args);  Signature signature = **new** Signature(type, name, args);   Method method = *CACHE*.get(signature);  **if** (method != **null**) {  **return** method;  }  method = *findAccessibleMethod*(**new** MethodFinder(name, args).find(type.getMethods())); *CACHE*.put(signature, method);  **return** method; } |
| --- |

The call to *findAccessibleMethod* ends up calling
*java.lang.Class.getMethods* and the immediate caller in the
stack is *com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder* which is trusted
since is part of the JDK thus bypassing the security checks.

Once again we can see the callers stack by debugging the applet:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifwA92wi91t4BsV_0rfTxM89iBpief83rYWG73Qab6GB_gjiUQnUv5Hww7q9W4tJe6etvx_KZlQDKGSCuJDs0be4P0kvw6RhN5eKJYFbWtTln23lUcYqChyrDsyfChHG8Wd6d5x98wpUPo/s320/2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifwA92wi91t4BsV_0rfTxM89iBpief83rYWG73Qab6GB_gjiUQnUv5Hww7q9W4tJe6etvx_KZlQDKGSCuJDs0be4P0kvw6RhN5eKJYFbWtTln23lUcYqChyrDsyfChHG8Wd6d5x98wpUPo/s1600/2.png)

## Affected Versions

The com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder and
com.sun.beans.finder.ClassFinder classes are available only since JDK
7.
## Putting all together

So this exploit is performing the following steps:

* Creates a Statement instance that will call
  System.setSecurityManager(null) method using reflection.
* Creates a custom AccessControlContext with full permissions.
* With one bug it gets a reference to the *sun.awt.SunToolkit*class that is restricted to
  applets.
* With the other bug it
  invokes the *getField*
  public static method on *sun.awt.SunToolkit*
  using reflection with a trusted immediate caller that bypasses the
  security checks.
* With the *getField*
  method it is getting a reference to *Statement.acc*
  private field and setting its value to the custom
  AccessControlContext instance previously created.
* Finally it executes the Statement
  that will disable the Security Manager bypassing all security checks
  because it has full permissions set in its AccessControlContext.

Well done finding the second vulnerability. To be honest, I stopped when finding the first one too, without thinking about how the method is actually invoked later.

BTW CVE-2012-4681 will coexist next to CVE-2012-1723, which is able to exploit any versions from 1.4 to 7 published last year or earlier, not only Java 7, and especially every publicly available 1.4 or 5 version ever published :)

Interesting the CVE speaks only about 1.7 having the vuln "and possibly others" have you tested 1.4-1.7?

I was wondering how is it possible to modify Statement.acc even though it has modifier final. It seems that the field.setAccessible(true) call in getField is enough to allow the modification of a final field.

i can also get sun.xxx like this:
"
Object t[] = new Object[1];
t[0]= Class.forName(paramString);
