How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  ## vBulletin 3.x MAPI Plugin 1.4.3 released with security patch - 04/23/2012

  Mon 23 Apr '12, 4:29pm

  To support the upcoming release of vBulletin Mobile Suite 1.3, which contains vBulletin's iOS Mobile App 1.3 and Android Mobile App 1.3, we have released vBulletin 3.x MAPI Plugin 1.4.3. This release contains [nine changes](http://tracker.vbulletin.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+VBM+AND+fixVersion+%3D+%221.4.3%22+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC%2C+key+DESC) **required** to fix existing mobile app issues on forums running vBulletin 3. A security patch has been included to improve the security of the vBulletin 3.x MAPI plugin as the result of a recent internal security review. Although no exploits have been reported, we urge our customers to **upgrade as soon as possible**.

  vBulletin 3 customers should not upgrade unless they have the [vBulletin Mobile Suite](https://www.vbulletin.com/order/index.php?do=step1).

  vBulletin 3.x MAPI Plugin 1.4.3 is compatible with vBulletin 3.7.5+. vBulletin Blogs customers must have [Blogs 2.0.4](https://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php/395802-vBulletin-Blogs-2-0-4-has-been-released) installed before upgrading to 3.x MAPI Plugin 1.4.3. Please visit your [vBulletin Members Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/) to download it.

  The following additional steps need to be taken after upgrade to vBulletin 3.x MAPI Plugin 1.4.3.
  1. Download the "API-Log-Clean.xml" attached to this thread. (Included in the do\_not\_upload folder for full installs.)
  2. Import "API-Log-Clean.xml" using the "Manage Products" interface in the "Plugins & Products" section of your Admin CP. The cleanup script will run on install. AdminCP -> Plugins & Products -> Manage Products -> Add/Import Product
  3. Delete "API-Log-Clean" using the "Product Manager" option in the "Plugins & Products" section of your Admin CP. *(Optional. The product is automatically disabled after the script runs.)*

  ## vBulletin Security Patch for vBulletin 4.1.2 - 4.1.11 for Suite & Forum - 04/23/2012

  Mon 23 Apr '12, 4:31pm

  vBulletin has released a security patch to improve the security of the vBulletin 4 MAPI (**4.1.2 - 4.1.11 Suite & Forum**) as the result of a recent internal security review. Although no exploits have been reported, we urge our customers to upgrade as soon as possible.

  The changes **do not affect** vBulletin 4.0.0 - 4.1.1.

  This patch has been issued for **vBulletin 4.1.2 through 4.1.11**. A separate PL1 has been issued for vBulletin 4.1.12.

  These MAPI security improvements have been added for vBulletin 3.x with the release of 3.x MAPI 1.4.3.

  To improve the security of your vBulletin 4 installation, please download the patch from the members area of vBulletin: <http://members.vbulletin.com/>

  The upgrade process requires a few additional steps for this patch level release.
  1. Download PL1 for the version of vBulletin you're currently running from [[https://members.vbulletin.com](https://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php)](https://members.vbulletin.com/)[/patches.php](https://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php).
  2. Extract the vBulletin patch files from the zip file.
  3. Upload the patch files to your server, overwriting the old files.
  4. Download the "API-Log-Clean.xml" attached to this thread. *(Included in the do\_not\_upload folder for full installs.)*
  5. Import "API-Log-Clean.xml" using the "Manage Products" interface in the "Plugins & Products" section of your Admin CP. The cleanup script will run on install. *(This is only required if you have logging turned on for MAPI.)*

     AdminCP -> Plugins & Products -> Manage Products -> Add/Import Product
  6. Delete "API-Log-Clean" using the "Product Manager" option in the "Plugins & Products" section of your Admin CP. *(Optional. The product is automatically disabled after the script runs.)*

  **Advanced Users** - Files updated in the patch are:
  + includes/init.php

  Please note that this issue and fix affects **BOTH** vBulletin 4 **SUITE** and **FORUM**.

  ## vBulletin Security Patch for vBulletin 4.1.12 for Suite & Forum - 04/23/2012

  Mon 23 Apr '12, 4:32pm

  vBulletin has released a security patch to improve the security of the vBulletin 4 MAPI for 4.1.12 Suite & Forum as the result of a recent internal security review. Although no exploits have been reported, we urge our customers to upgrade as soon as possible.

  The changes **do not affect** vBulletin 4.0.0 - 4.1.1.

  This patch has been issued for **vBulletin 4.1.12**. A separate set of patches have been issued for vBulletin 4.1.2 - 4.1.11.

  The MAPI security improvements have been added for vBulletin 3.x with the release of 3.x MAPI 1.4.3.

  To improve the security of your vBulletin 4 installation, please download the patch from the members area of vBulletin: <http://members.vbulletin.com/>

  In addition to the security improvements, we've resolved the following 4.1.12 issues.

  + [VBIV-14663](http://tracker.vbulletin.com/browse/VBIV-14663) - Quoting doesn't work in the mobile style
  + [VBIV-14660](http://tracker.vbulletin.com/browse/VBIV-14660) - Static HTML in CMS always displays all content
  + [VBIV-14754](http://tracker.vbulletin.com/browse/VBIV-14754) - unset($VB\_API\_PARAMS\_TO\_VERIFY['vbseourl']) to match vB3 MAPI change.
  + [VBIV-14681](http://tracker.vbulletin.com/browse/VBIV-14681) - HTML is stripped from article previews
  + [VBIV-14667](http://tracker.vbulletin.com/browse/VBIV-14667) - Category pages do not load if using basic/advanced friendly URLs

  The upgrade process requires a few additional steps for this patch level release.
  1. Download PL1 for vBulletin 4.1.12 from [https://members.vbulletin.com](https://members.vbulletin.com/).
  2. Extract the vBulletin patch files from the zip file.
  3. Upload the patch files to your server, overwriting the old files.
  4. Run yourdomain.com/forumfolder/install/upgrade.php. **(Required for 4.1.12.)**
  5. Download the "API-Log-Clean.xml" attached to this thread. *(Included in the do\_not\_upload folder for full installs.)*
  6. Import "API-Log-Clean.xml" using the "Manage Products" interface in the "Plugins & Products" section of your Admin CP. The cleanup script will run on install. *(This is only required if you have logging turned on for MAPI.)*

     AdminCP -> Plugins & Products -> Manage Products -> Add/Import Product
  7. Delete "API-Log-Clean" using the "Product Manager" option in the "Plugins & Products" section of your Admin CP. *(Optional. The product is automatically disabled after the script runs.)*

  **Advanced Users** - Files updated in the patch are:
  + /api.php
  + /forumrunner/push.php
  + /includes/class\_friendly\_url.php
  + /includes/init.php
  + /install/vbulletin-mobile-style-blog.xml

  Please note that if you choose to just patch v4.1.12 rather than upload the full package then you will get a file contents warning related to the 11 patched files when you run the upgrader.

  Code:
  ```
  Due to the following errors, the install/upgrade can not continue:

      Following is a list of files that are either missing or contain unexpected contents. The most likely cause is that all of the files from this release have not been properly uploaded. You should resolve this error before continuing.
      /api.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /forumrunner/push.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /includes/class_friendly_url.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /includes/init.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /install/vbulletin-mobile-style-blog.xml - File does not contain expected contents
      /install/vbulletin-mobile-style.xml - File does not contain expected contents
      /packages/vbcms/content/phpeval.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /packages/vbcms/content/staticpage.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /packages/vbcms/item/content/article.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /packages/vbcms/item/content/phpeval.php - File does not contain expected contents
      /packages/vbcms/search/result/staticpage.php - File does not contain expected contents
  ```
  This is expected as the new patch files will no longer match the MD5 check file that is [only] generated by a full download. You can just click on Continue.

  Baby, I was born this way
