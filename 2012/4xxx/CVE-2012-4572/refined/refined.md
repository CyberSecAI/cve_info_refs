  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "If multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class name and provided their own implementations, the first application to be loaded would have its implementation used for all other applications using the same class name.",

      "Insecure custom authorization module implementation sharing."

    "impact": "A local attacker could deploy a malicious application that provides implementations of custom authorization modules to permit or deny user access based on rules they control, potentially leading to unauthorized access or denial of service.",
