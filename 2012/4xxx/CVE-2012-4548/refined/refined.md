Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-4548:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `syntax-highlighting.sh` script in cgit was vulnerable to command injection due to improper quoting of the file extension argument passed to the `highlight` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability: The script directly passes the file extension to the `highlight` command without proper sanitization or quoting. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary command line arguments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: By injecting specially crafted file extensions with arguments like `--plug-in`, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the cgit repository.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attacker needs the ability to add files to the git repository.
-  The `syntax-highlighting.sh` script is triggered when a user accesses a file with an extension that is handled by this script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to commit changes to the git repository served by cgit.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file name with an extension that contains command injection payloads.
- No special position is needed besides the ability to add files to the repository.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `syntax-highlighting.sh` script, which is considered a "contrib" script, but is widely used.
- The fix involves simply quoting the file extension argument when calling the `highlight` command.
- The issue was reported and assigned CVE-2012-4548.
- The vulnerability affects openSUSE 12.1 and 12.2 distributions.
