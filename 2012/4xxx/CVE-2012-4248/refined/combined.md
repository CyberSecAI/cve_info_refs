## Amazon Kindle Touch libkindleplugin scriptable browser plugin vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#122656

Original Release Date: 2012-07-30 | Last Revised: 2013-04-08

---

### Overview

Kindle Touch 5.1.0 contains a scriptable browser plugin which can be invoked by accessing a malicious web page.

### Description

| It has been reported that Kindle Touch 5.1.0 has introduced a NPAPI plugin /usr/lib/libkindleplugin.so (symlinked to /usrl/lib/browser/plugins/libkindleplugin.so) that can be used by the system-wide WebKit engine. libkindleplugin is scriptable by the browser and can be invoked to access its "exported" native methods when a user accesses a web page containing embedded scripts.  The user **eureka** has reported on the MobileRead [forums](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?s=c7953cc553a4aaa36e880b25aa1a6bf6&t=175368) that they have found multiple "exported" properties and methods associated with libkindleplugin.     + property test (it just returns number 500) + method dev.log + method lipc.set + method lipc.get + method todo.scheduleItems + plugin.test + plugin.lipc.test + plugin.dev.test + plugin.todo.test |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to access a specially crafted web page, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**It has been reported that Kindle Touch 5.1.2 deletes the NPAPI plugin /usr/lib/libkindleplugin.so, symlink /usrl/lib/browser/plugins/libkindleplugin.so and directory /usr/lib/browser. Users are advised to upgrade to Kindle Touch 5.1.2. |
| --- |

| **Disable** **libkindleplugin**Users are advised to disable libkindleplugin by renaming or removing the /usr/lib/browser/plugins/libkindleplugin.so symlink. |

It is scriptable plugin, so webpage can embed it and invoke it's "exported" native methods.  To embed: Code: ``` <embed type="application/kindle-chrome-scriptable-plugin"> ``` I gave enough information for googling about how to invoke methods of this embedded plugin.  So far, I've found following "exported" properties and methods:  * property **test** (it just returns number *500*) * method **dev.log** * method **lipc.set** * method **lipc.get** * method **todo.scheduleItems**  I don't know anything about parameters of these methods and don't know whether they produce sensible result at all. But if they are working, then OH-OH!, it could be dangerous, because it could be used by any website (yes, this plugin is accessible from Web Browser).  I hope someone more proficient in understanding of disassembled ARM C++ code will share more information about plugin's methods usage.   To disable plugin, just change extension of symlink in */usr/lib/browser/plugins* (or remove this symlink). I believe, it will be sufficient.  **UPD** On 23 Jul 2012 Amazon made available update to **5.1.2** which must be applied over **5.1.0** or **5.1.1**. Amongst other changes, **5.1.2** deletes NPAPI plugin */usr/lib/libkindleplugin.so*, symlink */usrl/lib/browser/plugins/libkindleplugin.so* and directory */usr/lib/browser*, thus eliminating possible remote attack vector.    ---   *Last edited by eureka; 07-30-2012 at 06:49 AM. Reason: hooray, there is official update addressing possible security issue* |

On the other hand, it could be used in new method for easy jailbreaking through website.   BTW, **@silver18**, this plugin could be used in WAF apps, I assume. You've needed to execute commands from WAF application, haven't you?  Anyway, I recommend to disable this plugin. Execute in SSH session:  Code: ``` mntroot rw && mv /usr/lib/browser/plugins/libkindleplugin.so /usr/lib/browser/plugins/libkindleplugin.so.disabled && mntroot ro && killall wafapp ``` It should be reported to Amazon immediately, but I didn't do it (and will not do) as I'm curious whether somebody would want to implement that "jailbreak through website". All information is already available in this thread.  **UPD** On 23 Jul 2012 Amazon made available update to **5.1.2** which must be applied over **5.1.0** or **5.1.1**. Amongst other changes, **5.1.2** deletes NPAPI plugin */usr/lib/libkindleplugin.so*, symlink */usrl/lib/browser/plugins/libkindleplugin.so* and directory */usr/lib/browser*, thus eliminating possible remote attack vector.    ---   *Last edited by eureka; 07-30-2012 at 06:50 AM.

One "common" practice is to make the browser suid and the user id as "nobody" (with "nobody" not having any privledges of any kind).  Not sure if the Kindle's have such a user already setup, but somebody with time on their hands might check this out for us. |
