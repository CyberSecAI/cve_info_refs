{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the `jobcontrol.py` script within the HTCondor component of Red Hat Enterprise MRG. The script does not properly handle job IDs with CPROC in square brackets, which causes the `condor_schedd` daemon to crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of error handling in job ID parsing"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial of service in `condor_schedd` if `aviary_query_server` is configured to listen on public interfaces. This denial of service is due to the `condor_schedd` process crashing. Although `condor_master` will restart `condor_schedd` after a crash, it throttles restarts, which increases the time before the service is fully available.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote execution of `/usr/share/condor/aviary/jobcontrol.py` with a crafted job ID string",
      "Network access to `aviary_query_server` if exposed on public interfaces"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to trigger the `jobcontrol.py` script or send commands to the `aviary_query_server` with a job ID containing CPROC in square brackets. If `aviary_query_server` is exposed on public interfaces, they do not need to be authenticated."
