How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: [OSSA 2012-016] Token authorization for a user in a disabled tenant
 is allowed (CVE-2012-4457)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2012-016
CVE: CVE-2012-4457
Date: September 28, 2012
Title: Token authorization for a user in a disabled tenant is allowed
Impact: High
Reporter: Rohit Karajgi (NTT Data)
Affects: Essex (prior to 2012.1.2), Folsom (prior to folsom-3
development milestone)

Description:
Rohit Karajgi reported a vulnerability in Keystone. It was possible to
get a token that is authorized for a disabled tenant. Once the token is
established with authorization on the tenant, keystone would respond 200
OK to token validation requests from other OpenStack services, allowing
the user to work with the tenant's resources.

Folsom fix: (Included in 2012.2)
<http://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/4ebfdfaf23c6da8e3c182bf3ec2cb2b7132ef685>

Essex fix: (Included in 2012.1.2)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2012-016
CVE: CVE-2012-4457
Date: September 28, 2012
Title: Token authorization for a user in a disabled tenant is allowed
Impact: High
Reporter: Rohit Karajgi (NTT Data)
Affects: Essex (prior to 2012.1.2), Folsom (prior to folsom-3
development milestone)

Description:
Rohit Karajgi reported a vulnerability in Keystone. It was possible to
get a token that is authorized for a disabled tenant. Once the token is
established with authorization on the tenant, keystone would respond 200
OK to token validation requests from other OpenStack services, allowing
the user to work with the tenant's resources.

Folsom fix: (Included in 2012.2)
<http://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/4ebfdfaf23c6da8e3c182bf3ec2cb2b7132ef685>

Essex fix: (Included in 2012.1.2)
<http://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/5373601bbdda10f879c08af1698852142b75f8d5>
