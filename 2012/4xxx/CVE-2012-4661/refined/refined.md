Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-4661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of DCERPC packets within a valid DCERPC session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:**  The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the DCERPC inspection engine. Specifically, the code does not properly validate the size or contents of the DCERPC packets it is processing. This can lead to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Reload:** An attacker can cause the affected system to reload (crash).
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The stack overflow can potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted DCERPC packet that will be inspected by the affected system.
- The vulnerability is triggered by transit traffic only (traffic that is passing through the device, not directly to the device).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send crafted DCERPC packets to a system where DCERPC inspection is enabled.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
- Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances
- Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module

**Additional Notes:**
- DCERPC inspection is not enabled by default on affected devices.
- The vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall modes and can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- Cisco bug ID is CSCtr27522.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.0.
