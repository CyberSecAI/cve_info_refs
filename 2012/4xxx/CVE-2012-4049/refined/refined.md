    "root_cause": "A large loop exists in the NFS dissector of Wireshark.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The NFS dissector can use excessive CPU resources due to a large loop vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by convincing someone to open a malformed packet trace file. This leads to excessive CPU consumption by Wireshark.",

      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network.",
      "Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic or provide a crafted file."
