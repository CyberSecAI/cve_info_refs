```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the accessaccount.cgi script of ZTE routers. The script allows changing the administrator password by submitting a POST request with the new password as a parameter "sysPassword"
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of proper authorization or input validation, leading to a CSRF vulnerability, making it possible to change the admin password without prior authentication
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can change the administrator password of the vulnerable ZTE router, gaining full control over the device.
- Attack vectors: A crafted HTML page with a form that automatically submits the POST request to the accessaccount.cgi script with the desired new password. The attacker would need to trick a user on the same network as the vulnerable router to load the crafted HTML page in their browser.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to convince a user on the same network as the vulnerable ZTE router to load the malicious HTML page, or otherwise be able to get the crafted request submitted to the router.
