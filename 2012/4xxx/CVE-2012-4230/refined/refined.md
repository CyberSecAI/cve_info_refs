Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-4230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the TinyMCE bbcode plugin overriding the editor's configured security measures for encoding and sanitizing HTML content. Specifically, when the bbcode plugin is enabled, the "encoding" option (intended to convert HTML characters to XML entities) and the "valid_elements" option (intended to limit allowed HTML elements) fail to function as expected. This allows HTML tags, including script tags, to be rendered in the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. The bbcode plugin bypasses the intended HTML encoding and sanitization, allowing arbitrary script injection through user-supplied HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Injection (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the client-side context of TinyMCE enabled applications.
- **Credential Theft:** Exploiting the vulnerability could allow attackers to steal user credentials through injected scripts.
- **Client-Side Attacks:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's browser.
- **Other Dangerous Conditions:** The injected scripts could lead to a variety of other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the TinyMCE editor interface. An attacker would input malicious HTML content, which, when processed by TinyMCE with the bbcode plugin enabled, would not be properly sanitized or encoded and thus rendered as HTML.
- The attacker needs to be able to input text into a TinyMCE editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to interact with a TinyMCE editor instance on the web application.
- The targeted TinyMCE instance must have the bbcode plugin enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TinyMCE version 3.5.8, tested with Chrome version 25.0.1364.97.
- The issue was discovered by Zach Alexander.
- The vendor does not consider this a critical security issue.
- The exploit requires that the bbcode plugin is enabled.
