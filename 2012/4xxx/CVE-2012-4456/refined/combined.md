How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Please find the attached test log from the Ubuntu Server Team's CI infrastructure. As part of the verification process for this bug, Keystone has been deployed and configured across multiple nodes using precise-proposed as an installation source. After successful bring-up and configuration of the cluster, a number of exercises and smoke tests have be invoked to ensure the updated package did not introduce any regressions. A number of test iterations were carried out to catch any possible transient errors.

Please Note the list of installed packages at the top and bottom of the report.

For records of upstream test coverage of this update, please see the Jenkins links in the comments of the relevant upstream code-review(s):

Trunk review: <https://review.openstack.org/8104>

Stable review: <https://review.openstack.org/9014>

As per the provisional Micro Release Exception granted to this package by the Technical Board, we hope this contributes toward verification of this update.

### Bug Description

Admin API /v2.0/tenants/{tenant\_id}/users/{user\_id}/roles doesn't validate the authentication token before returning a response.

i.e. we can get the same result without a token in HTTP head.

Eg:

without a token

jason@ubuntu:~/project/keystone$ curl <http://0.0.0.0:35357/v2.0/tenants/1f73672bf2184a909abc8fe67e7a537d/users/b84f6dbb6d7b4130a8a9e9298ec96164/roles> | python -m json.tool

Please find the attached test log from the Ubuntu Server Team's CI infrastructure. As part of the verification process for this bug, Keystone has been deployed and configured across multiple nodes using precise-proposed as an installation source. After successful bring-up and configuration of the cluster, a number of exercises and smoke tests have be invoked to ensure the updated package did not introduce any regressions. A number of test iterations were carried out to catch any possible transient errors.

Please Note the list of installed packages at the top and bottom of the report.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=861179#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-09-27 18:07:27 UTC  ```  Jason Xu (yinyangxu) discovered several vulnerabilities in OpenStack  Keystone token verification:  The first occurs in the API /v2.0/OS-KSADM/services and  /v2.0/OS-KSADM/services/{service_id}, the second occurs in  /v2.0/tenants/{tenant_id}/users/{user_id}/roles  In both cases the OpenStack Keystone code fails to check if the tokens are  valid. These issues have been addressed by adding checks in the form of  test_service_crud_requires_auth() and test_user_role_list_requires_auth().
