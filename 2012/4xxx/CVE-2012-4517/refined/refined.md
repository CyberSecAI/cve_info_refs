  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2012-4517",
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way ibacm, an InfiniBand communication manager assistant, performed management of reference counts for multicast connections. The default reference count value for multicast connection is set to zero and when the multicast connection got released, an attempt was made to free it, possibly resulting in ib_acm service / daemon crash.",
    "affected_components": [
      "ibacm"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Incorrect management of reference counts for multicast connections. The default reference count is set to zero, and releasing the multicast connection causes a double-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper resource management",
      "Double-free vulnerability"
     ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, leading to a crash of the ib_acm daemon.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted multicast packets"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send specially crafted multicast packets."
