  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2012-4996",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in Rivettracker version 1.03 and earlier. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied inputs in multiple files.",
      "root_cause": "Lack of input sanitization in several PHP files.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection in `dltorrent.php`: The `$_GET['hash']` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization. Although there's a length check to ensure it's 40 characters long, this can be bypassed by padding with zeros. Additionally, if null byte poisoning is not patched, a crafted query can be used to retrieve the contents of config.php.",
        "SQL Injection in `torrent_functions.php`: The `$_POST['hash']` parameter is used in SQL queries without any checks or sanitization. The `$hiddentracker` variable is also not checked when accessing this file, meaning anyone can execute arbitrary SQL commands via POST."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. Depending on the privileges of the database user, this could lead to data theft, modification, or even arbitrary code execution on the server. Specifically, sensitive information like database usernames, passwords, and admin/user credentials can be accessed via config.php.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to `dltorrent.php`: By crafting a specific hash value with padding and a UNION ALL statement.",
        "HTTP POST request to `torrent_functions.php`: By sending a crafted hash value via a form."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability in `dltorrent.php` if `$hiddentracker` is set to false. The vulnerability in `torrent_functions.php` can be exploited by any unauthenticated user, as access is not controlled by the `$hiddentracker` variable. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts."
