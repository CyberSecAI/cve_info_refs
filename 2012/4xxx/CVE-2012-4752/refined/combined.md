Subject: ownCloud - matching CVEs to fix information and vice versa

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Ok so I started looking at ownCloud to make sure I didn't issue a
duplicate.

We have the following 4 CVE entries for ownCloud and no way to match
them to a fixed version.

CVE-2012-2398	Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
files/ajax/download.php in ownCloud 3.0.2 allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the files parameter, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2012-2269.4. NOTE: the provenance of
this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from
third party information.

Is CVE-2012-2398 fixed in 3.0.3?

CVE-2012-2397	Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
ownCloud 3.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of
arbitrary users for requests that insert cross-site scripting (XSS)
sequences via vectors involving contacts. NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
party information.

Is CVE-2012-2397 fixed in 3.0.3?

CVE-2012-2270	Open redirect vulnerability in index.php (aka the Login
Page) in ownCloud 3.0.0 allows remote attackers to redirect users to
arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the
redirect_url parameter.

Is CVE-2012-2270 fixed in 3.0.1?

CVE-2012-2269	Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
ownCloud 3.0.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via (1) an arbitrary field to apps/contacts/ajax/addcard.php,
(2) the parameter parameter to apps/contacts/ajax/addproperty.php, (3)
the name parameter to apps/contacts/ajax/createaddressbook, (4) the
file parameter to files/download.php, or the (5) name, (6) user, or
(7) redirect_url parameter to files/index.php.

Is CVE-2012-2269 fixed in 3.0.1

Can you please confirm that these issues have been fixed, and in what
version of ownCloud? It would be very helpful if you could put the CVE
#'s into the ChangeLog at <http://owncloud.org/changelog/>

Once these 4 have been confirmed I can assign a CVE for the new issue
