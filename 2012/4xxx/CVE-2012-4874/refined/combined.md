## Installation

Pre-installation note: If you have previously tried other WordPress classified plugins and plan to use the same page, please make sure your database has been cleared of any posts with the same name or slug as your classifieds page.

For example, if your page will be named “Auto Listings”, you might have a wp\_posts database entry post\_title value of “Auto Listings” and post\_name value of “auto-listings” still left over from previous plugins.

You need to check your database to make sure old data does not exist. Delete all entries from your wp\_posts table where the post\_title and post\_name are the same as your classifieds page.

1. Upload the folder another-wordpress-classifieds-plugin with its contents to wp-content/plugins/
2. Activate the plugin
3. Click on the “Click here to setup your site options” link and fill out all your various options to configure how you want your classifieds to run.
4. Create some categories and sub categories for your ads.
5. Set up your payment fees if you are going to be running in pay mode.

## FAQ

For the definitive FAQ section, please visit the [FAQ Section of the Forum](https://awpcp.com/forum/faq/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), or our [Quick Start](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) guide.

### How do I install AWP Classifieds Plugin?

Please see our [Installation Guide](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-general), the [Quick Start Guide](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) for common how-to scenarios, and our [Initial Setup](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#setup) page for instructions on how to get going quickly.

Full [documentation](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) for the plugin is also available.

### What types of classified listing directories can I create?

Our classifieds website builder software combined with our add-on modules is the most powerful classifieds plugin on the market. The options for classified advertising are limitless. Here are a few types of classified directories you can create:

* Job board listings and help wanted
* Auto, truck, and car listings
* Apartment classifieds
* Property and real estate listings
* Dating and personal listings
* Fashion listings to buy and sell clothing
* Announcements for events like yard sales, reunions, auctions, and school events

### Can this plugin support paid and free listings?

Yes it can. You can do this by creating fee plans for 0.00 and some other paid amount at the same time. For more details, read [this article](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-freepaid).

### Will it work with my theme?

Our WordPress classifieds plugin will work with any well-written, WP compliant theme. Generally speaking, paid themes tend to be higher quality than free ones.

In general, we like WooThemes as a solid company with great products and support. You can check them out [here](http://woothemes.com) Or [StudioPress](http://studiopress.com​​)

### Can this plugin be translated into my language?

Yes it can. Our Classifieds directory plugin comes with many user-provided translations under the /languages folder. For details on how to do it, our [translation guide](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-translate) will help get you started.

### Is this compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)?

Yes it is. However, you cannot “network-activate” the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the subsites on which you need a directory. This can be done under Plugins->Add New as the Administrator user. Do not “network activate” AWPCP as the “super admin”.

Wanted to write for a while and as per never got round to it.I used the free version for a bit – then i needed some extra functionality for my rentals site – that the standard edition did provide for. So I upgraded – and not looked back. For me – when I purchase a plugin I dont just look for a technically proficient plugin, I look at the support offered, how quickly I get a response as well as how friendly / helpful and willing the plugin devs are.These guys (a family run business I believe) have never let me down – and this has been over a couple of years now. So this is just me saying thanks and giving something back.If you are looking for a classified plugin to use and devs to work with – try this plugin, I dont think you will regret your decision

Really Great. Wish it was fully updated to WP 6.2.2 and we could use UPPER and lower case in the Description. It used to do that

All i wanted to do, was to ensure that my users can indicate if their intended listing is a “Used Item” or “Brand New Item”. I feel this is a very vital feature that should be in every classified plugin. It wasn’t included in this plugin and i could not find a way to insert it myself. I just had to uninstall the plugin and look for another one.

Hi, I’m thinking of creating a brand db list, but in your demo, I don’t see clearly the options that your plugin is able to do.
The layout seems to be very specific for selling houses, hotels, tourism, hospitality or similar. It is something very local based. The layout will be horrible when someone wants to make an international list for other business areas. For example, brands are all over the world and we only want to configure some topics and not all of them.
I intended to do linked to international (not so focus on local map or location search). So I have some questions:
1. Is it possible to remove the location field or any other field we don’t need?
2. Is it possible to create a listing of brands with a table view? (Just the Old Fashion way to layout display, it’s easier, simple and faster… The table view, we should be able to set up the columns with the topics we want to display. Also the number of fields by page (20, 50, 100, 200)
3. In these listings is there a possibility to add categories or hashtags for topics related to that brand list? (so people will find product type tag or category according to what they search and not the location)
4. Is there a possibility to create a table with annual voting, for each company? And at the same time have a global cumulative vote (of all the years).
5. Also another field “where to buy?” .. just inside a list of places to people that need something can buy in that website list (according to country)
6. Would be interesting if, by some way, we can connect to those brands official social networks to check Number of Fans / Followers by each brand. So we also can rank them.
Maybe you don’t have these options… so I hope can be developed because will be new ideas 🙂
Please let me know if you will have these options, PM/Poke me!
Thank you,
Kind regards

### [Renew ads with another plan](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/renew-ads-with-another-plan/)

Hi,
I need that when the user wants to renew an ad, they can choose the plan they want (in the event that there are several plans). At this time, as the plugin is configured, it can only be renewed with the plan that the ad currently has. This doesn’t make sense as if you want to switch to a premium plan for example, you can’t, you would have to delete the ad and create it again with another plan.
I’m waiting.
Thank

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
