- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The TURCK BL20 and BL67 Programmable Gateways contain hard-coded user credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded credentials allow unauthorized access through the FTP service (Port 21/TCP).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain remote administrative access to the device. This could allow them to create false communications between remote I/Os, PLCs, or DCS systems, potentially causing adverse actions, including process shutdown. The vulnerability impacts the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation via the FTP service on port 21/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the device on the network (remote access). They require low technical skill to exploit the vulnerability, given they have access to the hardcoded credentials.
