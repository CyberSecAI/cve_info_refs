      "attack_vector": "The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into any of the form fields on the /Tickets/Submit page of a vulnerable Kayako Fusion installation. This code is then stored persistently and executed when a user views the ticket.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to submit a ticket on the vulnerable Kayako Fusion instance.",
       "additional_information": "The blog post provides a proof of concept (PoC) by injecting malicious JavaScript into the form fields on the /Tickets/Submit page of Kayako Fusion and demonstrating that the injected script is executed when a ticket is viewed. The blog also mentions that the vulnerability is present in 'all versions' of Kayako Fusion, and the issue was reported to Kayako and later fixed. The blog post also identifies other websites that are using the vulnerable software like Comodo and AVG."
