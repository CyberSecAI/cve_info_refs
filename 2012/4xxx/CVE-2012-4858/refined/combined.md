# IBM Cognos Business Intelligence Interim Fixes for Security Exposure

### Download

## Abstract

These interim fixes address security vulnerabilities found in IBM Cognos Business Intelligence releases.

## Download Description

These interim fixes provide important product corrections related to security for IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2.0, 10.1.1, 10.1.0 and 8.4.1.

## Prerequisites

Before installing any of the interim fixes, one of the corresponding product versions listed below must already be installed.

* IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2
* IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.1.1
* IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.1
* IBM Cognos 8 Business Intelligence 8.4.1

## Installation Instructions

**To Download an Interim Fix**

* Review the prerequisites.
* Download the appropriate compressed tar file using the links in the Download Package section.

Some browsers might change the downloaded file type from .tar.gz to a file type not recognized by the operating system. To correct this, change the file type back to .tar.gz. Use of Download Director will prevent inadvertent renaming of files at download.

**To Install an Interim Fix on Linux or UNIX**

* Copy the interim fix to the appropriate operating system.
* Change to the directory where you have downloaded the interim fix installation image.
* Enter the following command: gunzip <filename> .tar.gz | tar xvf –
* If you want to see the version of a component before you install it, unpack the tar file to disk, or read the table of contents of the tar file.
* Follow the Installation instructions in the IBM Cognos Business Intelligence Installation and Configuration Guide.
* Apply the interim fix to all installations.

Note: GNU Zip can be obtained from [www.gzip.org](http://www.gzip.org) and GNU tar can be obtained from [www.gnu.org/software/tar](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar) .

**To Install an Interim Fix on Windows**

* Change to the directory where you have downloaded the interim fix.
* Using your file compress and decompress utility, decompress the .tar.gz file. If you are using WinZip, select the option "use folder names".
* If you want to see the version of a component before you install it, unpack the tar file to disk, or read the table of contents of the tar file.
* Follow the Installation instructions in the IBM Cognos Business Intelligence Installation and Configuration Guide.
* Apply the interim fix to all installations.
