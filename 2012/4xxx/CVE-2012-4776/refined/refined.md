{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation when the .NET Framework acquires the default web proxy settings and executes JavaScript contained within the proxy auto-configuration file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of web proxy settings",
      "Unrestricted execution of JavaScript within proxy auto-configuration files"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code, gaining complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks spoofing the contents of a proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file",
      "ARP cache poisoning redirecting requests for WPAD file to an attacker-controlled IP address",
      "NBNS spoofing where the attacker spoofs responses to WPAD requests",
       "DNS devolution and DNS spoofing"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to spoof the contents of a PAC file and needs access to the local network to perform ARP cache poisoning or NBNS spoofing."
