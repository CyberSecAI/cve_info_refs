  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The default WPA2-PSK passphrase is calculated based on the device's MAC address using a static substitution table.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable passphrase generation algorithm.",
       "Limited passphrase entropy of 32-33 bits.",
       "Usage of static substitution table."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can calculate the WPA2-PSK passphrase, allowing them to passively sniff and decrypt wireless traffic or connect to the network to perform further attacks.",

      "Wireless network sniffing to obtain MAC address.",
      "Calculation of the default WPA2 passphrase based on the MAC address."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the vulnerable router and be able to passively sniff network traffic. They also need to know the vulnerable algorithm to calculate the passphrase."

      "Belkin Surf N150 Model F7D1301v1",

      "Belkin N300 Model F7D2301v1"
  ],
  "additional_information": "The default WPA2-PSK passphrase consists of 8 hexadecimal digits. The WAN MAC address is derived from the WLAN MAC address by adding 1 or 2 depending on the model, this is used to compute the passphrase via a substitution table. The vulnerability can be exploited using offline brute-force attacks after obtaining a handshake, due to the low entropy of the generated passphrase."
