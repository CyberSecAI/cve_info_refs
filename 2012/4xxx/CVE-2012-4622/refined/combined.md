Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects only the Catalyst 4500E series switch with Supervisor Engine 7L-E running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 03.02.00.XO.15.0(2)XO. The device is vulnerable when running an affected version of Cisco IOS XE Software, regardless of the configuration of the device      To identify the hardware type log into the device and issue the **show module** Cisco IOS XE Software CLI command. The following example shows a Catalyst 4500-E Series with a Catalyst Supervisor Engine 7L-E installed: ```      ```   switch#show module   Chassis Type : WS-C4507R+E      Power consumed by backplane : 40 Watts      Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.   ---+-----+--------------------------------------+------------------+-----------    4     6  Sup 7L-E 10GE (SFP+), 1000BaseX (SFP)  WS-X45-SUP7L-E     CAT1532L4ZA    5    48  10/100/1000BaseT (RJ45)                WS-X4448-GB-RJ45   JAB023456A3   ```      ``` To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.      The following example identifies a Catalyst 4500E series switch with Supervisor Engine 7L-E that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 03.02.00.XO.15.0(2)XO with an installed image name of cat4500e-universal.SPA: ```   Catalyst_4500#show version   Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software, Catalyst 4500 L3 Switch Software (cat4500e-UNIVERSAL-M), Version 03.02.00.XO RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2011 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Details  * Cisco Catalyst 4500E series switches with Supervisor Engine 7L-E contain a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device supervisor card to reload.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed network packets. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to or through the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to reload the affected device supervisor card, resulting in a DoS condition.   When the specially crafted packets are received the device will indicate an error message about an uncorrected error-correcting code (ECC) failure. The following is an example of this error message:      %C4K\_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-4-VFEL2INTERRUPT: (Suppressed 9 times)VFE L2 sptMemory interrupt. valid: 1 addr: 0x0 data: 0x0 **uncorrected** ecc: 0      IF 100 of these packets have been received in a period of less than 72 hours, the device will reload.      There are also packets that would cause a similar error message but result in a corrected ECC error message. These are informational and do not have an impact on the device itself. The following is an example of this error message:      %C4K\_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-4-VFEL2INTERRUPT: VFE L2 sptMemory interrupt. valid: 1 addr: 0x0 data: 0x0 **corrected** ecc: 2      The device is vulnerable when running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 03.02.00.XO.15.0(2)XO, regardless of the configuration of the device.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCty88456](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty88456) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4622.  Workarounds  * The are no workarounds for this vulnerability. The use of port access control lists (PACL) and VLAN access control lists (VACL) does not mitigate this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
