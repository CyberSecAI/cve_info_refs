# Clickjacking

**Author:** Gustav Rydstedt

**Contributor(s):** Wichers, Jmanico, MichaelCoates, Till Maas, Ajay, Michael Monsivais, Arun Kumar V, Abhinav, Neil Smithline, kingthorin, Shai Alon

Clickjacking, also known as a “UI redress attack”, is when an attacker
uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking
on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on
the top level page. Thus, the attacker is “hijacking” clicks meant
for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by
another application, domain, or both.

Using a similar technique, keystrokes can also be hijacked. With a
carefully crafted combination of stylesheets, iframes, and text boxes, a
user can be led to believe they are typing in the password to their
email or bank account, but are instead typing into an invisible frame
controlled by the attacker.

# Examples

For example, imagine an attacker who builds a web site that has a button
on it that says “click here for a free iPod”. However, on top of that
web page, the attacker has loaded an iframe with your mail account, and
lined up exactly the “delete all messages” button directly on top of the
“free iPod” button. The victim tries to click on the “free iPod” button
but instead actually clicked on the invisible “delete all messages”
button. In essence, the attacker has “hijacked” the user’s click, hence
the name “Clickjacking”.

One of the most notorious examples of Clickjacking was an attack against
the [Adobe Flash plugin settings
page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html).
By loading this page into an invisible iframe, an attacker could trick a
user into altering the security settings of Flash, giving permission for
any Flash animation to utilize the computer’s microphone and camera.

Clickjacking also made the news in the form of a [Twitter
worm](http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/feb/twitter-dont-click-exploit).
This clickjacking attack convinced users to click on a button which
caused them to re-tweet the location of the malicious page, and
propagated massively.

There have also been clickjacking attacks abusing Facebook’s “Like”
functionality. [Attackers can trick logged-in Facebook users to
arbitrarily like fan pages, links, groups,
etc](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/facebook-jacking-scams-expand-060310)

# Defending against Clickjacking

There are three main ways to prevent clickjacking:

1. Sending the proper Content Security Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive response headers that instruct the browser to not allow framing from other domains. The older `X-Frame-Options` HTTP headers is used for graceful degradation and older browser compatibility.
2. Properly setting authentication cookies with `SameSite=Strict` (or `Lax`), unless they explicitly need `None` (which is rare).
3. Employing defensive code in the UI to ensure that the current frame is the most top level window.

For more information on Clickjacking defense, please see the the [Clickjacking Defense Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet.html).

## Pattern Insight 2.3 contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#802596

Original Release Date: 2012-11-02 | Last Revised: 2012-11-08

---

### Overview

The Pattern Insight web interface contains multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html): Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) CVE-2012-4935: Pattern Insight: CSRF protections do not exist  When an already authorized victim navigates to a malicious site containing a hidden form request, it is possible for the malicious site to make authenticated requests to Pattern Insight on behalf of the victim.[CWE-16](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/16.html): Configuration: CVE-2012-4936: Pattern Insight: clickjacking/framing vulnerabilityIt is possible to frame the application and thus is vulnerable to clickjacking. This can be mitigated by adding "X-Frame-Options" => "DENY" to the response headers. Furthermore, frame busting code can be added to the application for further protection and in the case that the victim's browser does not support X-Frame-Options. See <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking>[CWE-384](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384.html): Session Fixation CVE-2012-4937: Pattern Insight: Insecure session management leading to privilege escalationPattern Insight session management is insecure, making privilege escalation and authentication bypass possible. When a user logs into Pattern Insight, the user's browser either has or does not have a jsession\_id session cookie associated with the Pattern Insight domain. If the user does not have a session cookie associated with the Pattern Insight domain, the server provides the user a jsession\_id and associates that session id with the user's current session. If the user already has a session cookie associated with the Pattern Insight domain, the server checks the "validity" of the session cookie. If the cookie is of "valid" form, the server associates the provided jsession\_id session cookie with user's new session.Attack scenario:1. Attacker obtains a "valid" session key.2. Attacker sets victim's jsession\_id session cookie with the "valid" session key in step 13. The attacker now knows the session id of a valid session[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CVE-2012-4938: Pattern Insight: HTML Injection In Banner MessageAn admin can edit the banner message seen by all users. HTML is allowed in this message. A possible solution is anti-samy for whitelisting where HTML is still needed ([https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP\_AntiSamy\_Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category%3AOWASP_AntiSamy_Project)).[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CVE-2012-4950 Pattern Insight: HTML Injection In Keyword Search pageThe error messages on the Keyword Search page do not properly escape characters after encountering a character that the backend cannot parse. This results in a reflective XSS if an attacker sends a victim a properly crafted URL and the victim visits the application using that link. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with access to the Pattern Insight web interface can conduct a cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, or privilege escalation attack, which could be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service. Also, with the ability to frame the application, an attacker can perform clickjacking attacks. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Pattern Insight web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
