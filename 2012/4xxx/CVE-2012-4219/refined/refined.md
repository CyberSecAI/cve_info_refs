Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the `show_config_errors.php` script missing a necessary library include. This omission leads to an error message that reveals the full path of the script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server path to the `show_config_errors.php` script.
- **Information Leakage:** This information leak can aid attackers in gaining more knowledge about the server's file system structure, potentially making further exploitation easier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Gathering:** Attackers can gather information about the server's file system structure, which can be used for further attacks. While not directly critical, this information can be very valuable to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request:** Attackers can access the vulnerable script (`show_config_errors.php`) via a web browser or other HTTP client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
- **PHP Configuration:** The PHP configuration on the server must have `error_reporting` set to `E_ALL` and `display_errors` set to `On`. These settings are not recommended for production servers, and the exploit relies on misconfiguration of the server.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** phpMyAdmin versions 3.5.x before 3.5.2.1 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 3.5.2.1 or newer, or apply the provided patch. The patch involves adding the line `require './libraries/common.inc.php';` to the `show_config_errors.php` script.
- **Severity:** This vulnerability is considered non-critical because it relies on a misconfigured server. However, it can still aid attackers in reconnaissance.
- **CWE:** This vulnerability is associated with CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-200 (Information Exposure).

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specific details about the vulnerable script, the configuration requirements for exploitation, and the solution to address the vulnerability.
