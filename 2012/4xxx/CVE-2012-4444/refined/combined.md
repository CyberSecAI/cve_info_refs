An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has 8 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP4 kernel has been updated to
fix various bugs and security issues.
Security issues fixed:
\*
CVE-2012-4444: The ip6\_frag\_queue function in
net/ipv6/reassembly.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
attackers to bypass intended network restrictions via
overlapping IPv6 fragments.
\*
CVE-2013-1928: The do\_video\_set\_spu\_palette function
in fs/compat\_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel lacked a certain
error check, which might have allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted VIDEO\_SET\_SPU\_PALETTE ioctl call on a /dev/dvb
device.
Also the following bugs have been fixed:
\* hugetlb: Fix regression introduced by the original
patch (bnc#790236, bnc#819403).
\* NFSv3/v2: Fix data corruption with NFS short reads
(bnc#818337).
\* Fix package descriptions in specfiles (bnc#817666).
\* TTY: fix atime/mtime regression (bnc#815745).
\* virtio\_net: ensure big packets are 64k (bnc#760753).
\* virtio\_net: refill rx buffers when oom occurs
(bnc#760753).
\* qeth: fix qeth\_wait\_for\_threads() deadlock for OSN
devices (bnc#812317, LTC#90910).
\* nfsd: remove unnecessary NULL checks from
nfsd\_cross\_mnt (bnc#810628).
\* knfsd: Fixed problem with NFS exporting directories
which are mounted on (bnc#810628).

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1580)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, numerous bugs
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* It was found that the RHSA-2012:0862 update did not correctly fix the

CVE-2011-4131 issue. A malicious Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)
server could return a crafted reply to a GETACL request, causing a denial
of service on the client. (CVE-2012-2375, Moderate)

* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the TCP Illinois congestion control

algorithm implementation in the Linux kernel. If the TCP Illinois
congestion control algorithm were in use (the sysctl
net.ipv4.tcp\_congestion\_control variable set to "illinois"), a local,
unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2012-4565, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way a new node's hot

added memory was propagated to other nodes' zonelists. By utilizing this
newly added memory from one of the remaining nodes, a local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-5517,
Moderate)

* It was found that the initial release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 did

not correctly fix the CVE-2009-4307 issue, a divide-by-zero flaw in the
ext4 file system code. A local, unprivileged user with the ability to mount
an ext4 file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2012-2100, Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled overlapping, fragmented IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could
potentially use this flaw to bypass protection mechanisms (such as a
firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS)) when sending network packets
to a target system. (CVE-2012-4444, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Antonios Atlasis working with Beyond Security's
SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program and Loganaden Velvindron of AFRINIC
for reporting CVE-2012-4444. The CVE-2012-2375 issue was discovered by Jian
Li of Red Hat, and CVE-2012-4565 was discovered by Rodrigo Freire of Red
Hat.

This update also fixes numerous bugs and adds one enhancement. Space
precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Documentation
for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6.3 Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, fix these bugs and add the enhancement
noted in the Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

So the rational here is that:

1) The RFC says overlapping IPv6 fragments should be dropped (in fact
all the fragments for that datagram should be dropped).
2) Generally speaking there is no real legitimate case for overlapping
IPv6 (or IPv4) fragments, and in fact they are quite dangerous:

<http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/72/slides/6man-5.pdf>
- -Overlapping fragments were allowed in the original
IPv4 specification (RFC791)
- -RFC1858 described an overlapping fragment attack
that can be used to overwrite the TCP flags inside a
packet

IPv6 datagrams can include a destination options
header
- -This header belongs to the fragmentable part of the
datagram
- -TCP header can be much further into the fragmentable
part
- -Makes it possible to even overwrite port info.

So basically IPv6 overlapping fragments are quite dangerous and can
potentially be used to bypass firewalls/IDS/NIDS/etc.

Also I'm guessing there are a lot of "embedded" (not sure what term to
use when network devices now have full computers in them, e.g.
photocopiers) IPv6 stacks that will not handle overlapping fragments
(crash, memory overwrite, who knows) and cannot be upgraded by users
(since the devices are not supported/not supported properly by the
makers).

So in a nutshell by not implementing RFC5722 we allow all manner of
poorly defined and probably unwanted behaviours to take place,
additionally we may end up passing nasty traffic to back end systems
that cannot handle it well (and are expecting the front end machines
to sanitize the traffic).

So to this end I am assigning CVE-2012-4444 (been saving it, it's easy
to remember =) for "failure to implement RFC5722 properly, allowing
overlapping fragmented IPv6 packets to be processed or passed to other
systems resulting in all sorts of potential unknown badness with
unknown consequences". It looks like more than just Linux is affected,
so if you know of other systems that are affected by this please reply
to this thread so we have a list.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Attacking IPv6 Implementation Using Fragmentation

Antonios Atlasis

Centre for Strategic Cyberspace + Security Science

antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

Abstract

IP   fragmentation   attacks   is   not   a   new   issue.   There   are   many   publications   regarding   their
exploitation   for   various   purposes,   including,   but   not   limited   to,   Operating   Systems   (OS)
fingerprinting, IDS/IPS insertion/evasion, firewall evasion and even remote code execution. The
adoption of the new IP version, IPv6, has opened new potential exploitation fields to the attackers
and pen testers. In this paper, it will be examined whether fragmentation issues still remain in IPv6
implementation   of   some   of   the   most   popular   OS   and   whether   they   can   also   be   used   for   the
aforementioned purposes. To this end, several fragmentation attacks will be presented and their
impact will be examined. As it will be shown, most of the popular OS, such as Windows, Linux and
OpenBSD are susceptible to such attacks. In each case, the corresponding proof of concept code is
provided.   As   it   will   be   explained,   such   attacks,   under   specific   circumstances   can   lead   to   OS
fingerprinting,   IDS   insertion/evasion   and   firewalls   evasion.   Finally,   these   tests   will   also   show
which OS appears to be the most immune to IPv6 fragmentation attacks.

1 Introduction

IP  version   6   (IPv6),   the     “new”   version   of   the   Internet   Protocol,   has   been   designed   as   the
successor to IP version 4 (IPv4) [RFC 2460, 1998]. One of the main reasons that pushes towards the
adoption of this new version of Internet Protocol is the anticipated exhaustion of the available IPv4
addresses.  Although   the   last   decade   there   is   a   lot   of   controversy   about   this   issue   and   many,
sometimes contradictory, predictions regarding this exhaustion have been published, it is inevitable
that the transition from IPv4 to IP6 will finally happen, sooner or later.    To this end, due to the
necessity of preparing and moving to the IPv6 era, on 8 June, 2011, an “ World IPv6 Day” was
organised   by   the   Internet   Society,   in   order   to   help   motivate   organizations,   ISPs,   hardware
manufacturers, operating system vendors and other web companies–to prepare their services for the
transition  (http://www.worldipv6day.org/). In this  event, more than  a thousand popular  websites
participated, showing that the day which IPv6 transition will happen, in not far away.

This   forthcoming   transition   from   IPv4   to   IPv6   should   not   only   find   the   industry   and   the
community well-prepared, but any security issues related with the new protocol should have been
eliminated. It would be rather disastrous in the rise of the IPv6 era if significant security incidents
would take place due to its implementation. As of the end of 2011, 102 vulnerabilities related with
the IPv6 in various OS implementations have been recorded in CVE, the 3 of which are related
specifically with the IPv6 fragmentation.

There are many different aspects that should be examined regarding the security mechanisms
provided by a network layer protocol like IPv6. Definitely, one of the key issues that should be
examined is the support of fragmentation, how it is handled and if it can be exploited by attackers
for several reasons, such as OS fingerprinting, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) insertion/evasion,
or even remote code execution.

In this paper, after reviewing briefly some of the most popular IPv4 fragmentation attacks, we
shall examine how fragmentation takes places in IPv6 and what measures are suggested by the
corresponding   RFCs   regarding   this   issue.   Then,   we   shall   perform   some   selective   examples   of

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

fragmentation   attacks   against   some   of   the   most   popular   Operating   Systems   (OS)   and   we   will
examine the security issues that may arise from such attacks.

2 Firewall and IDS Insertion and Evasion Attacks Using IP

Fragmentation
Fragmentation attacks are not new to IPv6. To the best of the author's knowledge this issue was
first examined in [NEWSHAM 1998]. IDS, in order to handle properly fragmentation attacks (as
well as many other similar attacks, e.g. invalid IP headers), must handle fragments exactly the same
way that the end-systems protected by this IDS handles them.

In [NEWSHAM 1998], three classes of attacks were defined against IDS: insertion, evasion and
Denial of Service attacks. As defined in this paper, insertion attacks take place when an IDS accepts
a packet that the end-system rejects (figure 1). An IDS that does this makes the mistake of believing
that the end-system has accepted and processed the packet when it actually hasn't. An attacker, by
manipulating the sending packets properly, can use this type of attacks to defeat signature analysis
and to pass undetected through an IDS.

The target rejects character “R”, which IDS accepts; this breaks the IDS signature.

Figure 1: Example of an IDS insertion.

On the other hand, an IDS evasion takes place when an end-system accepts a packet that an IDS
rejects (figure 2). As it is also explained in [NEWSHAM 1998], an IDS that mistakenly rejects such
a packet misses its content entirely, resulting in slipping through the IDS. Evasion attacks disrupt
stream reassembly by causing the IDS to miss part of it. Such attacks are exploited even more easily
that insertion attacks.

There are several ambiguities that can lead to IDS insertion/evasion attacks, a representative
listing of which can be found in figure 7 of [NEWSHAM 1998]. Some of them are due to different
handling of fragmented packets between the end-systems and the IDS. This paper will concentrate
on fragmentation attacks only.

Fragmentation attacks, as summarised in [NEWSHAM 1998], are the following:

• Disordered arrival of fragments (this may include reassembly of the packets by the packets

before all the fragments arrive).

•

IDS flooding by partial fragmented datagrams (which may lead to IDS memory exhaustion
and hence, to IDS DoS).

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

•

Selective dropping of old and incomplete fragmented datagram (if the dropping criterion
used by the IDS is different than the one used by the end-systems).

• Overlapping fragments (and depending if the overlap favours old or new data). Moreover, it

can result in attacks like the Teardrop attack.

•

IP Options in Fragment Streams.

Figure 2: Example of an IDS Evasion

Fragmentation overlapping can lead, under specific circumstances, to firewalls' evasion too. As
explained in [RFC1858, 1995], IP fragmentation can be used to disguise TCP packets from IP filters
used in routers and hosts. As explained in this RFC, firewall evasion can be achieved by using
either a tiny fragment attack or an overlapping fragment attack (in cases where reassembly favours
the second overlapping fragment). As an example, in the first case TCP flags are transmitted in the
second fragment (and hence, firewalls that examine only the first fragment of each datagram miss
that information). An example of the second case is when the first fragment has only the ACK flag
set (and hence, passes through a stateless firewall since it seems  like a response to a previous
outgoing connection), while the second one has the SYN flag set and overlap (and overwrites) the
first   fragment.   In   order   to   prevent   both   of   the   aforementioned   attacks,   [RFC1858,   1995]
recommends that when the upper-layer protocol is TCP, packets with a fragment offset of 1 should
be dropped.

DoS attacks using IP fragmentation will not be examined in this paper.

As it is further explained in  [Novak, 2005], it is rather trivial to exploit different reassembly
policies by the various OS for IDS evasion purposes, unless the IDS uses exactly the same policy as
the destination host. This is the reason why the open source IDS/IPS Snort implements target-based
analysis with the stream5 and frag3 preprocessors [Novak, Sturges 2007].

3 Fragmentation in IPv6

3.1 IPv6 Extension Headers

One of the most significant changes that takes place in IPv6, apart from the expanded addressing
capabilities,   is   the   improved   support   for   (header)   extensions   and   options  [RFC   2460,   1998].
Specifically,   while   some   IPv4   header   fields   have   been   dropped   to   reduce   the   common-case

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

processing cost of packet handling, IPv6 Extension Headers have been optionally added to support
any  extra   required   functionality  per   case.  These   optional   headers   are   placed   between   the   IPv6
header and the upper-layer header in a packet and each one of them is identified by a distinct Next
Header value. An IPv6 packet may carry zero, one, or more extension headers. Each extension
header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long, in order to retain an 8-octet alignment for subsequent
headers, and should occur at most once (except for the Destination Options header which should
occur at most twice).

When more than one extension header is used in the same packet, it is recommended that those

headers appear in the following order [RFC 2460, 1998]:

•

IPv6 header

• Hop-by-Hop Options header

• Destination Options header

• Routing header

•

Fragment header

• Authentication header

• Encapsulating Security Payload header

• Destination Options header (for options to be processed only by the final destination of the

packet.)

• Upper-layer header

If the upper-layer header is another IPv6 header (in the case of IPv6 being tunneled over or
encapsulated   in  IPv6),  it   may be  followed  by its  own  extension   headers,  which   are  separately
subject to the same ordering recommendations.

As we can see, after the Fragment Header, three more IPv6 Extension Headers may follow. As
we shall see, this can be proven to be an advantage for the attackers if used in combination with
fragmentation in order to bypass IDS or even firewall detection.

3.2 The IPv6 Fragment Header

In   IPv6,   the   DF   and   the   MF   bits   have   been   removed   from   the   (main)   header;   instead,
fragmentation is accomplished using an Extension Header, the  Fragment Header.  Hence, all the
fragmentation-related   fields   have   been   moved   from   the   IP   header   to   the   Fragment   Extension
Header, except from the DF field, which has been totally removed. That is because, unlike IPv4, in
IPv6  the  fragmentation  is   performed  only  by the  source  nodes   and not  by  the  routers  along  a
packet's delivery path.

IPv6 attempts to minimise the use of fragmentation by minimising the supported MTU size as
well as by allowing only the hosts to fragment datagrams; on the contrary, in IPv4 intermediate
routers could also perform fragmentation, if required.

Specifically, IPv6 requires that every link in the Internet have an MTU of 1280 octets or greater
[RFC 2460, 1998]. If this is not the case, (i.e., there is a link in the path that cannot convey a 1280-
octet packet in one piece), link-specific fragmentation and reassembly must be provided at a layer
below IPv6.

The   Fragment   Header   (figure   3),   as   well   as   most   of   the   other   Extension   Headers,   are   not
examined or processed by any node along a packet's delivery path, until the packet reaches the node

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

(or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicasting). Finally, the Fragment header, which is
identified by a Next Header value of 44 in the immediately preceding header, should occur at most
once in each packet and it has the format presented in figure 3 [RFC 2460, 1998]:

0

7 8

15 16

Next Header

Reserved

Fragment Offset

31

Identification

Figure 3: The IPv6 Fragment Header

In the above figure:

• Next Header  identifies the header type of the next header in this packet  (using the same

values as the IPv4 Protocol field [RFC-1700 et seq.]).

• Reserved  is initialized to zero for transmission and it is ignored on reception.

• Fragment Offset defines the offset, in 8-octet units, of the data following this header relative

to the start of the Fragmentable Part of the original packet.

• Res is a 2-bit reserved field, initialized to zero for transmission and ignored on reception.

• M flag is a bit set to 1 when more fragments will follow or 0 if this is the last fragment, and

•

Identification defines the fragments which belong to the same packet. This number must be
different than that of any other fragmented packet sent recently (i.e. within the maximum
likely lifetime of a packet) with the same Source Address and Destination Address.

Each fragment, except possibly the last one, is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.

An example of an IPv6 fragmentation is given in figure 4.

3.3 Potential IPv6 Fragmentation Issues

According   to  [RFC   2460,   1998],   the   following   error   conditions   may   arise   regarding   the

reassembly of fragmented packets:

•

•

•

If not all the fragments that comprise the complete datagram are received within 60 secs of
the reception of the first-arriving fragment, reassembly of this specific datagram must be
abandoned   and   all   the   fragments   that   have   been   received   for   this   datagram   must   be
discarded.   If   the   first   fragment   is   included   in   the   received   fragments,   an   ICMP   Time
Exceeded -- Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded message should be sent to the source of
that fragment.

If the length of a fragment is not a multiple of 8 octets and this is not the last fragment, then
that fragment must be discarded and an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should
be sent back to the source, pointing to the Payload Length field of the fragment packet.

If   the   length   and   offset   of   a   fragment   are   such   that   the   Payload   Length   of   the   packet
reassembled from that fragment would exceed 65,535 octets, then that fragment must be
discarded and an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message  should  be sent back to the
source of the fragment, pointing to the Fragment Offset field of the fragment packet.

3.4 Handling of Overlapping IPv6 Fragments

IPv6   fragmentation,   as   defined   in   [RFC   2460,   1998],   does   not   prevent   or   disallow   the
overlapping   of   fragments.   To   this   end,   a   new   RFC   was   published   [RFC   5722,   2009],   which
specifies the policy for handling IPv6 overlapping fragments. Due to the fact the security measures
proposed by the [RFC 1858, 1995] cannot be applied effectively in the case of IPv6, because of the
use of the extension headers, this new RFC recommends that overlapping fragments should be
totally disallowed. Specifically, it defines that, when reassembling an IPv6 datagram, if one or more
of its constituent fragments is determined to be an overlapping fragment, the entire datagram (and
any constituent fragments, including those not yet received) must be silently discarded.

4 Potential Attack Vectors against the IPv6 Implementation

All the aforementioned recommendations of the corresponding IPv6 RFCs are potential attack
vectors against the Operating Systems, as long as at least one of them does not comply with them.
In case of discrepancies between the behaviour of several OS, this can lead to the following issues:

• OS fingerprinting.

•

•

IDS insertion or IDS evasion (depending on the position to the network of the OS that
accepts a packet).

Firewall evasion.

Some of the issues that can be examined regarding the OS behaviour as far as the handling the

IPv6 fragments is concerned, are the following:

• Acceptance of fragments smaller than 1280 octets.

• Acceptance of fragments after a 60 secs delay and if not, whether an ICMP Time Exceeded

-- Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded message is send back to the sender.

• Acceptance of fragments whose length is not a multiple of 8 octets and these are not the last
fragments and if they aren't, whether an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message is sent
back to the sender.

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

• Acceptance of fragmented packets whose reassembled datagram exceeds 65,535 octets and
if not, whether an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0 message is sent back to the sender.

• Acceptance   of   overlapping   fragments   and   if   they   are   not,   whether   they   are   silently
discarded. Especially as far as fragmentation overlapping is concerned, several overlapping
patterns can be examined.

Regarding the firewall evasion, there are new possibilities for the attackers because of the use of
the   extension   headers.  As   it   was   explained   in   subsection  3.1,   after   the   Fragment   header,   three
additional extension headers may follow (the Authentication header, the Encapsulating Security
Payload header and the Destination Options header). As an example, the Destination Options header
has a variable length and if we take into account its Header Extension Length field, which is an 8-
bit unsigned integer, its total length can reach 264 octets (8 standard octets plus 256 ones). This is
the   reason   why   [RFC   5722,   2009]   prevents   fragmentation   overlapping   (see   subsection  3.4).
However, even without overlapping and if fragments smaller than the recommended ones (1280
bytes – [RFC2460, 1998]) are accepted, then by properly manipulating fragments, firewall evasion
is possible (unless they collect all the fragments and reassemble the datagram before examining it,
performing the so called deep packet inspection).

5 Abusing Fragmentation in IPv6

In this section, several ways of IPv6 fragmentation will be used to test the behaviour of some of

the most popular OS and their potential compliance with the corresponding RFCs.

The   tests  took  place  under   the  default  installation   of  the  Operating  Systems  (only the   IPv6

addresses were configured properly to be able to reach them in the lab environment).

For our experiments, the most representative OS from each OS  family were examined. The

tested OS are the following:

• Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS, kernel 2.6.32-38 i386.

• Ubuntu 11.10, kernel 3.0.0-15 i386.

• Windows 7 i386.

•

•

FreeBSD 8.2 RELEASE p3, i386.

FreeBSD 9 RELEASE #0, amd64

• OpenBSD 5.0 i386

As an upper-layer protocol, the ICMPv6 was used and specifically, the Echo Request type of
ICMPv6 messages. This was chosen because not only the ICMP is the simplest protocol that can
invoke a response, since for example it does not require a three-way handshaking, as TCP does, but
it also echoes back the payload of the Echo Request packet. Hence, using a unique payload per
packet,  the fragmentation reassembly policy of the target can easily be identified.  Of course, in
cases of fragmentation methods that invoke responses, the same methods can also be used with the
TCP layer as an upper-layer protocol.

During our experiments, several fragmentation overlapping techniques were tested, including the
ones described in [NEWSHAM 1998] and in [Paxson, Shankar, 2003]. We found out that most of
the known fragmentation attack techniques were handled properly from some of the OS only. In this
section, we will use various fragmentation/overlapping patterns, including the aforementioned ones,
to test their handling from them target OS. The experiments were performed using Scapy, a really
powerful and easy to use  packet manipulation program [Scapy], which allowed us to create any

custom IPv6 packet we desired.

5.1 The Use of Tiny Fragments and Potential Evasion of IPv6 Firewalls

As it was mentioned in subsection 3.2, according to [RFC 2460, 1998], IPv6 requires that every
link in the internet has an MTU of 1280 octets or greater and if this is not the case, link-specific
fragmentation and reassembly must be provided at a layer  below  IPv6. However, RFC does not
define how IPv6 should handle packets with length smaller than 1280 octets.

To this end, the first test that it was run against the targeted OS was the use of fragments smaller
than 1280 octects, and specifically, the use of the smallest possible fragments. Since the ICMPv6
header is 8-octects long, we send it in the 1st fragment and in the 2nd one we send a payload of 8
bytes (figure 5). The Scapy PoC code can be found in Appendix A (subsection 7.1) using as input
parameters the value one (1) octet both as a length and as an offset.

Figure 5: Simple Fragmentation Using Small Fragments

All of the tested OS sent an echo reply to the sender, (Windows 7 also produced a lot of “noise”,
by trying for example to automatically connect to teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com). Hence, all major OS
accept fragments as small as 56 bytes (including the IPv6 header = 40 bytes + 8 bytes the IPv6
Fragment Header + 8 bytes of the ICMPv6 Header). Hence, although the use of IPv6 fragmentation
is discouraged by not allowing fragments smaller than 1280 octets, all major OS accept such small
fragments.

Although at a first glance this may not seem to be a very significant issue, if we combine such
small fragments with the use of Destination Options extension header, we can deliver the upper-
layer header with the second, third, or so fragment (as explained in section 4, the total length of the
Destination Options header can reach 264 bytes). By dividing this length with the 8 bytes payload
per fragment, this means that the Destination Options header will be delivered in ...33 fragments,
with 8 bytes payload each. Hence, all the firewall appliances that do not reassemble the whole
datagram before filtering it (that is, they do not perform deep packet inspection), or if they inspect
only the 33 first IPv6 fragments, they will miss the upper-layer header and thus, may be evaded.

In the case of IPv4, since the upper-layer header has to follow the IPv4 header and thus, at least a
part of it had to be in the 1st fragment, fragmentation overlapping by subsequent fragments had to be
used to evade firewalls. This is the reason why [RFC 1858, 1995] suggested that if the TCP layer
header was found in a fragment other than the first one, it should be dropped. On the contrary, in
IPv6 and due to the use of extension headers, the aforementioned policy cannot be applied; in this
case,   firewall   evasion   may   be   achieved   without   even   using   fragmentation   overlapping,   but   by
splitting the datagram  to very small fragments which all the tested OS accept and by combining
them with the use of the extension headers.

5.2 Simple Fragmentation Overlapping

In this test we used two fragmented IPv6 packets with payload 1288 bytes each (including the 8

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

bytes of the fragmentation header, resulting in 1280 net payload each). This value was chosen to be
slightly bigger than the minimum accepted IPv6 fragment, according to RFC 2460, although we
demonstrated   through   the   previous   experiment   that   all   the   tested   OS   do   not   comply  with   this
recommendation.   The   packet   was   fragmented   into   two   fragments,   with   the   second   fragment
partially overlapping the first one (figure 6).

Figure 6: Simple Fragmentation Overlapping

According to our results, FreeBSD 8.2/9, Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 did not respond with an
ICMPv6   Echo   Reply   (as   they   shouldn't,   implying   that   they   do   not   accept   the   fragmentation
overlapping), while in the case of Ubuntu 10.04 and OpenBSD 5, ping reply is received (figure 7).
In the case of Ubuntu 10.04 and OpenBSD, ICMPv6 EchoReply contains 1272 bytes from each
fragment (1 octet of bytes from the payload of the second fragment is lost – the first fragment
overwrites any overlapped part of the second).

Figure 7: Results of simple Fragmentation Overlapping

This  is more clearly displayed if we repeat the same fragmentation overlapping using small
fragments (PoC code at Appendix A, subsection 7.1 for length=2 and offset=1). In this test, the 1st
fragment includes the ICMPv6 Echo Request plus the 1st octet of bytes of the ICMPv6 payload (the
characters   “AAAAAAAA”)   and   the   second   fragment   includes   the   next   16-bytes   of   ICMPv6
payload (the characters “BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB”), but at offset 1 (instead of the correct offset
  an   ICMPv6   Echo   reply   received   with   a   payload
2).

  From   Ubuntu   10.04,

“AAAAAAAABBBBBBBB”, which shows that the first fragment overlaps the second (and not the
vice-versa) – figure 8.

Figure 8: Results of simple Fragmentation Overlapping Using Small Fragments

Then, we varied the overlapping offset of the fragments that were sent against our targets. To this
end, the PoC code of the subsection 7.1 was also used. For example, using fragments of 160 octets
each, the offsets of 1, 20, 60, 100 and 158 octets were used for the second fragment, instead of the
correct offset of 160 octets.

The experiments confirmed that FreeBSD, Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 are immune to such
fragmentation overlapping. On the other hand, both Ubuntu 10.04 and OpenBSD were proven to be
susceptible to these attacks. For instance, the response of both OpenBSD 5 and Ubuntu 10.04 for
offset =1 (which implies a 159 octets overlapping) is shown in figure 9. As we can infer from the
responses, these two OS accept the fragmentation overlapping with the first fragment overwriting
the second one.

5.3 The Paxson/Shankar Model

In [Paxson, Shankar, 2003] a specific model of overlapping fragments was proposed to test all
the methods of reassembly used by the modern OS of that era. Specifically, this model consists of a
series of six fragments of varying length and offsets. The fragmentation methods tested by this
model, are the following:

• At least one fragment that is wholly overlapped by a subsequent fragment with an identical

offset and length.

• At least one fragment that is partially overlapped by a subsequent fragment with an offset

greater than the original.

• At least one fragment this is partially overlapped by a subsequent fragment with an offset

less than the original.

Figure 10: The Paxson/Shankar Fragmentation Model

Using the Paxon/Shankar model, the following different fragment reassembly methods that were

used by the OS of that era were discovered [Novak, 2005], [Novak, Sturges 2007]:

• BSD favors an original fragment EXCEPT when the subsequent segment begins before the

original segment.

• BSD-right (Solaris)  favors the subsequent segment EXCEPT when the original segment
ends after the subsequent segment, or begins before the original segment and ends the same
or after the original segment.

• Linux favors the subsequent segment EXCEPT when the original segment begins before, or

the original segment begins the same and ends after the subsequent segment.

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

• First favors the original fragment.

• Last favors the subsequent fragment.

The above reassembly methods, taking into account the fragmentation example of figure 10, are

displayed below [Paxson, Shankar, 2003]:

• BSD policy:

111442333666

• BSD-right policy:

144422555666

• Linux policy:              111442555666

•

First policy:

111422333666

• Last policy:

144442555666

The aforementioned model was used for testing IPv6 Fragmentation against our targets. For each

fragment, the following payloads where used:

fragment 1 = "AABBCCDD"

fragment 2 = "BBAACCDD"

fragment 3 = "CCAABBDD"

fragment 4 = "DDAABBCC"

fragment 5 = "AACCBBDD"

fragment 6 = "AADDBBCC"

The PoC code can be found in Appendix A (subsection 7.2) The tests showed that:

•

FreeBSD, Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 are immune to these attacks.

• Ubuntu 10.04 and OpenBSD 5 (figure 11) are susceptible to these attacks.

Figure 11: The OpenBSD response to the Paxson/Shankar fragmentation.

The received ICMPv6 EchoReply from OpenBSD (figure 11) shows that the target performed

the following reassembly, which corresponds to the BSD reassembly policy.

Frag1 Frag1 Frag1 Frag4 Frag4 Frag2 Frag3 Frag3 Frag3 Frag6 Frag6 Frag6

The Ubuntu 10.04 response is given in figure 13.

The received ICMPv6 EchoReply shows that the target performed the following reassembly,

which corresponds to the Linux reassembly policy:

Frag1 Frag1 Frag1 Frag4 Frag4 Frag2 Frag5 Frag5 Frag5 Frag6 Frag6 Frag6

Figure 14: Ubuntu 10.04 response - Linux reassembly policy to the Paxson/Shankar fragmentation.

The experiments using the Paxson/Shankar fragmentation model showed again that only Ubuntu
10.04 and OpenBSD are susceptible to these attacks. They also showed that these two OS continue
to follow the well-known reassembly models, the Linux and the BSD ones respectively, known
from the corresponding “old” IPv4 tests.

5.4 Varying Independently the Overlapping Offset

The   initial   tests,   which   were   based   on   the   Paxson/Shankar   Model,   showed   that   from   the
examined systems, only  Ubuntu 10.04 and OpenBSD 5 are susceptible to the tested overlapping
attacks. Hence, it seems that the rest of the tested OS, FreeBSD 8.2/9, Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7
handle fragmentation overlapping issues properly. To verify if this is really the case, we performed

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

some additional simple but independent tests, by varying the offset and the size of the overlapping
fragment, as well as the value of the 'M' (“more fragment”) flag. To this end, the following model
was used.

•

For each test, three fragments were used.

• The first fragment, has an offset equals to zero, it has a constant length, it carries the
ICMPv6 header as well as a part of the payload, while the the M flag was always set to 1
(otherwise, this would also be the last fragment, which has no point obviously).

• The third (last) fragment has also a constant length, carries a part of the payload, the M
flag is always set to 0 (to finish the expectation of more fragments by the receiver),
while each offset is equal to the size of the first fragment.

• The second fragment has a variable length and offset, while for each one of the tested

scenarios, the 'M' flag was set to either both 0 or1.

In a nutshell, this model is presented in figure 15.

offset

All the tested scenarios can be found at the left-most column of each one of the Tables 1.a-1.e.
Taking into account the results up to now, we should expect that no new issues would arise, since
they are covered from the Paxson-Shankar model. However, as it will be shown, this is not case.

The corresponding results for each one of the tested OS are showed in tables 1.a to 1.e, both for
M=0 (at the top of each cell) and M=1 (at the bottom of the same cell). At the right-most column,
each of the scenarios has been numbered. The PoC code which can be used to reproduce the results
can be found in Appendix A (subsection 7.3). The numbers at the top of each one of the left-most
column are the values of the parameters that can be used as input to this code to reproduce the
results. These numbers corresponds:

•

•

•

the   first   one,   to   the   length   of   fragments   1   and   3   –   in   octets   of   bytes   (noted   as
<length_1_3> in the example that follows).

the second one, to the offset of fragment 2 (noted as  <offset_2>  in the example that
follows).

the third one, to the  difference of the length of fragment 2 with the ones of fragments 1
and 3 (in octets of bytes too) – noted as <dlength_of_fragment_2> in the example that
follows. Obviously, this value can be positive (implying that fragment 2 is bigger than
the ones of 1 and 3) or negative.

Specifically, the PoC code of subsection 7.3 should be used as following:

Antonios Atlasis, antonios.atlasis@cscss.org

 ./3-packet-fragmentation.py <source_IPv6_address> <destination_ipv6_address>  <order>
<M_value> <length_1_3> <offset_2> <dlength_of_fragment_2>

where:

•

•

the <order> denotes the sending order and can be normal or reverse,

the <M_value> is the value of the M flag of the extension header of the 2nd fragment, and
can be set or noset.

From the displayed results in Table 1 for each one of the tested OS, the feedback received in the
cases 2, 3 and 6 for M=0 is actually normal (because the second fragment, which is marked as the
last one with the M flag not set, it does not overlap with the first). Hence, these cases are ignored in
our comments for all the tested OS.

The conclusions drawn from the results for each one of the tested OS, are summarised in the next

subsections.

5.4.1 Ubuntu 10.04 (table 1.a)

Checking closely the  corresponding table, we infer  that  Ubuntu  10.04 generally follows  the
Linux policy. Specifically, the subsequent fragment is favoured, except when the original fragment
begins before, or begins the same and ends after the subsequent fragment. However, as we can
notice, the non-favoured packets are not discarded completely, but only their part that has been
overlapped is trimmed. Hence, there are cases like the no 4 one when M=1, where the 1 st octet of
fragment 2 is trimmed due to the overlapping by the previous fragment which begins before, and
the rest of the octets of fragment 2 are trimmed because they are completely overlapped by the
subsequent fragment. Similar are the cases of 5 and 8 when M=1.

In the aforementioned reassembly policy it seems that there is an exception though. In the case
of no 10, where the offset of the second fragment is also 0 and M=1, the subsequent fragment is
favoured although the previous one (fragment 1) start the same and ends after fragment 2. This
special   case   probably   happens   when   the   subsequent   (overlapping)   fragment   has   also   an   offset
equals to 0.

Finally, two notable behaviours are the ones of cases no 9, 10 and 11, where M=0 and the offset
of the second fragments is 0. These are the so called atomic fragments. In these cases, we have two
separate responses from the target. That is because, while fragment 2 is favoured, since its offset is
zero and its M flag is not set, it constructs its own datagram. At the same time, fragment 1, which
remains,   constructs   a   separate   datagram   with   fragment   3.  Although   these   response   may   seem
natural, actually they aren't since fragments 2, which follows and overlaps fragment 1, should be
silently discarded (as the rest of the fragments should, previous and subsequent, regardless whether
they also overlap or not, according to RFC 5722).

5.4.2 Ubuntu 11.10 (table 1.b)

The only cases in which Ubuntu 11.10 sends ICMPv6 Echo Reply messages are the ones where
the 2nd  fragment, which overlaps with 1st one (or the 3rd too), is an atomic one (offset = 0 and M=0
too). In each one of these cases (9, 10 and 11), two Echo Replies are sent back, one for the atomic
fragment and one for the datagram constructed from fragments 1 and 3.

This is the exactly the same behaviour and issue with the ones described in the last paragraph of

subsection 5.4.1.

5.4.3 FreeBSD 8.2/9 (table 1.c)

Having a quick glance at the FreeBSD results and taking into account the number of the cases in
which it responds with an ICMPv6 Echo Reply message, we may infer that this may be the “worst”
behaviour from the tested OS. However, by checking more closely, we shall notice that FreeBSD
actually discards the overlapping fragment (as it should), although, on the other hand, it doesn't
discard the subsequent ones (as it also should, according to RFC5722). This is the reason why in
almost all the tested cases, fragments 1 and 3 are accepted (which do not overlap), while fragment
2, which overlaps either with fragment 1, 3 or both, is discarded. The only exception to this is when
fragment 2 overlaps only with fragment 3 (partially or completely) and its M flag is set (cases 2, 3
and 6). In these last cases, fragment 3 is discarded and since a fragment with M=0 is never received,
no response is received either. On the contrary, when fragment 2 overlaps with fragment 1, it is
discarded immediately irrespective of any subsequent overlapping with fragment 3. In all these
cases, since fragment 2 has been already discarded, fragment 3 is accepted and hence, a response is
received.

To sum up, FreeBSD discards any fragment that overlaps with a previous one, but it doesn't

discard this previous fragment, or any subsequent one.

5.4.4 OpenBSD 5 (table 1.d)

If we check closely the OpenBSD results, we will notice that it favours the original packet. Even
in the cases that we do not get back a response (3, 4, 6 and 7 for M=1), that is because  the second
fragment, which is not marked as the last one, completely overlaps the third (last) fragment and
hence, since OpenBSD favours the original one, a fragment with an M=0 is actually never accepted
from the OS.

As in the case of Ubuntu 10.04, the overlapped packets are not completely overwritten, but their
corresponding parts are trimmed. Unlike Ubuntu 10.04 case though, in this case we do not have
special cases for atomic fragments (since original ones are generally favoured).

5.4.5 Windows 7 (table 1.e)

Checking the corresponding results, we can infer that Windows 7 responds with an ICMPv6
Echo Reply message only in three cases (cases 1, 11 and 12 for M=1). These are when the second
fragment overlaps only with the first one, partially or completely, but without exceeding the last
byte of the first offset.

Hence, It seems that Windows 7 comply with RFC 5722 (discarding all the fragments, when

overlapping occurs), unless only the 1st fragment is overlapped.

5.5 Varying Independently the Overlapping Offset and Reversing the

Arrival Order

The   next   experiment   was   to   repeat   the   previous   results   but   with  reversing   the   order   of   the
sending fragments (the green fragment first, then the blue and finally the red one). However, since
the arrival order of the fragments shouldn't matter regarding the reassembly, in this scenario we
shouldn't expect anything new but the repeat of the previous results. As the results showed, although
in their vast majority the previous observations were repeated, there were also some discrepancies
from them. Since Ubuntu 10.04 and OpenBSD 5 were very willing to accept overlapping fragments
anyway,   and   FreeBSD   rejected   any   overlapping   fragments   but   not   any   subsequent   ones   (an
observation which is  also repeated here), in table 2 we only concentrate on Ubuntu 11.10 and
Windows 7 results.

Checking table 2.a, we can see that by sending the fragments in exactly the reverse order, we

get more responses than sending them in a normal order. If we discard case number 9 for M=1
(which can be considered as normal), we can distinguish three distinct behaviours:

• The cases of 9, 10 and 11 for M=0, which are the cases of the atomic fragments where

two responses are received (similarly to the normal sending order).

• The other cases (1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 for M=1) where the overlapping fragment is discarded (a

behaviour that reminds the FreeBSD one).

• When fragment 2 ends after fragment 3 (cases 6 and 7) and M=1, we also get a response

by discarding the overlapping fragment 2

The only cases that we do not get any response is when the fragment 2 ends exactly at the same

offset with fragment 3 (cases 3 and 4).

Regarding Windows 7 (table 2.b), there are two cases where this OS responds; that is when
fragments 2 and 3 completely and exactly overlap, regardless if the M flag of the 2 nd fragment is
set or not, in which cases Windows 7 considers them probably as repeated packets.

5.6 Fragmentation Overlapping Sending Double Packets

If we vary even more the fragmentation pattern, we may be able to trigger some more responses.

An example is given in figure 16.  Specifically, in this case:

a) At first, the initial fragment is sent, which includes the ICMPv6 Echo Request Header plus a

payload.

b) Then, the 2nd fragment is sent, with an additional IPv6 payload and an offset greater than 0
(but less than the correct one). At this step, the receiver should have already discarded all the
fragments and any subsequent of this specific datagram, according to RFC 5722.

c) Then, this same 2nd fragment is re-sent but this time with the correct offset (equal to the length

of the 1st fragment).

d) Finally, the 1st fragment (0 offset) is sent again.

The PoC code of this attack can be found in subsection 7.4.

Figure 16: Fragmentation Overlapping Sending Double Packets

The experiment in this case showed that:

a) Ubuntu 10.04 and OpenBSD 5 sent two responses back (one for the overlapping fragments
(packets numbered 1 and 2 and one for the packets numbered 3 and 4). This should be expected

since, as we saw from the previous tests, these OS accept overlapping fragments.

b) Ubuntu 11.10, the two FreeBSDs and Windows 7 sent back one response. However:

(1) The two FreeBSDs sent back a response even if the packet numbered 4 is not sent,

showing again that they just discard the overlapping fragment (number 2).

(2) Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 did send a response only if all the four packets are sent

(including the last one, with the 0 offset).

(3) If the packet numbered 1 is not sent, none of the last three OS sends back a response.

Especially in the cases of Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 the reader may wonder if this behaviour
is normal since they actually seem to accept the last two packets. However, as RFC 5722 clearly
states,  when   reassembling   an   IPv6   datagram,   if   one   or   more   of   its   constituent   fragments   is
determined to be an overlapping fragment, the entire datagram (and any constituent fragments,
including those not yet received) must be silently discarded.  Hence, none of the tested OS can be
considered as an RFC compliant one.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, it was shown that fragmentation issues still remain in IPv6 implementation of some
of the most popular Operating Systems. The two tested Linux distros (Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.10), the
two newest FreeBSD, the latest OpenBSD and Windows 7 were all proven to be susceptible at least
to some of the fragmentation attacks. The results can be summarised as following:

• All the tested OS accepted really tiny fragments (e.g. one octet long) which, under specific
circumstances   (i.e.   when   deep-packet   inspection   is   not   performed)   and   especially   when
combined with the use of other IPv6 extension headers, can lead to firewall evasion.

• None of the tested OS is fully RFC compliant.

• Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (using linux kernel 2.6.32) and OpenBSD 5 were proven to be the most
susceptible to fragmentation overlapping attacks among the tested OS, each one following
the corresponding well-known reassembly policy (Linux and BSD respectively).

•

FreeBSD 8.2/9 discard any overlapping fragments, having the most consistent behaviour
among the tested OS. Although this is a very good practice, it does not fully comply with
RFC 5722 which suggest the rejection of any constituent  fragments too (including the ones
not yet received). Such a policy would not be an issue if the other OS followed this same
policy.

• The two Ubuntu send two responses when atomic fragments overlap with non-atomic ones.

• The behaviour of Ubuntu 11.10 seems to deteriorate significantly when the sending order of

the fragments is reversed.

• Windows 7, although seem to have the fewer issues, there are cases that they also accept

overlapping fragments.

All the aforementioned issues are mainly because the tested OS do not comply (either partially
or completely) with the corresponding RFCs and their recommendations concerning the handling of
fragmented IPv6 packets. The impact of these issues, since the behaviour varies between the tested
OS, starts from OS fingerprinting and can be extended, if used properly, to IDS insertion / evasion
and in some cases, even to firewall evasions. Further research on this field may show that similar
issues exist to other OS or at least, to flavours / distros of the same OS families. More extensive
research and fully RFC compliance is needed to ensure that IPv6 fragmentation is handled properly
and no similar issues will arise when IPv6 will finally be fully deployed.
