  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-4543",
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way:\n\n1) 'displayCRL' script of Certificate System sanitized content of 'pageStart' and 'pageSize' variables provided in the query string,\n2) 'profileProcess' script of Certificate System sanitized content of 'nonce' variable provided in the query string.\n\nA remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page that, when visited by an unsuspecting Certificate System user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of Certificate System user session.",
    "root_cause": "The 'displayCRL' and 'profileProcess' scripts in Certificate System did not properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, the 'pageStart', 'pageSize', and 'nonce' variables).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could inject arbitrary HTML or web scripts into the Certificate System user's session, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker can craft a malicious webpage containing the vulnerable scripts.",
         "The user needs to visit the malicious crafted web page while logged in to the Certificate System."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft a malicious web page and entice a user to visit it while logged into the Certificate System."
