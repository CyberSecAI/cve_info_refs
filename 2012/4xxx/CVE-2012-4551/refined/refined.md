Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-4551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error.
- Specifically, the `libunity-webapps` library was storing pointers to `UnityWebappsLocalAvailableApplication` objects in a hash table (`applications_by_name`) without properly maintaining a reference count.
- When a webapp was replaced in the hash table, the old `UnityWebappsLocalAvailableApplication` object was being freed (unref'd) without removing all references to it, leading to a dangling pointer. Later access to this dangling pointer resulted in the use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Improper object management in hash table.
- Lack of proper reference counting when dealing with objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, although not explicitly confirmed in all reports.
- Browser crashes in applications like Firefox when they use the vulnerable library.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A remote attacker could trigger this flaw by opening a malicious website, or by using a malicious webapp.
- The vulnerability could be triggered through normal usage, such as opening a google calendar invite or accessing a web app.
-  The vulnerability exists in the handling of certain hash tables within the `libunity-webapps` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the application that uses `libunity-webapps` to load a malicious website or webapp that will trigger the use after free.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was triggered in the function `unity_webapps_available_application_get_application_domain` in `unity-webapps-available-application.c`.
- The fix involved modifying `unity-webapps-application-repository.c` to properly store object references using `g_object_ref`.
- The bug was initially reported as causing crashes in Firefox, specifically mentioning "gmail integration", "opening a google calendar invite link from thunderbird", and "opening facebook".
- The issue was resolved in `libunity-webapps` version `2.4.1-0ubuntu3.2`.
