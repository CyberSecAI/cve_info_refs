How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Summary

Long request parameter names might significantly promote the effectiveness of DOS attacks

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Denial-of-Service attacks |
| Maximum security rating | Important |
| Recommendation | Developers should upgrade to [Struts 2.3.4.1](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2341) |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.3.4 |
| Original JIRA Tickets | [WW-3860](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3860) |
| Reporter | Johno Crawford |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2012-4387 |

## Problem

Request parameters handled by Struts 2 are effectively treated as OGNL expressions. A possible DOS attacker might craft requests to a Struts 2 based application with extremely long parameter names. OGNL evaluation of the parameter name then will consume significant CPU cycles, thus promoting the effectiveness of the DOS attack.

## Solution

As of Struts 2.3.4.1, parameter name length is limited to a maximum of 100 characters. This configuration may be customized by providing the newly introduced parameter "paramNameMaxLength" to the ParametersInteceptor configuration.

Thanks to Johno Crawford for the provided patch.

Please upgrade to [Struts 2.3.4.1](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2341).

Yes, confirmed struts 2.3.4.1 was released August 11, 2012.

====

> [1] <http://struts.apache.org/2.x/docs/s2-010.html>

When using Struts 2 token mechanism for CSRF protection, token check
may be bypassed by misusing known session attributes

Please use CVE-2012-4386 for this issue.

====

> [2] <http://struts.apache.org/2.x/docs/s2-011.html>

Long request parameter names might significantly promote the
effectiveness of DOS attacks

Please use CVE-2012-4387 for this issue.

These don't appear to affect struts 1.2.x/1.3.x.
