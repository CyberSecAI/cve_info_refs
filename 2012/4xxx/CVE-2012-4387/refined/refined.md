Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from how Apache Struts 2 handles request parameters. The framework treats these parameters as OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions. This allows an attacker to craft requests with extremely long parameter names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Unrestricted Parameter Name Length**: Struts 2 did not limit the length of request parameter names.
-   **OGNL Expression Evaluation**: The framework's evaluation of parameter names as OGNL expressions makes it computationally expensive to process very long names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending requests with extremely long parameter names, an attacker can force the server to spend significant CPU cycles evaluating these names, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests that include unusually long parameter names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Struts 2 application.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require the attacker to be authenticated.
-   **Knowledge of OGNL**: The attacker does not need to be aware of OGNL or its specifics, only that the application handles input parameters as OGNL expressions and is vulnerable to long parameter names.

**Additional Details:**
-   The fix implemented in Struts 2.3.4.1 limits parameter name length to a maximum of 100 characters, configurable via the `paramNameMaxLength` parameter in the ParametersInterceptor configuration.
-   The vulnerability was reported by Johno Crawford.
-   The vulnerability was tracked as JIRA issue WW-3860.
