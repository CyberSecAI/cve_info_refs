Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2012-4927 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** LimeSurvey (PHPSurveyor 1.91+ stable, tested on version 1.91+ build 11804)
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that session variables can be freely manipulated. Specifically, the `save.php` script (line 82) uses user-supplied POST data (`$pf`) to directly set session variables (`$_SESSION[$pf] = $_POST[$pf]`). When the 'srid' POST variable is set, and its value is also present in the 'fieldnames' POST variable, this allows for SQL injection via the `createinsertquery()` function.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker crafts malicious POST requests when answering a survey (`index.php`).
    *   The attacker manipulates the 'fieldnames' and 'srid' POST variables to inject SQL code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can perform blind SQL injection. This allows them to potentially extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames) by crafting SQL queries that use `SLEEP()` or similar functions to infer information based on the server's response time.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to submit POST requests to the LimeSurvey application. They must also be able to analyze the application's responses (e.g., response time) to infer the results of the injected SQL queries.
*   **Example:** The provided exploit code shows how to inject SQL code to guess the username from the `lime_users` table.

    ```
    fieldnames=...%7C17165X6X18SQ001` = NULL WHERE id=6 AND id IN ( SELECT IF ( (SELECT SUBSTRING(users_name,1) FROM lime_users WHERE uid=1) LIKE 'a%', 1, SLEEP(5)))--%7Csrid
    srid=42
    ```

    In this example, the attacker is attempting to determine if the first letter of the username of the user with `uid=1` is 'a'. If it is, the `IF` condition evaluates to 1, otherwise, the `SLEEP(5)` function is called, causing the server to pause for 5 seconds. By observing the response time, the attacker can infer whether the condition is true or false.
