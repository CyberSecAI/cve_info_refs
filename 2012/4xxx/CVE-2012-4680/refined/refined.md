  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2012-4680": {
      "root_cause": "The IOServer OPC Server application's built-in web server does not properly handle pathnames, and the application stores sensitive data under the Web document root with insufficient access control.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient Access Controls (CWE-219): Sensitive data is stored under the web document root with insufficient access controls.",
        "Directory Listing (CWE-538): The web server allows directory listings in some cases.",

        "Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to the built-in web server."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker with low skill can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server."
