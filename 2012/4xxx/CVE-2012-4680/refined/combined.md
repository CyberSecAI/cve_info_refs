ICS Advisory
# IOServer OPC Server Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedMay 01, 2013
Alert CodeICSA-12-258-01

## Overview

Independent researcher Hinge of foofus.net has identified multiple vulnerabilitiesIOServer “Root Directory” Trailing Backslash Web Server Vuln, http://www.foofus.net/?page\_id=616, Web site last accessed September 13, 2012. in IOServer’s OPC Server application. IOServer has released a new version of the product that partially mitigates these vulnerabilities. Hinge has tested the new version and found that it partially resolves these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.

## Affected Products

The following IOServer OPC Server versions are affected:

* IOServer OPC Server 1.0.18.0 and earlier.

## Impact

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to download any file on the file system without authentication.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## Background

IOServer is an Australia-based company that produces the affected product, OPC Server, which is designed to exchange data between the human-machine interface and the programmable logic controllers. According to IOServer, OPC Server is deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, building automation, oil and gas, and electric utilities. IOServer estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.

## Vulnerability Characterization

### Vulnerability Overview

CVE-2012-4680NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4680, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to these three closely related vulnerabilities. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)).

#### Insufficient Access ControlsCWE-219: Sensitive Data Under Web Root, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/219.html, Web site last accessed September 13, 2012.

The application stores sensitive data under the Web document root with insufficient access control, which might make it accessible to unauthorized parties.

#### Directory ListingCWE-538: File and Directory Information Exposure, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/538.html, Web site last accessed September 13, 2012.

The product stores sensitive information in files or directories that are accessible to actors outside of the intended control sphere.

#### Directory TraversalCWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html, Web site last accessed September 13, 2012.

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. However, the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. This allows arbitrary access to any file on the server.

### Vulnerability Details

#### Exploitability

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### Existence of Exploit

Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.

#### Difficulty

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation

IOServer has created a new version (Version 1.0.19.0IOServer version 1.0.19.0, http://www.ioserver.com/driver19.exe, Web site last accessed September 13, 2012.) to correct the directory traversal vulnerability (Vulnerability #3 above). The researcher has found that this new version still contains insufficient access controls (Vulnerability #1) and allows directory listings (Vulnerability #2) inside the root directory and its subdirectories.

In addition to the patch, the researcher recommends that users ensure that the “Root Directory” configuration value has a trailing backslash. This helps to mitigate the remaining issues, although an attacker can still get a directory listing of the root directory itself (but not subdirectories) with this in place.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [*Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies*](/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html). ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01A—Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/control_systems/pdf/ICS-TIP-12-146-01A.pdf).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

## IOServer “Root Directory” Trailing Backslash Web Server Vuln

=====================================================================

BEGIN Foofus.net Security Advisory: foofus-20120817 BEGIN

=====================================================================

Title: IOServer “Root Directory” Trailing Backslash Web Server Vuln

Allows: Arbitrary File Access, Directory Listing, Directory Traversal

CVSS Base / Temporal / Overall Scores: 7.8 / 6.4 / 6.4

Advisory Version: 2 (first publicly released version is 2)

Advisory Release Date: 2012-08-17

Advisory Last Updated: 2012-08-17

Vendor: IOServer Pty Ltd. http://www.ioserver.com/

Affected Product: IOServer 1.0.18.0 (and earlier?)

Issue Status: fixed version and workarounds available

Link: http://www.foofus.net/?page\_id=616

=====================================================================

1. Summary

== =======

IOServer is a piece of industrial control software that runs on Windows. It contains a built-in web server to support the “XML Server” feature. This web server can be abused to download any file on the file system without authentication, if the “Root Directory” setting does not contain a trailing backslash. Note that a sample configuration provided with the product exhibits a vulnerable configuration.

2. Description

== ===========

The vendor’s web site describes IOServer thusly:

“OPC (OLE for Process Control) Server for Windows NT 4.0 / 95 / 98 / ME / 2000 / 2003 / XP / 2008 / 7. Interface to multiple protocols through a single OPC Server. This software allows OPC clients such as HMI (Human Machine Interface) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to exchange plant floor data with PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers).”

If the “XML Server” feature is turned on (apparently by configuring a valid “Root Directory” on the “XML Server” tab), the integrated web server listens on the configured port (81 by default). If the “Root Directory” configuration value does not contain a trailing backslash, then these issues exist.

A directory traversal vulnerability exists such that the web server can be tricked to serve up any file on the server, outside of the configured “Root Directory”. On Windows, one common thing to do with an issue like this is to download the backup copy of the SAM, in order to retrieve password hashes and mount an offline attack on them. Any other potentially sensitive file on the server can be accessed this way as well, if the attacker knows the path to it.

Note that directory traversal is only needed if you want to break out of the “Root Directory”. The web server will serve up files inside the “Root Directory” just by asking it for them. This may or may not be considered a vulnerability, depending on the expectations of the administrator.

Also, the web server allows directory listings in some cases, whether inside or outside the “Root Directory”. Again, this may or may not be considered a vulnerability depending on expectations.

Note also that the “XML Server Settings” tab contains fields for a “Read Password” and “Write Password”, which are apparently intended to only restrict access to the devices via the XML web interface (they are not intended to restrict access to other content served by the web server). By default, they are set to blank. But due to their intended use of resticting device access, they do nothing to stop access to the file system as described here even if they are set to some value.

3. Proof of Concept / Steps to Reproduce

== ===== == ======= = ===== == =========

Install the software and use the sample Modbus Web Server configuration from http://www.ioserver.com/mbtcp.io to get it working. This sample configuration uses the “Root Directory” value of “C:Program FilesIOServerDocs” (note the lack of a trailing backslash). This directory does not exist unless you install the documentation package (isodoc.exe, available from the vendor web site). You can get to a vulnerable configuration if you leave the “Root Directory” alone and install the documentation package, or just modify the “Root “Directory” value to something valid (but lacking a trailing backslash) like “C:Program FilesIOServer”. Note that the software or server may need to be restarted, then you will see a web server listening on the configured port (81 by default).

Note that more recent versions of the software default to “C:IOServer” rather than “C:Program FilesIOServer”. This does not affect the issues discussed here.

To request files within the “Root Directory”, just ask for them with a browser or command-line tool like wget:

wget http://target-server:81/modbus.dll

To get a directory listing, just ask:

wget http://target-server:81/

To request files outside of the “Root Directory”, use a standard directory traversal trick with a client or browser that supports it. Note that IE probably will not allow this type of malfeasance:

wget http://target-server:81/…/…/…/windows/repair/sam

To get a directory listing outside of the “Root Directory”, ask for it with the directory traversal trick:

wget http://target-server:81/…/…/…/windows/

Note that it is only this directory traversal issue that was fixed in version 1.0.19.0. Accessing files and directory listings inside the “Root Directory” is apparently intended operation.

4. Impact

== ======

Unexpected arbitrary access to the file system can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Worst case, disclosure of the system’s password hashes can lead to compromise of the passwords, and therefore, of the server.

5. CVSS Scoring

== ==== =======

Using http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2

CVSS Base Score: 7.8

Impact Subscore: 6.9

Exploitability Subscore: 10

CVSS Temporal Score: 6.4

Overall CVSS Score: 6.4

Access Vector: Network

Access Complexity: Low

Authentication: None

Confidentiality Impact: Complete

Integrity Impact: None

Availability Impact: None

Exploitability: Functional exploit exists

Remediation Level: Official fix

Report Confidence: Confirmed

Note that the CVSS calculation was based only on the directory traversal issue, since it is the most obvious and serious vulnerability addressed here.

6. Affected Products

== ======== ========

IOServer 1.0.18.0 (earlier versions are also assumed vulnerable)

This was downloaded from http://www.ioserver.com/driver18.exe, which was the current version as of 23 April 2012. Older versions were not available, but are assumed vulnerable.

(you can check your version in the IOServer GUI using Help, About IOServer)

7. Workarounds / Solutions

== =========== = =========

Ensure that the “Root Directory” value has a trailing backslash. This eliminates most of the issues, although you can still get a directory listing of the “Root Directory” itself (but not subdirs) even with this in place.

Of course, limit access to the web server port to only trusted hosts/networks. Even a fixed version should probably not be exposed to the Internet or other untrusted networks.

The directory traversal issue was fixed in version 1.0.19.0 (http://www.ioserver.com/driver19.exe), released on 2012-06-20. However, arbitrary file access and directory listings inside the “Root Directory” and its subdirs are still possible in this version, unless the trailing backslash is in place. Note that even with the trailing backslash, directory listing of the “Root Directory” itself is still possible.

It is recommended that all three of the above actions (use the trailing backslash, limit access to trusted networks/hosts only, and upgrade to 1.0.19.0 or later) be taken in order to secure this web server as much as possible.

8. Timeline

== ========

2012-04-23: First vendor contact

2012-04-23: Vendor sends proposed fix (that was fast!)

2012-04-27: Proposed fix found incomplete, feedback to vendor

2012-05-04: Vendor sends second proposed fix

2012-05-17: Verified that second proposed fix resolves all known directory traversal issues

2012-05-17: Vendor informs that directory listing and arbitrary file access issues inside the Root Directory are intended functionality

2012-05-18: This issue put on the back burner due to urgent project; I then completely forget about it (oops, my bad)

2012-06-20: Vendor releases fixed version (1.0.19.0, aka “driver19.exe”)

2012-08-08: I remember about this; recheck all information and retest current version 1.0.19.0; edits to advisory; contact vendor about public release date

2012-08-17: Public release

9. Credit

== ======

hinge, hinge@foofus.net

Well, actually, this vulnerability was found by Nessus, plugin ID 10297 (which looks for generic web server directory traversal issues, not specific to IOServer of course). All I did was see it in the scan results, verify it, reproduce it for testing, report it to the vendor and write this advisory.

Thanks to my friends at foofus.net, and to IOServer for being very responsive and open.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
