The provided content is related to **PMASA-2012-4**, which is associated with multiple XSS vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin and is not related to CVE-2012-4579.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of crafted table names and data when displayed in various phpMyAdmin pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in several phpMyAdmin pages:
1. Database Structure page when creating a new table with a crafted name.
2. Database Structure page, using the Empty and Drop links of a crafted table name.
3. Table Operations page, using 'Empty the table (TRUNCATE)' and 'Delete the table (DROP)' links for a crafted table.
4. Triggers page of a database with crafted table names, when opening the 'Add Trigger' popup.
5. When creating a trigger for a table with a crafted name and an invalid definition.
6. When visualizing GIS data with a crafted label name in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves creating database tables or inserting data with maliciously crafted names and labels containing JavaScript code. This requires the attacker to have some level of access to the database and the ability to create or modify database content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to create tables or insert data within a database accessible by phpMyAdmin. The attacker also needs to have some knowledge of SQL and phpMyAdmin to craft a malicious payload. An attacker would likely need to be a database user.
