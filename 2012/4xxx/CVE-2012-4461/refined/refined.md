Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4461:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. Specifically, it arises from how KVM handles the `X86_CR4_OSXSAVE` bit in the `vcpu->arch.cr4` register when a guest virtual CPU (vcpu) enters execution. The `X86_CR4_OSXSAVE` bit is related to the XSAVE CPU feature, used for saving and restoring extended processor states.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the `X86_CR4_OSXSAVE` bit on host systems that do *not* support the XSAVE feature. When a guest attempts to use this feature (by setting the bit), the hypervisor fails to process it correctly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash/denial of service. An unprivileged local user in the guest system could cause the host to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local privilege escalation. By setting the X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit in the guest OS, which is not supported by the host CPU, the host will crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unprivileged local user access to a guest virtual machine running on a vulnerable host.

**Technical details and descriptions**
- The issue arises specifically when the host does not have the XSAVE CPU feature but the guest OS attempts to use it.
- The vulnerable code is within KVM, specifically during guest entry.
- The fix involves masking out the `X86_FEATURE_XSAVE` at guest creation if the host does not support it and making `kvm_set_cr4` with `X86_CR4_OSXSAVE` fail.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and other systems using the vulnerable kernel.
- The fix for this issue was publicly available before the patch was released in various distributions and upstream.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Jon Howell.
- Multiple sources confirm the nature of the vulnerability as a denial-of-service.
