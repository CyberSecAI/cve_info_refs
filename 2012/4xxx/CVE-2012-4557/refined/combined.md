# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.34

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### important: mod\_ssl Null Pointer Dereference ([CVE-2017-3169](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3169))

mod\_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call ap\_hook\_process\_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port.

### important: ap\_find\_token() Buffer Overread ([CVE-2017-7668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7668))

The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap\_find\_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap\_find\_token() to return an incorrect value.

### important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod\_auth\_digest ([CVE-2017-9788](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788))

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Dominic Scheirlinck and Scott Geary of Vend for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### moderate: mod\_proxy crash ([CVE-2007-3847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3847))

A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.

httpd-2.2.x-bnc777260-CVE-2012-2687-mod\_negotiation\_filename
\_xss.diff Escape filename for the case that uploads are
allowed with untrusted user's control over filenames and
mod\_negotiation enabled on the same directory.
CVE-2012-2687 [bnc#777260]
- httpd-2.2.x-CVE-2011-3368\_CVE-2011-4317-bnc722545.diff
reworked to reflect the upstream changes. This will
prevent the "Invalid URI in request OPTIONS \*" messages
in the error log. [bnc#722545]
- /etc/init.d/apache2: new argument "check-reload". Exits 1
if httpd2 runs on deleted binaries such as after package
update, else 0. This is used by equally modified
/etc/logrotate.d/apache2, which uses "/etc/init.d/apache2
check-reload" in its prerotate script. These changes
prevent httpd2 from being (gracefully) reloaded by
logrotate, executed by cron, if new binaries have been
installed. Instead, a warning is printed on stdout and is
being logged to the syslogs. If this happens, apache's
logs are NOT rotated, and the running processes are left
untouched. This limits the maximum damage of log rotation
to unrotated logs. "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart" (or
"rcapache2 restart") must be executed manually in such a
case. [bnc#728876]

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : Multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4557 CVE-2012-4929
Debian Bug     : 689936

A vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2012-4557

	A flaw was found when mod_proxy_ajp connects to a backend
	server that takes too long to respond. Given a specific
	configuration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,
	putting a backend server into an error state until the retry
	timeout expired. This could lead to a temporary denial of
	service.

In addition, this update also adds a server side mitigation for the
following issue:

CVE-2012-4929

	If using SSL/TLS data compression with HTTPS in an connection
	to a web browser, man-in-the-middle attackers may obtain
	plaintext HTTP headers. This issue is known as the "CRIME"
	attack. This update of apache2 disables SSL compression by
	default. A new SSLCompression directive has been backported
	that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in
	environments where the "CRIME" attack is not an issue.
	For more information, please refer to:
	<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression>

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze10.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c0)  David Jorm    2012-10-31 03:54:13 UTC  ``` When mod_proxy_ajp sends a request to a worker node and the time to process that request exceeds the configured timeout, the worker node will be marked as in the error state, stopping all traffic to the node until it is flagged as up again. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger a temporary denial of service attack, provided they were able to create a request that caused sufficient processing time to exceed the timeout threshold.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-31 08:12:31 UTC  ``` References:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1227298> <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html#2.2.22>  According to upstream security page, this affected versions 2.2.12 - 2.2.21.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-31 15:50:09 UTC  ``` This issue affected the version of the httpd package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  The httpd version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 was not affected.  --  This issue affected the version of the httpd package as shipped with JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1, but it was already corrected in version 1.0.2.  --  The httpd packages in current Fedora versions (F16 and F17) already contain fixed upstream version.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-31 16:52:36 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c7)  David Jorm    2012-11-05 04:48:39 UTC  ``` This flaw was previously fixed in JBoss Enterprise Web Server (EWS) 1.0.2:  <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODCLUSTER-226>  The fix is incorporated via httpd-MODCLUSTER-226.patch.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-07 09:48:15 UTC  ``` This issue is relevant when proxy_ajp is used with proxy balancer.  This may allow attacker able to trigger the timeout to cause balancer to treat backend servers as failed, causing it to stop forwarding requests to those servers until the recovery timeout elapses.  As a consequence, all traffic can be sent to a single backend, degrading performance of the load balanced web site.  If all backend servers are put into an error state, httpd version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will move one backend from the error state, so normal requests can still be served.  The balancer behavior in httpd version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is different.  Backend error states are cleared with each request to balancer.  Hence this bug has no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c10)  William Lovaton    2013-01-04 22:56:51 UTC  ``` Hi Tomas, would you think this could happen with mod_proxy_http too? I'm experiencing a similar problem you describe in [comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c9) but I'm balancing through http not ajp.  It can take several days to appear, everything is working fine when all of a sudden the balancer-manager page shows that the workers lost the routes and apache is only using one of the backends, I tried to readjust the configuration directly in the page but it doesn't work, I have to make a full restart (graceful doesn't work either).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 10:10:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0512 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0512.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-25 10:22:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c10)) > Hi Tomas, would you think this could happen with mod_proxy_http too? I'm > experiencing a similar problem you describe in [comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=871685#c9) but I'm balancing > through http not ajp.  From a quick test and look at the mod_proxy_http code, I see that timeout of the http requests leads to the "Error reading from remote server" error being sent to the client, without putting backend server to an error state. This mod_proxy_ajp fix makes it behave the same way.  Additionally, this problem is not persistent and the error state is cleared rather shortly.  It requires attacker to keep sending timing out request to make most backends in error state.   ``` |  |
