Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Novell ZENworks Asset Management 7.5 web console, specifically within the `Rtrlet` servlet. This servlet handles maintenance calls, and two of these calls, `GetFile_Password` and `GetConfigInfo_Password`, are protected by hardcoded credentials (`Ivanhoe/Scott`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of hardcoded credentials ("Ivanhoe/Scott") to access sensitive maintenance functions. This bypasses normal authentication mechanisms.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `GetFile_Password` function allows retrieval of any file from the server with SYSTEM privileges, while the `GetConfigInfo_Password` function exposes configuration parameters, including the backend database credentials in clear text.
*   **Lack of Proper Authentication and Authorization:**  The web console fails to implement proper authentication and authorization checks, relying instead on easily discoverable hardcoded credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can retrieve any file from the server's file system with SYSTEM privileges, potentially exposing sensitive data or system files.
*   **Credentials Theft:** An attacker can retrieve the ZENworks Asset Management configuration, including clear text database credentials.
*   **System Compromise:** With the ability to read arbitrary files and obtain database credentials, an attacker could further compromise the system and the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web console, making it accessible to remote attackers.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP POST requests to the `Rtrlet` servlet with the `maintenance` parameter set to either `GetFile_Password` or `GetConfigInfo_Password`, along with the hardcoded `username` and `password`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system running the vulnerable Novell ZENworks Asset Management 7.5 web console.
*   **Knowledge of the Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the hardcoded username ("Ivanhoe") and password ("Scott") to exploit the vulnerable maintenance calls.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes a detailed technical analysis of the vulnerable code, showing how the `HandleMaintenanceCalls` function processes the requests and checks the hardcoded credentials.
*   It also includes example HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerabilities, as well as information about the Metasploit modules created to automate the exploitation process.
*   Novell has released a patch to address this issue and provided instructions on how to apply the patch.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked as CVE-2012-4933, and CERT has also published a vulnerability note VU#332412 regarding this issue.
