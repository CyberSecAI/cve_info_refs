\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 47 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 1 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues and some bugs.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-74: CVE-2013-4553: The XEN\_DOMCTL\_getmemlist
hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does
not always obtain the page\_alloc\_lock and mm\_rwlock in the
same order, which allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host deadlock). (bnc#849667)
\*
XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\*
XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\*
XSA-66: CVE-2013-4361: The fbld instruction emulation
in Xen 3.3.x through 4.3.x does not use the correct
variable for the source effective address, which allows
local HVM guests to obtain hypervisor stack information by
reading the values used by the instruction. (bnc#841766)
\*
XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\*
XSA-62: CVE-2013-1442: Xen 4.0 through 4.3.x, when
using AVX or LWP capable CPUs, does not properly clear
previous data from registers when using an XSAVE or XRSTOR
to extend the state components of a saved or restored vCPU
after touching other restored extended registers, which
allows local guest OSes to obtain sensitive information by
reading the registers. (bnc#839596)
\*
XSA-61: CVE-2013-4329: The xenlight library (libxl)
in Xen 4.0.x through 4.2.x, when IOMMU is disabled,
provides access to a busmastering-capable PCI passthrough
device before the IOMMU setup is complete, which allows
local HVM guest domains to gain privileges or cause a
denial of service via a DMA instruction. (bnc#839618)
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1432: Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x, when the
XSA-45 patch is in place, does not properly maintain
references on pages stored for deferred cleanup, which
allows local PV guest kernels to cause a denial of service
(premature page free and hypervisor crash) or possible gain
privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-57: CVE-2013-2211: The libxenlight (libxl)
toolstack library in Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x uses weak
permissions for xenstore keys for paravirtualised and
emulated serial console devices, which allows local guest
administrators to modify the xenstore value via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#823608)
\*
XSA-56: CVE-2013-2072: Buffer overflow in the Python
bindings for the xc\_vcpu\_setaffinity call in Xen 4.0.x,
4.1.x, and 4.2.x allows local administrators with
permissions to configure VCPU affinity to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and xend toolstack crash) and
possibly gain privileges via a crafted cpumap. (bnc#819416)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-53: CVE-2013-2077: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x
does not properly restrict the contents of a XRSTOR, which
allows local PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(unhandled exception and hypervisor crash) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#820919)
\*
XSA-52: CVE-2013-2076: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x,
when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore the
FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine
portions of the state of floating point instructions of
other domains, which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive
information such as cryptographic keys, a similar
vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056. NOTE: this is the
documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is
inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant
fashion that was not addressed by the kernels. (bnc#820917)
\*
XSA-50: CVE-2013-1964: Xen 4.0.x and 4.1.x
incorrectly releases a grant reference when releasing a
non-v1, non-transitive grant, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (host crash),
obtain sensitive information, or possible have other
impacts via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816156)
\*
XSA-49: CVE-2013-1952: Xen 4.x, when using Intel VT-d
for a bus mastering capable PCI device, does not properly
check the source when accessing a bridge device's interrupt
remapping table entries for MSI interrupts, which allows
local guest domains to cause a denial of service (interrupt
injection) via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816163)
\*
XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\*
XSA-46: CVE-2013-1919: Xen 4.2.x and 4.1.x does not
properly restrict access to IRQs, which allows local stub
domain clients to gain access to IRQs and cause a denial of
service via vectors related to "passed-through IRQs or PCI
devices." (bnc#813675)
\*
XSA-45: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#816159)
\*
XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\*
XSA-41: CVE-2012-6075: Buffer overflow in the
e1000\_receive function in the e1000 device driver
(hw/e1000.c) in QEMU 1.3.0-rc2 and other versions, when the
SBP and LPE flags are disabled, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary guest code via a large packet.
(bnc#797523)
\*
XSA-37: CVE-2013-0154: The get\_page\_type function in
xen/arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.2, when debugging is enabled,
allows local PV or HVM guest administrators to cause a
denial of service (assertion failure and hypervisor crash)
via unspecified vectors related to a hypercall. (bnc#797031)
\*
XSA-36: CVE-2013-0153: The AMD IOMMU support in Xen
4.2.x, 4.1.x, 3.3, and other versions, when using AMD-Vi
for PCI passthrough, uses the same interrupt remapping
table for the host and all guests, which allows guests to
cause a denial of service by injecting an interrupt into
other guests. (bnc#800275)
\*
XSA-33: CVE-2012-5634: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 4.0,
when using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough, does not
properly configure VT-d when supporting a device that is
behind a legacy PCI Bridge, which allows local guests to
cause a denial of service to other guests by injecting an
interrupt. (bnc#794316)
\*
XSA-31: CVE-2012-5515: The (1)
XENMEM\_decrease\_reservation, (2) XENMEM\_populate\_physmap,
and (3) XENMEM\_exchange hypercalls in Xen 4.2 and earlier
allow local guest administrators to cause a denial of
service (long loop and hang) via a crafted extent\_order
value. (bnc#789950)
\*
XSA-30: CVE-2012-5514: The
guest\_physmap\_mark\_populate\_on\_demand function in Xen 4.2
and earlier does not properly unlock the subject GFNs when
checking if they are in use, which allows local guest HVM
administrators to cause a denial of service (hang) via
unspecified vectors. (bnc#789948)
\*
XSA-29: CVE-2012-5513: The XENMEM\_exchange handler in
Xen 4.2 and earlier does not properly check the memory
address, which allows local PV guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified vectors that overwrite memory in
the hypervisor reserved range. (bnc#789951)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-6333: Multiple HVM control
operations in Xen 3.4 through 4.2 allow local HVM guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (physical CPU
consumption) via a large input. (bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-5511: Stack-based buffer overflow in
the dirty video RAM tracking functionality in Xen 3.4
through 4.1 allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a large bitmap image.
(bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-26: CVE-2012-5510: Xen 4.x, when downgrading the
grant table version, does not properly remove the status
page from the tracking list when freeing the page, which
allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#789945)
\*
XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)
\*
XSA-24: CVE-2012-4539: Xen 4.0 through 4.2, when
running 32-bit x86 PV guests on 64-bit hypervisors, allows
local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and hang or crash) via invalid arguments to
GNTTABOP\_get\_status\_frames, aka "Grant table hypercall
infinite loop DoS vulnerability." (bnc#786520)
\*
XSA-23: CVE-2012-4538: The HVMOP\_pagetable\_dying
hypercall in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 does not properly check
the pagetable state when running on shadow pagetables,
which allows a local HVM guest OS to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#786519)
\*
XSA-22: CVE-2012-4537: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
the p2m and m2p tables when the set\_p2m\_entry function
fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption and assertion
failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability."
(bnc#786517)
\*
XSA-20: CVE-2012-4535: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and

Ahh I see the request now (it was in a different email folder). Please
use CVE-2012-4411 for this issue.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2543-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Raphael Geissert
September 08, 2012                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xen-qemu-dm-4.0
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3515 CVE-2012-4411

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xen-qemu-dm-4.0, the Xen
Qemu Device Model virtual machine hardware emulator. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-3515:

    The device model for HVM domains does not properly handle VT100
    escape sequences when emulating certain devices with a virtual
    console backend. An attacker within a guest with access to the
    vulnerable virtual console could overwrite memory of the device
    model and escalate privileges to that of the device model process.

CVE-2012-4411:

    The qemu monitor was enabled by default, allowing administrators of
    a guest to access resources of the host, possibly escalate privileges
    or access resources belonging to another guest.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-2+squeeze2.

The testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
no longer contain this package.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen-qemu-dm-4.0 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  A guest administrator who is granted access to the graphical console of a Xen guest can access the qemu monitor.  The monitor can be used to access host resources.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can access host resources (perhaps belonging to other guests or the underlying system) and may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Installations where guest administrators do not have access to a domain's graphical console, or containing only PV domains configured without a graphical console, are not vulnerable.  Installations where all guest administrators are trustworthy are not vulnerable, even if the guest operating systems themselves are untrusted.  Systems using xend/xm: At least all versions since Xen 4.0 are affected.  Systems are vulnerable even if "monitor=no" is specified in the xm domain configuration file - this configuration option is not properly honoured in the vulnerable versions.  Systems using libxl/xl: All versions are affected.  The "monitor=" option is not understood, and is therefore ignored, by xl.  However, systems using the experimental device model version based on upstream qemu are NOT vulnerable; that is, Xen 4.2 RC systems with device_model_version="qemu_xen" specified in the xl domain config file.  Systems using libvirt are vulnerable.  For "xen:" URIs, see xend/xm, above.  For "libxl:" URIs, all versions are affected.  Systems based on the Xen Cloud Platform are NOT vulnerable.  CONFIRMING VULNERABILITY ========================  Connect to the guest's VNC (or SDL) graphical display and make sure your focus is in that window.  Hold down CTRL and ALT and press 2. You will see a black screen showing one of "serial0", "parallel0" or "QEMU <version> monitor".  Repeat this exercise for other digits 3 to 6.  CTRL+ALT+1 is the domain's normal graphical console.  Not all numbers will have screens attached, but note that you must release and re-press CTRL and ALT each time.  If one of the accessible screens shows "QEMU <version> monitor" then you are vulnerable.  Otherwise you are not.  MITIGATION ==========  With xl in Xen 4.1 and later, supplying the following config option in the VM configuration file will disable the monitor:    device_model_args=["-monitor","null"]  With xend the following config option will disable the monitor:    monitor_path="null" Note that with a vulnerable version of the software specifying "monitor=0" will NOT disable the monitor.  We are not currently aware of the availability of mitigation for systems using libvirt.  NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO ======================  This issue was publicly discussed online by its discoverer. There is therefore no embargo.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached patch against qemu-xen-traditional (qemu-xen-4.*-testing.git) resolves this issue.  $ sha256sum xsa19-qemu-all.patch 19fc5ff9334e7e7ad429388850dc6e52e7062c21a677082e7a89c2f2c91365fa   xsa19-qemu-all.patch -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQSc6yAAoJEIP+FMlX6CvZ3MMIAJ3BfY4EXmye0ucZKU2zsrNx R9w3AXdZWywf9qWX9DvgnJ0r4v/1wukqYwqpShAYNRHnbc3M15/ipEyLZDS2L4I2 On2mcaQeFAx5xIesRAaggyr4mQLoafCZxQO1ADPEIoyX97BBCJB85AjY5ctuoRX7 vDIUCwcXENsSVoDu3jJxqwwvbLbR7CA//V6RmCCIV9JKqcAdnrCTbRnoC7auDBzq rbEqf9yyW2Md9Dul6S6j5RUim0CT7dJ7LlEbjRoyiDleHrK1T5UlfxHaCGhGa/ud YRkW34PogsB1/boOi6T03Eir7svNNfN46ZS8Y+Pf6Dkv765BabIKwhhl7idIDUM= =ayT8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  ```  **Attachment: [xsa19-qemu-all.patch](binWT3pnoXcIU.bin)** *Description:* Binary data  ``` _______________________________________________ Xen-announce mailing list Xen-announce@xxxxxxxxxxxxx <http://lists.xen.org/xen-announce> ```    ---      * Prev by Date:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 19 - guest administrator can access qemu monitor console](msg00007.html)** * Next by Date:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen 4.2.0 Released!](msg00009.html)** * Previous by thread:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 19 - guest administrator can access qemu monitor console](msg00007.html)** * Next by thread:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen 4.2.0 Released!](msg00009.html)** * Index(es):   + [**Date**](index.html#00008)   + [**Thread**](threads.html#00008) |

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 19 - guest administrator can access qemu
 monitor console

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

                 Xen Security Advisory XSA-19

         guest administrator can access qemu monitor console

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

A guest administrator who is granted access to the graphical console
of a Xen guest can access the qemu monitor.  The monitor can be used
to access host resources.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can access host resources (perhaps
belonging to other guests or the underlying system) and may be able to
escalate their privilege to that of the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Installations where guest administrators do not have access to a
domain's graphical console, or containing only PV domains configured
without a graphical console, are not vulnerable.

Installations where all guest administrators are trustworthy are not
vulnerable, even if the guest operating systems themselves are
untrusted.

Systems using xend/xm: At least all versions since Xen 4.0 are
affected.  Systems are vulnerable even if "monitor=no" is specified in
the xm domain configuration file - this configuration option is not
properly honoured in the vulnerable versions.

Systems using libxl/xl: All versions are affected.  The "monitor="
option is not understood, and is therefore ignored, by xl.  However,
systems using the experimental device model version based on upstream
qemu are NOT vulnerable; that is, Xen 4.2 RC systems with
device_model_version="qemu_xen" specified in the xl domain config
file.

Systems using libvirt are vulnerable.  For "xen:" URIs, see xend/xm,
above.  For "libxl:" URIs, all versions are affected.

Systems based on the Xen Cloud Platform are NOT vulnerable.

CONFIRMING VULNERABILITY
========================

Connect to the guest's VNC (or SDL) graphical display and make sure
your focus is in that window.  Hold down CTRL and ALT and press 2.
You will see a black screen showing one of "serial0", "parallel0" or
"QEMU <version> monitor".  Repeat this exercise for other digits 3 to
6.  CTRL+ALT+1 is the domain's normal graphical console.  Not all
numbers will have screens attached, but note that you must release and
re-press CTRL and ALT each time.

If one of the accessible screens shows "QEMU <version> monitor" then
you are vulnerable.  Otherwise you are not.

MITIGATION
==========

With xl in Xen 4.1 and later, supplying the following config
option in the VM configuration file will disable the monitor:
   device_model_args=["-monitor","null"]

With xend the following config option will disable the monitor:
   monitor_path="null"
Note that with a vulnerable version of the software specifying
"monitor=0" will NOT disable the monitor.

We are not currently aware of the availability of mitigation for
systems using libvirt.

NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO
======================

This issue was publicly discussed online by its discoverer.
There is therefore no embargo.

NOTE REGARDING CVE
==================

This issue was previously reported in a different context, not to Xen
upstream, and assigned CVE-2007-0998 and fixed in a different way.  We
have requested a new CVE for XSA-19 but it is not yet available.

RESOLUTION
==========

The attached patch against qemu-xen-traditional
(qemu-xen-4.*-testing.git) resolves this issue.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 19 (CVE-2012-4411) - guest administrator
 can access qemu monitor console

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

                 Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-4411 / XSA-19
			      version 2

         guest administrator can access qemu monitor console

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

We have now been issued with a CVE number.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

A guest administrator who is granted access to the graphical console
of a Xen guest can access the qemu monitor.  The monitor can be used
to access host resources.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can access host resources (perhaps
belonging to other guests or the underlying system) and may be able to
escalate their privilege to that of the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Installations where guest administrators do not have access to a
domain's graphical console, or containing only PV domains configured
without a graphical console, are not vulnerable.

Installations where all guest administrators are trustworthy are not
vulnerable, even if the guest operating systems themselves are
untrusted.

Systems using xend/xm: At least all versions since Xen 4.0 are
affected.  Systems are vulnerable even if "monitor=no" is specified in
the xm domain configuration file - this configuration option is not
properly honoured in the vulnerable versions.

Systems using libxl/xl: All versions are affected.  The "monitor="
option is not understood, and is therefore ignored, by xl.  However,
systems using the experimental device model version based on upstream
qemu are NOT vulnerable; that is, Xen 4.2 RC systems with
device_model_version="qemu_xen" specified in the xl domain config
file.

Systems using libvirt are vulnerable.  For "xen:" URIs, see xend/xm,
above.  For "libxl:" URIs, all versions are affected.

Systems based on the Xen Cloud Platform are NOT vulnerable.

CONFIRMING VULNERABILITY
========================

Connect to the guest's VNC (or SDL) graphical display and make sure
your focus is in that window.  Hold down CTRL and ALT and press 2.
You will see a black screen showing one of "serial0", "parallel0" or
"QEMU <version> monitor".  Repeat this exercise for other digits 3 to
6.  CTRL+ALT+1 is the domain's normal graphical console.  Not all
numbers will have screens attached, but note that you must release and
re-press CTRL and ALT each time.

If one of the accessible screens shows "QEMU <version> monitor" then
you are vulnerable.  Otherwise you are not.

MITIGATION
==========

With xl in Xen 4.1 and later, supplying the following config
option in the VM configuration file will disable the monitor:
   device_model_args=["-monitor","null"]

With xend the following config option will disable the monitor:
   monitor_path="null"
Note that with a vulnerable version of the software specifying
"monitor=0" will NOT disable the monitor.

We are not currently aware of the availability of mitigation for
systems using libvirt.

NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO
======================

This issue was publicly discussed online by its discoverer.
There is therefore no embargo.

RESOLUTION
==========

The attached patch against qemu-xen-traditional
(qemu-xen-4.*-testing.git) resolves this issue.
