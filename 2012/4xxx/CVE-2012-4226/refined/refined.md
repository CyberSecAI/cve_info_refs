- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "Quick Post Widget" version 1.9.1 is vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present in the Quick Post Widget plugin. These vulnerabilities can be triggered via the 'Title', 'Content' and 'New category' fields when posting a quick post.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. This code will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors are GET and POST requests to the WordPress installation, targeting the 'Quick Post Widget' plugin. The malicious scripts are injected via the 'Title', 'Content', and 'New category' fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the WordPress website where the vulnerable plugin is installed. This can likely be done by a user with permissions to post, or via direct crafted requests if the relevant form is available to unauthenticated users.
