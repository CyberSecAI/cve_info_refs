Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the 389 Directory Server handles LDAP modifyRDN operations, specifically when moving a DN entry to a new superior location. The server failed to properly evaluate Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the moved entry until the next server restart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **ACL Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass ACL definitions. When a user had access to a set of DN entries, but was denied access to a subset of those entries, moving a DN entry via `modifyRDN` could temporarily grant access to the restricted subset. This is because the server wasn't properly enforcing ACLs against the moved object's new location.
*   **Incorrect Parameter Passing to ACL plugin:** The ACL plugin was not receiving the `SLAPI_MODRDN_NEWSUPERIOR` parameter during the modrdn operation, which resulted in the plugin not being able to evaluate ACLs correctly after the move.
*   **ACL cache not updated:**  The ACL cache was not properly updated after the modrdn operation, leading to the server's continued use of old ACL information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information that should have been protected by ACLs, potentially compromising confidentiality. The access is temporary until the next directory server restart.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to bypass ACLs could potentially be used as a step in a larger exploit chain leading to privilege escalation or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LDAP `modifyRDN` operation:** An attacker with the ability to execute `modifyRDN` operations, even with limited privileges on other aspects of the directory, can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated LDAP User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated LDAP user.
*   **`modifyRDN` Privileges:** The attacker must have the ability to perform LDAP modify relative distinguished name (`modifyRDN`) operations on the target entries.
*   **Knowledge of Directory Structure:**  The attacker needs to understand enough about the directory structure and ACL configurations to move entries into locations where they would obtain unintended access.
*   **Exploitation Timing:** The attacker must move entries and access resources before the next server restart, at which point the ACL would be enforced again.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was discovered by Noriko Hosoi of Red Hat.
*   The fix involves passing the `SLAPI_MODRDN_NEWSUPERIOR` parameter to the ACL plugin and updating the ACL cache after `modrdn` operations.
*   The vulnerability affects the 389 Directory Server and has been addressed in updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
