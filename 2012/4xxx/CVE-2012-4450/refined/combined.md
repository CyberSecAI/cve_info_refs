How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=896256#c0)  Nathan Kinder    2013-01-16 22:25:47 UTC  ``` This bug is created as a clone of upstream ticket: <https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/556>  I had a custom certmap.conf as part of a pki-core install and after upgrading it was reverted to a standard certmap.conf.  389-ds-base-1.3.0.0-1.fc18.x86_64  This particular system had done some previous testing of these bits. When F-18 came out I wanted to sync it to reality so I did a: yum distro-sync  This downgraded to 389-ds-base-1.3.0-0.1.a1  Then I updated back to 1.3.0.0-1   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=896256#c7)  Sankar Ramalingam    2013-02-05 10:50:45 UTC  ``` Added a comment to "/etc/dirsrv/slapd-kvm-guest-02/certmap.conf" file and upgraded the instance from RHEL6.3 to RHEL6.4. The file's content is not updated after upgrade. Hence marking the bug as Verified.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=896256#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 08:22:00 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0503.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE Request -- 389-ds-base: Change on SLAPI_MODRDN_NEWSUPERIOR is
 not evaluated in ACL (ACL rules bypass possible)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Noriko Hosoi of Red Hat notified us about the following deficiency:

A possibility to bypass access control list (ACL) definitions was found
in the way 389 Directory Server performed LDAP modifyRDN operation upon
request from client. When a user has been granted access to set of DN
entries, but denied access to a specific subset of those entries, it
was possible the user to obtain temporary (till next Directory Server
restart) access to that subset of entries (they should not have had
otherwise ability to access) when the DN entry was moved via database
modify RDN function.

Upstream ticket:
[1] <https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/340>

Relevant upstream patch:
[2] <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/389/ds.git/commit/?id=5beb93d42efb807838c09c5fab898876876f8d09>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=860603#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-26 09:32:20 UTC  ``` A possibility to bypass access control list (ACL) definitions was found in the way 389 Directory Server performed LDAP modifyRDN operation upon request from client. When a user has been granted access to set of DN entries, but denied access to a specific subset of those entries, it was possible the user to obtain temporary (till next Directory Server restart) access to that subset of entries (they should not have had otherwise ability to access) when the DN entry was moved via database modify RDN function.

#### #340 Change on SLAPI\_MODRDN\_NEWSUPERIOR is not evaluated in acl Closed: wontfix None Opened 12 years ago by nhosoi.

Closed: wontfix
Reopen Issue

plugin\_acl.c

/ *This function is now fully executed for internal and replicated ops.* /

int

plugin\_call\_acl\_mods\_update ( Slapi\_PBlock \*pb, int optype )

case SLAPI\_OPERATION\_MODRDN:

/ *newrdn: "change" is normalized but not case-ignored* /

/ *The acl plugin expects normalized newrdn, but no need to be case-

- ignored.* /

(void)slapi\_pblock\_get( pb, SLAPI\_MODRDN\_NEWRDN, &change );

break;

Bug description:

The change on SLAPI\_MODRDN\_NEWSUPERIOR is not evaluated in acl.

There may be other places in the code where there is an implicit assumption that modrdn with new superior is not supported.

Bug Description: When modrdn operation was executed, only newrdn

change was passed to the acl plugin. Also, the change was used

only for the acl search, but not for the acl target in the items

in the acl cache.

Fix Description: This patch also passes the newsuperior update

to the acl plugin. And the modrdn updates are applied to the

acl target in the acl cache.

looks good

just get rid of the dead code instead of the #ifdef 0

you can avoid having to calloc mychange by just declaring it on the stack:

void \*mychange[2];

or something like that.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0503)

## Topic

Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue, numerous bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The 389-ds-base packages provide 389 Directory Server, which is an LDAPv3
compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server
administration.

A flaw was found in the way 389 Directory Server enforced ACLs after
performing an LDAP modify relative distinguished name (modrdn) operation.
After modrdn was used to move part of a tree, the ACLs defined on the moved
(Distinguished Name) were not properly enforced until the server was
restarted. This could allow LDAP users to access information that should be
restricted by the defined ACLs. (CVE-2012-4450)

This issue was discovered by Noriko Hosoi of Red Hat.

These updated 389-ds-base packages include numerous bug fixes and
enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4
Technical Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most
significant of these changes.

All users of 389-ds-base are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct this issue and provide numerous bug fixes and enhancements.
After installing this update, the 389 server service will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Also, the change was used only for the acl search, but not for the acl target in the items in the acl cache. Consequence: Once modrdn is operated, acl assigned to the entry was temporarily disabled until the server is restarted. Fix: The newsuperior update is also passed to the acl plugin. And the modrdn updates are applied to the acl target in the acl cache. Result: Acl is not affected by the modrdn operation. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2013-02-21 08:20:58 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Also, the change was used only for the acl search, but not for the acl target in the items in the acl cache. Consequence: Once modrdn is operated, acl assigned to the entry was temporarily disabled until the server is restarted. Fix: The newsuperior update is also passed to the acl plugin. And the modrdn updates are applied to the acl target in the acl cache. Result: Acl is not affected by the modrdn operation. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2013-02-21 08:20:58 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |
