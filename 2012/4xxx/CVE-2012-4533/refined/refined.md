Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that ViewVC does not properly HTML-escape the "function name" lines returned by the diff command. These lines are located in the diff output starting with "@@". This lack of escaping allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability is present in how the diff view of ViewVC handles function name lines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
  - Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves:
 1. An attacker with commit access to a repository inserts malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into a file's content, specifically within the line that will be used as a "function name" line in a diff.
 2. The attacker commits this file.
 3.  The attacker then changes the line used in the previous step and commits again, generating a diff.
 4. When a user views the diff in ViewVC, the injected script is executed in their browser because the output is not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs commit access to the repository being viewed with ViewVC.
- The attacker must be able to create and commit changes to files in the repository.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in ViewVC versions 1.0.x before 1.0.13 and 1.1.x before 1.1.16.
- The issue is present if the "hr_funout" setting, which displays function names in diffs, is enabled. While this may not be the default in all versions of viewvc, versions 1.1.5 and later seem to enable it by default.
- The fix involves ensuring that the "function name" lines in the diff view are properly HTML-escaped to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
