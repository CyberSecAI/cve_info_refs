Subject: viewvc: XSS bug in diff view
Date: Sat, 20 Oct 2012 17:54:18 -0300
[Message part 1 (text/plain, inline)]
Package: viewvc
Version: 1.1.5-1.3
Severity: important
Tags: security

There is an XSS bug in the diff view, exploitable by people with commit
access to the repository. The "function name" lines returned by diff (in
the diff lines starting with @@) are not HTML-escaped.

Here's an example. Add this file to a SVN repository:

blah
x <script>alert("XSS!");</script>
one context
two context
three context
trigger

Commit it. Next, change the line labeled 'trigger', and commit again.
The diff produced by the second commit is:

@@ -3,4 +3,4 @@ x <script>alert("XSS!");</script>
 one context
 two context
 three context
- -trigger
+trigger X

When telling ViewVC to show the diff of that file for the last commit,
it doesn't HTML-escape the <script>, so it gets executed.

I'm attaching a patch that should fix this bug.

I don't have a CVE number. I haven't reported this upstream. I quickly
glanced at the upstream bug list and dev list archives and it didn't
seem to be already reported, but I didn't search carefully.

I checked CVE (nothing for this) and the ChangeLogs/etc. This is
indeed a new issue. Please use CVE-2012-4533 for this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: viewvc: XSS bug in diff view
Date: Sat, 20 Oct 2012 17:54:18 -0300
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=691062;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: viewvc
Version: 1.1.5-1.3
Severity: important
Tags: security

There is an XSS bug in the diff view, exploitable by people with commit
access to the repository. The "function name" lines returned by diff (in
the diff lines starting with @@) are not HTML-escaped.

Here's an example. Add this file to a SVN repository:

blah
x <script>alert("XSS!");</script>
one context
two context
three context
trigger

Commit it. Next, change the line labeled 'trigger', and commit again.
The diff produced by the second commit is:

@@ -3,4 +3,4 @@ x <script>alert("XSS!");</script>
 one context
 two context
 three context
-trigger
+trigger X

When telling ViewVC to show the diff of that file for the last commit,
it doesn't HTML-escape the <script>, so it gets executed.

I'm attaching a patch that should fix this bug.

I don't have a CVE number. I haven't reported this upstream. I quickly
glanced at the upstream bug list and dev list archives and it didn't
seem to be already reported, but I didn't search carefully.

found 691062 0.9.4+svn20060318-1
thanks

I tested every version in snapshot.debian.org and they are all
affected, if the hr_funout setting (show function names in diffs) is
enabled. Although only 1.1.5+ seem to have it enabled by default.

Package        : viewvc
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-5024 CVE-2012-3356 CVE-2012-3357 CVE-2012-4533

Several vulnerabilities were found in ViewVC, a web interface for CVS
and Subversion repositories.

CVE-2009-5024: remote attackers can bypass the cvsdb row_limit
configuration setting, and consequently conduct resource-consumption
attacks via the limit parameter.

CVE-2012-3356: the remote SVN views functionality does not properly
perform authorization, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions.

CVE-2012-3357: the SVN revision view does not properly handle log
messages when a readable path is copied from an unreadable path, which
allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2012-4533: "function name" lines returned by diff are not properly
escaped, allowing attackers with commit access to perform cross site
scripting.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.5-1.1+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.5-1.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your viewvc packages.
