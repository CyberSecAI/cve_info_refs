Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Bitcoin protocol's alert system, designed to disseminate important news, was vulnerable to a CPU exhaustion attack. The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that the signature verification process for alerts was computationally expensive (taking 1-4 milliseconds) and was performed *before* checking if the alert had already been processed. An attacker could therefore flood a node with invalid alerts, forcing it to repeatedly perform the costly signature checks and leading to CPU exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inefficient Alert Verification:** The system did not check for duplicate alerts before verifying their signatures.
*   **Lack of DoS Protection:** The code did not treat signature verification failures as a potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack vector.
*   **High CPU Cost of Signature Verification:** The signature verification process was computationally intensive, making it a suitable target for CPU exhaustion attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exhaust the CPU resources of a Bitcoin node by flooding it with invalid alerts.
*   **System Slowdown:** Even though the affected thread had a below-normal priority, the high CPU usage would still result in noticeable system slowdown, impacting the node's ability to process transactions and maintain network connectivity.
*   **Network Partitioning:** By targeting key nodes within the Bitcoin network, an attacker could potentially partition the network, enabling double-spending.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Connection:** An attacker with a direct connection to a victim node could send a flood of invalid alerts.
*   **Network Relay:** An attacker could target a set of nodes that, if taken offline, could split the network, thereby facilitating double-spending attacks in the isolated network segments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the targeted node(s).
*   **Low Bandwidth:** The attack can be effective even with a low-bandwidth connection (as low as 3KB/s), requiring minimal resources on the attacker's end.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require special privileges or access to the victim's node, making it easy to perform.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was present in Bitcoin client versions prior to 0.7.0.
* The attack involves sending alerts with invalid signatures. The signature verification time does not depend on the correctness of the signature.
* The vulnerability can be exploited even if the attacker sends previously received correct alerts, as CheckSignature() is called before checking the mapAlerts.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.7.0 of the Bitcoin client by:
    1. Disconnecting from any node that sends a bad alert (return DoS(...))
    2. Checking that an alert is not verified more than once by checking the existence of the alert in mapAlerts before doing a CheckSignature()
* It was discovered by Sergio Demian Lerner from Certimix.com.
