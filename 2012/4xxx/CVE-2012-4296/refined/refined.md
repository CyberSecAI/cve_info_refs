```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the RTPS2 dissector.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow in the RTPS2 dissector
- Impact of exploitation:  It may be possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service. In some cases, it could also potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to inject a specially crafted packet into the network or convince a user to open a malicious capture file.
