Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Midnight Commander (mc) handles the `MC_EXT_SELECTED` and `MC_EXT_ONLYTAGGED` environment variables when multiple files are selected. When a user presses F3 or Enter on a selected file that triggers an `mc.ext` rule, `mc` creates a temporary shell script. This script sets environment variables with the names of the selected files. The issue is that these file lists are space-separated and are not properly quoted when assigned to these environment variables within the temporary script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization/quoting of filenames containing spaces when they are assigned to the environment variables in the temporary shell script.
*   **Unquoted Environment Variables:** The environment variables `MC_EXT_SELECTED` and `MC_EXT_ONLYTAGGED`, which store lists of selected files, are not quoted, leading to command injection if an attacker can control the filenames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could craft a malicious archive containing files with carefully chosen names (e.g., names that are valid commands or paths to executables). If a victim extracts this archive and then views the files in Midnight Commander, selecting multiple files and hitting F3 or Enter would cause the shell to interpret the file names as commands, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running `mc`.
*   **Privilege Escalation (potential):** If the user running `mc` has elevated privileges, this could lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Archive:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted archive containing malicious filenames.
*   **User Interaction:**  The victim needs to expand the crafted archive and then view the files within `mc`, select multiple files, and press F3 or Enter to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create an archive with specifically crafted filenames.
*   **Social Engineering (or similar):** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the archive and viewing the files in `mc` to execute the malicious filenames as commands.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of `mc` prior to 4.8.7.
*   The issue was reported by Paul Hartman and further investigated by Jan Lieskovsky
*   The fix involves properly quoting the filenames when assigning them to the vulnerable environment variables. A patch has been provided which addresses this.
* The vulnerability can be triggered with multiple files but the first file is assigned to the MC_EXT_SELECTED variable while the remaining are interpreted as arguments
