Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the `WebView` class within multiple GREE Android applications. These applications use an SDK for HTML-based applications provided by GREE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The core issue is a vulnerability in the handling of `WebView` within the GREE Android applications. This allows potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript content to be loaded within the context of the application, which may lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact is the potential disclosure of information managed by the affected applications.
- This occurs when a user of a vulnerable application also uses a malicious Android application.
- The malicious application can exploit the `WebView` vulnerability to access sensitive data belonging to the vulnerable GREE application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves a malicious Android application.
- This malicious app would need to be installed on the same device as a vulnerable GREE application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious Android application.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to install the malicious application.
- The attacker doesn't need any special access or authentication to the vulnerable application, other than the user having the application installed.
- The attacker can be remote, as long as they can distribute a malicious application to the target user.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is considered "High" severity regarding access required and no authentication and "Mid-High" in exploit complexity.
- User interaction is required to install the malicious application.
- The affected applications are only available in Japanese.
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Takeshi Terada of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc., and Katsuhiko Sato of Japan Smartphone Security Association(JSSEC).
