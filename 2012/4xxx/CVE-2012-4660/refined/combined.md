Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software will vary   depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions   and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about   the affected versions.      Cisco PIX Security Appliances may be affected by some of the   vulnerabilities described in this security advisory. Cisco PIX has   reached end of software maintenance. Cisco PIX Security Appliance   customers are encouraged to migrate to Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive   Security Appliances. Consult the dedicated section for Cisco PIX   Security Appliances in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this   security advisory for more information about affected versions.   Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory.      **DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability**      This vulnerability is triggered when the Cisco ASA Software processes a DHCP request. DHCP relay and DHCP server features will trigger the DHCP request packet process. If either feature is enabled, the Cisco ASA Software may be vulnerable.    To determine whether the DHCP server feature is enabled on Cisco ASA Software use the   **show dhcpd state** command and verify that at least one interface is configured   for DHCP server. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with DHCP   server enabled on the *inside* interface  ```   ciscoasa# show dhcpd state   Context  Configured as DHCP Server   Interface inside, Configured for DHCP SERVER      ```  To determine whether the DHCP relay feature is enabled on Cisco ASA Software use the   **show dhcprelay state** command and verify that DHCP relay is active. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with DHCP relay enabled.  ```   ciscoasa# show dhcprelay stateContext  Configured as DHCP RelayInterface outside, Configured for DHCP RELAY SERVERInterface inside, Configured for DHCP RELAY   ```  **Note:** By default, DHCP server is enabled on the inside interface of the Cisco ASA 5505 and on the management interface of all other Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. DHCP server is disabled by default on Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module.  DHCP relay feature is not enabled by default on any Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco   Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module platforms.          **SSL VPN Authentication Denial of Service Vulnerability** This vulnerability may affect Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN. Cisco ASA Software configured as an IPsec VPN Server, IPsec/L2TP VPN Server or IKEv2 AnyConnect VPN server is not affected. Because this vulnerability is triggered when receiving a crafted authentication challenge-response, Cisco ASA Software is not affected when configured to use the AAA protocol that does not support the challenge option or with the challenge option disabled.  To be affected, the Cisco ASA Software should have SSL VPN enabled and the   tunnel group configured to authenticate to a remote AAA server using a   AAA protocol that has the AAA challenge option enabled.       Currently the following AAA setup may be configured with the challenge option enabled and hence be considered vulnerable:    1. Native RSA SecurID (also known as SDI) - This is vulnerable when the SecureID server requires a challenge response from the user.   2. RADIUS and TACACS+ authentication challenge - These are vulnerable when the AAA server uses a token-based authentication system which is capable of sending challenge requests to authenticating users.   3. Active Directory password management via RADIUS or LDAP. In these cases the Cisco ASA Software facilitates a user password change prior to authentication with Active Directory.Other AAA authentication methods supported by the Cisco ASA Software such as HTTP form-based or using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and Kerberos authentication protocols   are not affected by this vulnerability.    To determine whether Cisco ASA Software has SSL VPN enabled use the **show   running-config webvpn** command and verify that SSL VPN is enabled on at least one   interface. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SSL VPN enabled   on the *outside* interface:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn   webvpn    enable outside      ```  To determine whether the Cisco ASA Software has the tunnel group configured for   a remote AAA server, use the **show running-config tunnel-group    general-attributes** command and verify that the   *authentication-server-group* is set to authenticate to a remote AAA   server. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with the tunnel group   *WebVPN* configured to authenticate against a remote AAA server with tag labeled *RSA*.  ```   ciscoasa#show running-config tunnel-group WebVPN general-attributes   tunnel-group WebVPN general-attributes    authentication-server-group RSA   ```  To determine which AAA protocol is in use for a given AAA server, use the **show aaa-server** . The AAA protocol in use is indicated under *Server Group*. The following example shows a AAA server with tag labeled *RSA* which is using RSA SecurID (SDI) as AAA protocol:  ```   ciscoasa# show aaa-server RSAServer Group:    RSAServer Protocol: sdi   ```  **Note:** SSL VPN is not enabled by default. The default AAA setting for tunnel   group is LOCAL which is not affected by this vulnerability.       **SIP Inspection Media Update Denial of Service Vulnerability**      The Cisco ASA Software may be affected by this vulnerability if Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) inspection is enabled.      To determine whether SIP inspection is enabled use the   **show service-policy inspect sip** command. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software   with SIP inspection enabled:     ```    ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sip      Inspect: sip , packet 67, drop 0, reset-drop 0    ```  **Note:** SIP inspection functionality is enabled by default.    **DCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability and DCERPC Inspection Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by these vulnerabilities if DCERPC inspection is enabled.      To determine whether the DCERPC inspection is enabled use the   **show service-policy | include dcerpc** command. The following example shows the Cisco ASA   Software with DCERPC inspection enabled:     ```    ciscoasa# show  service-policy | include dcerpc      Inspect: dcerpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0    ```  **Note:** DCERPC inspection is not enabled by default.    Determine the Running Software Version To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version**   command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive   Security Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):      ```    ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) Device Manager Version 6.4(1)    ```    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to   manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is   displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM   window. Information about Cisco PIX Security Appliance SoftwareAll versions of the Cisco PIX Security Appliance Software are affected by the DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability.      Cisco PIX Security Appliance Software is not affected by any other vulnerabilities described in this security advisory.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall and Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security are not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      With the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The following section provides additional information about each vulnerability.   **DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability**    DHCP is a   protocol that supplies automatic configuration parameters such as an IP   address with a subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server, and WINS server   IP address to hosts.  The   Cisco ASA Software can act as a DHCP server or a DHCP client. When it operates   as a server, the Cisco ASA Software provides network configuration parameters   directly to DHCP clients.  A   vulnerability exists in the implementation of the Dynamic Host   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server functionality that   would allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of   the affected device. This vulnerability is due to a failure in   allocating memory for an internal DHCP data structure upon receiving   crafted DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a sequence of crafted DHCP packets to the affected system  **Note:** This vulnerability may be triggered by both transit traffic and traffic directed to the affected device. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall modes in both single-context and multicontext modes. This vulnerability can be triggered only by   IPv4 traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtw84068](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtw84068) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4643   **SSL VPN Authentication Denial of Service Vulnerability**      The Cisco ASA Software includes two types of SSL VPN, which is a technology for remote access to corporate resources:   + Clientless SSL VPN provides access to Web applications, such as email, and     corporate portals via Web browsers and Java components. It requires no     client software.   + The AnyConnect SSL VPN Client.   A vulnerability exists in the implementation of the   authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) code for remote   the SSL VPN (Clientless and AnyConnect) feature that could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected   system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of a crafted   authentication response when a AAA challenge-response is required to complete the   authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   trying to authenticate on an ASA configured for SSL VPN with a   crafted authentication challenge response. This   vulnerability affects a Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN. Cisco ASA Software configured as an IPsec VPN Server, IPSEC/L2TP VPN Server or IKEv2 AnyConnect server is not affected. **Note:**   Only traffic destined to the affected device can be used to exploit   this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software configured in   routed and single context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 traffic only.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtz04566](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz04566) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4659      **SIP Inspection Media Update Denial of Service Vulnerability**    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as defined by the   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), enables call handling sessions,   particularly two-party audio conferences. SIP works with Session Description Protocol (SDP)   for call signaling. SDP specifies the ports for the media stream.   Cisco ASA Software supports dynamic allocation of ports for media stream via a dedicated SIP inspection engine.  A vulnerability exists in the SIP inspection engine code of the Cisco ASA Software, that   may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of   the affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper processing   of SIP media update packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP packet through the affected system. The   packets that trigger this vulnerability must be part of an established   SIP inspection session that needs to be inspected by the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This   vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both   single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtr63728](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr63728) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4660   **DCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**      DCERPC is a protocol that is widely used by Microsoft distributed client and server applications that allows software   clients to remotely execute programs on a server.      A vulnerability exists in the DCERPC inspection engine that would allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to overflow the stack and possibly execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DCERPC packets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a crafted DCERPC packet that needs to be inspected by the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit   this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and   transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This   vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtr21359](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr21359) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4661      **DCERPC Inspection Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities**      Two vulnerabilities exist in the DCERPC inspection engine that would allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of DCERPC packets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a crafted DCERPC packet that needs to be inspected by the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit   these vulnerabilities. This vulnerabilities affects both routed and   transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs, [CSCtr21376](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr21376) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCtr21346](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr21346) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2012-4662 and CVE-2012-4663  Workarounds  * The following section contains information about a workaround, if available, for each vulnerability described in this security advisory.  **DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability**Besides disabling the DHCP server and DHCP relay features, there are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. **SSL VPN Authentication Denial of Service Vulnerability**There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. **SIP Inspection Media Update Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Disabling SIP inspection will mitigate this vulnerability.      The following commands will disable the SIP inspection that is configured by default:  ```      ```   ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy   ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default   ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sip   ```      ```  **DCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability and DCERPC Inspection Denial Of   Service Vulnerabilities**  Besides disabling the DCERPC inspection, there are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  **Access Vector**  ---   Local (L) A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo). Adjacent Network (A) A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and local Ethernet segment.  Network (N) A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". An example of a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  **Access Complexity**  ---   High (H)  Specialized access conditions exist. For example: In most configurations, the attacking party must already have elevated privileges or spoof additional systems in addition to the attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking). The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be easily detected by knowledgeable people. For example, the victim must perform several suspicious or atypical actions. The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice. If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow. Medium (M)  The access conditions are somewhat specialized; the following are examples: The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at some level of authorization, possibly untrusted. Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be launched. The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly configured (e.g., a vulnerability present when a server performs user account authentication via a specific scheme, but not present for another authentication scheme). The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might occasionally fool cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify a web browser?s status bar to show a false link, having to be on someone?s ?buddy? list before sending an IM exploit).  Low (L)  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are examples: The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server). The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous. The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional information gathering. The ?race condition? is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  **Authentication**  ---   Multiple (M) Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials are used each time. An example is an attacker authenticating to an operating system in addition to providing credentials to access an application hosted on that system. Single (S) The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface).  None (N) Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  **Confidentiality Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. Partial (P) There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain tables in a database.  Complete (C) There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all of the system's data (memory, files, etc.)  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  **Integrity Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the integrity of the system. Partial (P) Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. For example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified, but either the attacker has no control over which files are affected or the attacker can modify files within only a limited context or scope.  Complete (C) There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on the target system.  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete  **Availability Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the availability of the system. Partial (P)There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. An example is a network-based flood attack that permits a limited number of successful connections to an Internet service.  Complete (C) There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.    Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   **Collateral Damage Potential**  ---   None (N) There is no potential for loss of life, physical assets, productivity or revenue. Low (L) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in slight physical or property damage. Or, there may be a slight loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Low-Medium (LM) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in moderate physical or property damage. Or, there may be a moderate loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Medium-High (MH) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in significant physical or property damage or loss. Or, there may be a significant loss of revenue or productivity.  High (H) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in catastrophic physical or property damage and loss. Or, there may be a catastrophic loss of revenue or productivity.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   **Target Distribution**  ---   None (N) No target systems exist, or targets are so highly specialized that they only exist in a laboratory setting. Effectively 0% of the environment is at risk. Low (L) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a small scale. Between 1% - 25% of the total environment is at risk.  Medium (M) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a medium scale. Between 26% - 75% of the total environment is at risk.  High (H) Targets exist inside the environment on a considerable scale. Between 76% - 100% of the total environment is considered at risk.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   **Confidentiality Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   **Integrity Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of integrity is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of integrity is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of integrity is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High   **Availability Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of availability is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of availability is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of availability is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.    Environmental Score: |
