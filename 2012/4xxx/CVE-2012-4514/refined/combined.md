This attempt was from a different computer the one I used in my original report.  Like the other one, this PC is running openSUSE 11.4.  Additional info:  Attempting this login to the same hardware from openSUSE 11.3 running on the same dual-booting PC as the one generating the original report was successful.  The crash appears to happen between the time the <Enter> key is pressed and Konqueror asks if I want it to save the login credentials.  The crashing PCs never reach that question from Konqueror.  -- Backtrace (Reduced): #7  0xaf86b664 in operator KHTMLPart* (this=0x0) at /usr/include/QtCore/qpointer.h:78 #8  KHTMLPart::opener (this=0x0) at /usr/src/debug/kdelibs-4.6.0/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:6921 #9  0xaf86b6fa in KHTMLPartPrivate::canNavigate (this=0x8560c00, bCand=0x0) at /usr/src/debug/kdelibs-4.6.0/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:5241 #10 0xaf8865ac in KHTMLPartPrivate::findFrameParent (this=0x8560c00, callingPart=0x8402bd8, f=..., childFrame=0x0, checkForNavigation=true) at /usr/src/debug/kdelibs-4.6.0/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:5196 #11 0xaf8b5361 in KHTMLPartBrowserHostExtension::findFrameParent (this=0x85681f0, callingPart=0x8402bd8, frame=...) at /usr/src/debug/kdelibs-4.6.0/khtml/khtml_ext.cpp:995 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=271528#c2)  Andrei Slavoiu    2011-11-17 19:35:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 65791](attachment.cgi?id=65791 "New crash information added by DrKonqi") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=65791&action=edit "New crash information added by DrKonqi") New crash information added by DrKonqi  konqueror (4.7.3 (4.7.3)) on KDE Platform 4.7.3 (4.7.3) using Qt 4.7.4  I was finalizing an online payment using secure.epayment.ro  -- Backtrace (Reduced): #6  operator KHTMLPart* (this=) at /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qpointer.h:78 #7  KHTMLPart::opener (this=0x0) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:6922 #8  0x0000003202606bda in KHTMLPartPrivate::canNavigate (this=0x21b7430, bCand=<optimized out>) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:5242 #9  0x000000320261a898 in KHTMLPartPrivate::findFrameParent (this=0x21b7430, callingPart=0x2151030, f=..., childFrame=0x0, checkForNavigation=true) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:5197 #10 0x000000320264a239 in KHTMLPartBrowserHostExtension::findFrameParent (this=<optimized out>, callingPart=<optimized out>, frame=<optimized out>) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_ext.cpp:995 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=271528#c3)  Andrei Slavoiu    2011-11-17 19:35:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 65792](attachment.cgi?id=65792 "New crash information added by DrKonqi") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=65792&action=edit "New crash information added by DrKonqi") New crash information added by DrKonqi  konqueror (4.7.3 (4.7.3)) on KDE Platform 4.7.3 (4.7.3) using Qt 4.7.4  I was finalizing an online payment using secure.epayment.ro  -- Backtrace (Reduced): #6  operator KHTMLPart* (this=) at /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qpointer.h:78 #7  KHTMLPart::opener (this=0x0) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:6922 #8  0x0000003202606bda in KHTMLPartPrivate::canNavigate (this=0x21b7430, bCand=<optimized out>) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:5242 #9  0x000000320261a898 in KHTMLPartPrivate::findFrameParent (this=0x21b7430, callingPart=0x2151030, f=..., childFrame=0x0, checkForNavigation=true) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_part.cpp:5197 #10 0x000000320264a239 in KHTMLPartBrowserHostExtension::findFrameParent (this=<optimized out>, callingPart=<optimized out>, frame=<optimized out>) at /var/tmp/portage/kde-base/kdelibs-4.7.3/work/kdelibs-4.7.3/khtml/khtml_ext.cpp:995 ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=271528#c4)  Dawit Alemayehu    2011-11-21 19:33:35 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 280912](show_bug.cgi?id=280912 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE -

Subject: Medium risk security flaws in Konqueror

I recnetly discovered a number of memory corruption flaws in the Konqueror web
browser as used by KDE.

After discussions with the vendor, the following CVEs were assigned to these
vulnerabilities:

1) CVE-2012-4512
2) CVE-2012-4513
3) CVE-2012-4514
4) CVE-2012-4515

The attached advisory gives further details.

Cheers,
Tim

Please note I accidentally put the CVE #'s one spot to low, they
should have been:

Please use CVE-2012-4514 for this issue.

Please use CVE-2012-4515 for this issue.
