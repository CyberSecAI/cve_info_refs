Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Rivettracker application. Specifically, the `$_GET['hash']` parameter in `dltorrent.php` and the `$_POST['hash']` parameter in `torrent_functions.php` are used directly in SQL queries without adequate escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `hash` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability in `torrent_functions.php` exists because access control checks (`$hiddentracker`) are not properly enforced in this file, allowing unauthenticated users to access it. The dltorrent.php can also be accessed if $hiddentracker is false.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords (particularly from config.php), and other confidential data.
*   **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's privileges, an attacker could potentially create database users, execute operating system commands, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  With sufficient database privileges, an attacker could gain shell access and achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The `dltorrent.php` vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `hash` parameter in the URL. An example provided is: `path_to_rivettracker/dltorrent.php?hash=00000' UNION ALL SELECT '../config.php\0`
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The `torrent_functions.php` vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request by manipulating the `hash` parameter in the request body. The provided test form demonstrates this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Rivettracker application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (`hash`) and the path to the vulnerable scripts (`dltorrent.php` and `torrent_functions.php`).
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Access to the vulnerable scripts is available to unauthenticated users if `$hiddentracker` is false, simplifying the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit author notes that a patch for poison null bytes (PNB) on PHP versions 5.3.4 and later prevents the retrieval of config.php using a null byte. However, arbitrary SQL queries are still possible, allowing other forms of attack.
*   The provided exploit mentions that with sufficient database user privileges, it may be possible to achieve shell access and arbitrary code execution.
*   The exploit-db page also lists this vulnerability as CVE-2012-4996 as well.
