| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products   All versions of Cisco ASA-CX Content-Aware Security and Cisco PRSM software prior to 9.0.2-103 are affected by the vulnerability in this advisory.         **Determining Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security and Cisco Prime Security Manager Software Versions**      To determine the running version of Cisco ASA-CX software, issue the **show version** command from the Cisco ASA-CX command line interface, to which an administrator can get access via serial console, SSH session to the ASA-CX management interface, or a session opened from the parent ASA using the **session** command.         The following example shows Cisco ASA-CX software Version 9.0.1(40) and Cisco PRSM Version 9.0.1(40):   ```   	asacx> show version   	Cisco ASA CX Platform  9.0.1 (40)   	Cisco Prime Security Manager 9.0.1 (40)         ```   Customers using Cisco PRSM to manage Cisco ASA-CX devices can locate the software version of Cisco **ASA-CX in the Device > Devices** part of the Cisco Prime Security Manager window.         To determine the running version of Cisco PRSM software, issue the **show version** command from the Cisco PRSM command line interface, to which an administrator can get access to via PRSM VMware console, or SSH session to the Cisco PRSM management interface.      The following example shows Cisco PRSM software Version 9.0.1(40):   ```   	prsm> show version   	Cisco Prime Security Manager 9.0.1 (40) Multi Device prsm-vm   ```         Customers using HTTPS to access Cisco PRSM can locate the software version of Cisco PRSM in the **Administration > About PRSM** part of the Cisco Prime Security Manager window.      Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA Services Module (ASA-SM) and Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Firewall Services Module (FWSM) are not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Cisco ASA CX Context-Aware Security is an add-on services module that extends the ASA platform with context-aware capabilities for additional visibility and control.   The Cisco Prime Security Manager (PRSM) is the multi-device management platform for Cisco ASA-CX.      The Cisco ASA-CX and Cisco PRSM contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain types of IPv4 packets to the management interface of the Cisco ASA-CX or Cisco PRSM. As a result, the log files grow and consume the /var/log partition. Once the /var/log partition is full, the Cisco ASA-CX module or Cisco PRSM will become unresponsive.      Successful exploitation on a Cisco ASA-CX device could cause the Cisco ASA-CX to become unresponsive and stop processing user traffic.    Successful exploitation on a Cisco PRSM software could cause the Cisco PRSM to become unresponsive.      Only user traffic specifically directed towards the Cisco ASA-CX by the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the parent Cisco ASA is affected by the vulnerability in this advisory.    Management traffic from Cisco PRSM to Cisco ASA-CX is also affected by this vulnerability.         **How to determine if the vulnerability has been exploited**   To determine if the vulnerability has been exploited on the affected device, issue the **show diskusage** command from the command line interface.      The following example shows the output of an affected Cisco ASA-CX or Cisco PRSM where /var/log utilization has reached 100% of use:   ```   	asacx>show diskusage	FILESYSTEM                          SIZE      AVAILABLE           USE%	/                                   3.0G           2.0G            28%	/boot                             407.2M         307.2M            20%	/var                                9.8G           9.2G             2%	/var/data                         498.1G         466.6G             1%	/var/packages                       9.8G           8.7G             7%	/var/config                         1.1G        1004.5M             3%	/var/db                             3.9G           3.6G             4%	/var/log                            3.9G              0           100% 	/var/local                          3.9G           3.6G             4%	/var/data/diagnostics              15.7G          14.8G             1%	/var/data/cores                    15.7G          14.8G             1%         ```      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCub70603](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub70603) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security and Cisco Prime Security Manager and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4629.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.      If the vulnerability has been exploited on the Cisco ASA-CX and the traffic is interrupted, as a mitigation, Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic towards the Cisco ASA-CX can be removed. This will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco ASA-CX module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA.      The following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco ASA-CX from the Cisco ASA firewall:    ```      ```   hostname(config)# class-map http_traffichostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80hostname(config)# policy-map http_traffic_policyhostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffichostname(config-pmap-c)# no cxsc      ```      ```   There are no similar mitigations available for Cisco Prime Security Manager.      Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document for this Advisory: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=26840>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
