- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM InfoSphere Data Replication Dashboard includes a web server that does not properly restrict access to specific directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory listing vulnerability. The web server allows listing of specific directories under the dashboard web application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by listing the files and directories.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable dashboard application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web server.
