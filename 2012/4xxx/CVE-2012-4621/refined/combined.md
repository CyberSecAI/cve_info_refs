| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software DHCP Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20120926-dhcp  First Published: 2012 September 26 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCty96049](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty96049)     CVE-2012-4621     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2012-4621     CWE-399       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120926-dhcp/oval/cisco-sa-20120926-dhcp_205.xml)   Email      Summary  * Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a single DHCP packet to or through an affected device, causing the device to reload.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software versions that include the Device Sensor feature are affected by this vulnerability. Devices that have at least one interface with an IP address are affected.         To determine whether the Cisco IOS Software release includes the Device Sensor feature, issue the **show subsys** command.       The following example shows the Device Sensor feature is included: ```   Switch#show subsys | include dsensor_lite   dsensor_lite                       Protocol    1.000.001   ``` To determine whether an interface is assigned an IP address, issue the **show ip interface brief** command.       The following example indicates the FastEthernet1/0 interface is assigned IP address 10.10.10.1: ```   router#show ip interface brief    Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol   FastEthernet1/0            10.10.10.1      YES manual up                    up         FastEthernet1/1            unassigned      YES NVRAM  up                    up      ```  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>.    Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XE and Cisco IOS XR Software are not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Device Sensor feature of Cisco IOS Software is used to gather raw endpoint data from network devices that are using protocols such as Cisco Discovery Protocol, Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), and DHCP. The endpoint data is available to registered clients in the context of an access session.      Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a single DHCP packet to or through an affected device, causing the device to reload.      The Device Sensor feature, enabled by default, is vulnerable on devices that have at least one interface with an IP address. The vulnerability is triggered when the Device Sensor feature attempts to process a DHCP packet. In affected releases, valid DHCP packets could trigger this vulnerability.       For more information about the Device Sensor feature, please refer to the [Device Sensor Guide](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/15.0_1_se/device_sensor/guide/sensor_guide.html).      This vulnerability was previously documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCty96049](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty96049) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4621.  Workarounds  * In affected releases, the Device Sensor feature is enabled by default. It is possible to mitigate the vulnerability in this advisory by applying the global configuration command **device-sensor filter-spec dhcp exclude all**. This command will filter the Device Sensor feature collection of DHCP packets, and the Device Sensor feature will no longer process or store DHCP information.       In the following example, the global configuration command is issued:    ```   Switch# configure terminal   Switch(config)# device-sensor filter-spec dhcp exclude all      ```    To confirm that the Device Sensor feature is no longer collecting DHCP data, issue the **show device-sensor cache all** command. No DHCP entries should be present in the table.       In the following example, the following table contains only Cisco Discover Protocol data:    ```   Switch# show device-sensor cache all   Device: 000f.f7a7.234f on port GigabitEthernet2/1   --------------------------------------------------   Proto Type:Name Len Value   cdp 22:mgmt-address-type 8 00 16 00 08 00 00 00 00   cdp 19:cos-type 5 00 13 00 05 00   cdp 18:trust-type 5 00 12 00 05 00   cdp 11:duplex-type 5 00 0B 00 05 01   cdp 10:native-vlan-type 6 00 0A 00 06 00 01   cdp 9:vtp-mgmt-domain-type 9 00 09 00 09 63 69 73 63 6F   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2012 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release, where possible.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
