Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when using the "Module Language Switcher" module in Joomla. Specifically, the module doesn't properly handle special characters in the URL, which can be exploited to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected into the application through the URL, and then executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a variety of malicious activities including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Data theft by executing malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious script code. When a user clicks on such a link, the Joomla application fails to properly sanitize the input, and renders the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL targeting a vulnerable Joomla site. They then need to lure the victim into clicking on the crafted link.
- No prior authentication or privileged access is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable module is "Module Language Switcher" in position-4.
- The vulnerability was present in Joomla versions 2.5.6 and earlier 2.5.x versions.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Joomla version 2.5.7.
