  "CVE-2012-4244": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities existed in BIND, the most serious of which may lead to a denial of service. These issues were addressed by updating BIND to version 9.8.5-P1.",
    "root_cause": "A flaw was found in the way BIND handled resource records with a large RDATA value, and a subsequent query for that record would cause named to exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of DNS records with large RDATA values.",
      "Incorrect processing of combinations of resource records."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a recursive resolver, or an authoritative server in certain configurations, to lockup or exit unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted DNS resource records sent from a malicious owner of a DNS domain.",
      "Crafted DNS records in a zone file loaded by a server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create and deploy specially crafted DNS records, or have control over a DNS zone file loaded by the affected system."
