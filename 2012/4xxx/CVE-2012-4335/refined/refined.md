Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** Samsung NET-i ware <= 1.37
*   **Platforms:** Windows
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **A] Endless loop in remote services:**
        *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of negative 32-bit size fields in NET-i ware services.
        *   **Weakness:** This leads to an endless loop.
        *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
        *  **Attack vector:** Remote
        * **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted packet.
    *   **B] Code execution in ConnectDDNS ActiveX:**
        *   **Root cause:** Vulnerability in the ConnectDDNS method of specific ActiveX components.
        *   **Weakness:**  Allows for arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Impact:** Code execution.
         *  **Attack vector:** Remote exploitation of the ActiveX component.
        * **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable method in the ActiveX component.
        *   **Additional notes:** The exploit is considered unreliable to replicate. Specific ActiveX components: EEDBA32E-5C2D-48f1-A58E-0AAB0BC230E3 and 17A7F731-C9EC-461C-B813-2F42A1BB58EB.
    *  **C] Stack overflow in BackupToAvi ActiveX:**
        *   **Root cause:** Stack overflow in the BackupToAvi method.
        *   **Weakness:** Allows for arbitrary code execution due to a buffer overflow.
        *   **Impact:** Code execution.
         *  **Attack vector:** Remote exploitation of the ActiveX component.
        *  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable method in the ActiveX component.
        *   **Additional notes:** Vulnerable ActiveX components: 3D6F2DBA-F4E5-40A6-8725-E99BC96CC23A and 208650B1-3CA1-4406-926D-45F2DBB9C299.

**Exploitation:**

*   The document provides specific commands and links to proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for the vulnerabilities.
    *   For the endless loop in remote services (A), the `udpsz` tool is used with specific parameters to trigger the vulnerability in `NiwMasterService` and `NiwStorageService`.
    *   For the code execution and stack overflow vulnerabilities in ActiveX components (B and C), a PoC zip file (`netiware_1b.zip`) is provided.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document mentions that there is no fix available for these vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities are described by Luigi Auriemma.
*   This document provides more detailed information than the official CVE description, outlining the specific vulnerabilities and providing PoC exploit information.
