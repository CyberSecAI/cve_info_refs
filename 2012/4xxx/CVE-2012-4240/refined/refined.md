  "cve_id": "CVE-2012-4240",
  "description": "Versions of Group-Office (a web app for online collaboration) prior to 4.0.90 are subject to a SQL injection vulnerability located in the calendar module. A PHP file, used to serve data in the JSON format, does not sufficiently sanitise a user-supplied parameter injected into the ORDER BY part of an SQL query. An attacker can leverage this flaw to extract information from the database via SQL errors.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'sort' parameter within the `/modules/calendar/json.php` file when constructing an SQL ORDER BY clause.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes, by injecting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameter. The attacker might be able to take control of the database within the context of the MySQL user, and potentially use this as leverage to further compromise the host machine.",
    "attack_vectors": "By injecting SQL statements into the 'sort' parameter of the `/modules/calendar/json.php` file via an HTTP POST request.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated as a valid user in order for the attack to be successful."

   "affected_products": [
        "Group-Office community 4.0.71",
        "Group-Office community 4.0.73",
        "Group-Office community 4.0.88"
    ],
  "suggested_remediation": "Upgrade to Group-Office community 4.0.90."
