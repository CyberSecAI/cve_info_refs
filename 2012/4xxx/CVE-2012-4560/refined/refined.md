{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in libssh's buffer handling and string manipulation functions due to incorrect checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper overflow checks in buffer.c when calculating buffer sizes.",
      "Integer overflows in buffer allocation and string operations.",
      "Incorrect size checks in `buffer_add_data()`, `buffer_prepend_data()`, `buffer_pass_bytes()`, `buffer_pass_bytes_end()`, `buffer_get_mpint()`." ,
        "Integer overflows in `ssh_get_hexa()` and `ssh_string_to_char()`"
    ],
    "impact": "The flaws could potentially lead to denial of service due to large memory allocation followed by immediate deallocation. While not immediately exploitable for code execution according to the report, the flawed checks do represent a security risk.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted network traffic to trigger incorrect buffer handling and size calculations",
        "Exploiting the flawed logic in buffer and string functions to cause large memory allocations"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system using a vulnerable version of libssh, or trigger the flawed buffer allocation through another means"
