| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=856743#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-12 17:42:24 UTC  ``` A stack based buffer overflow flaw was found in guac client plug-in protocol handling functionality of libguac, a common library used by all C components of Guacamole. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted protocol specification to the guac client plug-in that, when processed would lead to guac client crash (denial of service).

Subject: CVE id request: guacd

Hi,
there is a buffer overflow in the protocol handling of guacd.
This issue is confirmed to result in code execution.
Upstream fix:
<http://guac-dev.org/trac/changeset/7dcefa744b4a38825619c00ae8b47e5bae6e38c0/libguac>

Can we please get a CVE id for this issue?

Kind regards
Nico
