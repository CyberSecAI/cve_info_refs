| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=857242#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-13 22:08:45 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds read error was reported [1] in OpenSLP's SLPIntersectStringList() function (in common/sip_compare.c) when processing service requests.

# USN-2730-1: OpenSLP vulnerabilities

3 September 2015

OpenSLP could be made to crash if it received specially crafted network
traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [openslp-dfsg](/security/cves?package=openslp-dfsg) - OpenSLP development libraries

## Details

Georgi Geshev discovered that OpenSLP incorrectly handled processing

certain service requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue

to cause OpenSLP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-4428](/security/CVE-2012-4428))

Qinghao Tang discovered that OpenSLP incorrectly handled processing certain

messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

OpenSLP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5177](/security/CVE-2015-5177))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=778508#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2012-09-03 13:44:08 UTC  ``` Via private SECUNIA mail:   We have confirmed the vulnerability in version 1.2.1.  Details: ---------  The vulnerability is caused due to an out-of-bounds read error within the "SLPIntersectStringList()" function (common/slp_compare.c) when processing service requests and can be exploited to cause a crash via a specially crafted request.  ---------  Please find the PoC attached.  Please acknowledge receiving this e-mail and let us know when you expect to fix the vulnerability. Credits should go to: "Georgi Geshev via Secunia SVCRP".  A copy of the Secunia Research Disclosure Policy can be located here: <http://secunia.com/community/research/policy/> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=778508#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2012-09-03 22:00:25 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=778508#c3)  Matthias Weckbecker   2012-09-10 09:16:54 UTC  ``` Note: At the time of writing there is unfortunately no CRD available.

This could be exploited to cause a crash via a specially-crafted request.  The report is against version 1.2.1, however other versions may be affected.  There is not yet any upstream patch or bug report.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-09-13 16:26:17 UTC  ``` Description Georgi Geshev has discovered a vulnerability in OpenSLP, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).  The vulnerability is caused due to an out-of-bounds read error within the "SLPIntersectStringList()" function (common/slp_compare.c) when processing service requests and can be exploited to cause a crash via a specially crafted request.  The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.2.1. Other versions may also be affected.   Solution No official solution is currently available. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  ta2002    2013-07-01 00:52:18 UTC  ``` I was going to file a separate "version bump" bug, but after finding this one, it seems more efficient to just add that information here.  Openslp 2.0.0 was recently released (first release in more than eight years), which likely will have a solution for this problem. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andreas K. Hüttel   archtester gentoo-dev  2013-07-12 20:28:28 UTC  ``` I've added 2.0.0 to the tree, however I cannot test it at all, so NO KEYWORDS.   Will need full re-keywording. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-03-01 10:03:08 UTC  ``` Debian patch: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=27;filename=CVE-2012-4428.patch;att=1;bug=687597> .  @maintainers, Please patch and confirm that 2.0.0 is no longer affected.  Request stabilization in this bug when ready. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-11-21 20:01:20 UTC  ``` @ Maintainer(s): According to <https://sourceforge.net/p/openslp/mercurial/ci/34fb3aa5e6b4997fa21cb614e480de36da5dbc9a/log/?path=/openslp/common/slp_compare.c> upstream has never patch SLPContainsStringList function which contains the vulnerability.  So please pick-up Debian's version and report upstream. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Andreas K. Hüttel   archtester gentoo-dev  2017-02-18 19:11:21 UTC  ``` Strangely this issue was never addressed in 2.0.0 (not even in the upstream hg repository).  I've forward-ported the patch (one chunk needed adapting since someone creatively re-arranged {brack{}ets}, one chunk isn't needed anymore since the code has been independently rewritten).   Added in net-libs/openslp-2.0.0-r3. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Andreas K. Hüttel   archtester gentoo-dev  2017-02-18 19:16:48 UTC  ``` See also: <https://sourceforge.net/p/openslp/bugs/156/> ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2017-05-21 02:49:50 UTC  ``` Added to an existing GLSA Request. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Andreas K. Hüttel   archtester gentoo-dev  2017-06-09 23:11:23 UTC  ``` Nothing to do for printing here anymore. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2017-07-08 12:35:19 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201707-05 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201707-05> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ``` |  |

Hi,

there has also been an upstream bug report filed [1].

Might be reasonable to check back there from time to time. No patch
yet, unfortunately.

Cheers,

I had a look at this yesterday. The buffer-handling in libslp *looks*
suspect to me (in terms of tracking lengths of text fields etc.), but
I can't see an easy way to reproduce the bug here to verify my
suspicions. I've followed up on the upstream bug to ask about this.

In the meantime, even if the code looks dodgy I *don't* see it as
being particularly likely to be exploitable, more a DoS at worst, and
only on a local-network basis rather than truly remote. I'm dropping
severity from grave accordingly - feel free to re-raise if you think
I'm wrong.

I was preparing a QA upload, and took a stab at this. Here's the patch
I'm going to include. It seems pretty clear that if the previous to last
character in the string-list is '\\' then the string-list handling
functions will keep going, when they probably should only have done so
on escaped ','.

Although I've only code-stared at the issue, and my later few attempts
to reproduce this have been unsuccessful, but I've to confess I've not
tried very hard. Given this I'm a bit hesitant to close this bug with
the upload, but I guess I'll do so if I don't hear complains, in a
couple of days. :)

If any of you could either test or review this, that would be much
appreciated!

Thanks,
Guillem

Distribution: unstable
Urgency: low
Maintainer: Debian QA Group <packages@qa.debian.org>
Changed-By: Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>
Description:
 libslp-dev - OpenSLP development files
 libslp1    - OpenSLP shared library
 openslp-doc - OpenSLP documentation
 slpd       - OpenSLP server (slpd)
 slptool    - OpenSLP command line tool
Closes: [687597](bugreport.cgi?bug=687597) [755935](bugreport.cgi?bug=755935)
Changes:
 openslp-dfsg (1.2.1-10) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * QA upload.
   * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes needed).
   * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 9.
   * Switch to machine-parseable copyright format.
   * Reorder binary package stanzas in debian/control.
   * Split common and specific package descriptions into distinct paragraphs
     so that translations are easier.
   * Reword package summaries.
   * Mark slpd and slptool as Multi-Arch:foreign, libslp1 and libslp-dev as
     Multi-Arch:same. Closes: #[755935](bugreport.cgi?bug=755935)
   * Clean up debian/rules:
     - Explicitly set DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE.
     - Remove unused DEB_BUILD_GNU_SYSTEM and DEB_BUILD_GNU_CPU assignments.
     - Remove commented out debhelper commands.
     - Do not pass any argument to update-rc.d via dh_installinit.
     - Pass --host and --build to configure only when cross-compiling.
     - Pass --disable-silent-rules to configure, preemptively.
     - Enable hardening build flags.
   * Clean up init script:
    - Update LSB header descriptions.
    - Add LSB status action support.
    - Rename debian/init.d to debian/slpd.init.
    - Add new PIDFILE variable.
   * Remove unnecessary debian/dirs, dh_installinit takes care of creating the
     etc/init.d directory.
   * Remove debian/preinst, as it was wrongly using start-stop-daemon directly,
     and invoke-rc.d is already being injected by debhelper to stop the daemon
     on upgrade.
   * Remove «set -x» from slpd postinst.
   * Namespace stray debhelper files with «slpd.» in debian/ filenames.
   * Remove trailing spaces from debian/ files.
   * Change the libcrypto configure-time checks conditional on whether it is
     going to be used at build time, so that we can remove the libssl-dev
     Build-Conflicts.
   * Add a debian/watch file.
   * Add a basic symbols file for libslp1.
   * Fix a typo in slptool's program output message.
   * Fix a typo in an automake coditional in the code, that was not properly
     disabling the code (ENABLE_SLPV2_SECURITY → ENABLE_SLPv2_SECURITY).
   * Fix handling of string-list in common/slp_common.c by not increasing
     the item pointer past the string-list pointer, and letting '\\' only
     escape the item separator ','. Although not reproduced it should in
     theory fix [CVE-2012-4428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4428). Closes: #[687597](bugreport.cgi?bug=687597)

```
Package: openslp-dfsg

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.8) - use target "oldstable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

Thanks,

with his security hat on:
