- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A crafted request sent to the Cognos server by a malicious user triggers high CPU utilization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Unspecified vulnerability leading to excessive CPU consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Partial denial of service condition due to high CPU utilization, which may impact the performance of the Cognos application. The denial of service is temporary and does not block access for other users.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to the Cognos server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of IBM Cognos BI 8.4.
