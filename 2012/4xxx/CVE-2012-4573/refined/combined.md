How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

```
Because we rely on the registry to determine authorization in the glance
v1 api, we must attempt a registry delete before deleting an image from
the image store.

This patch includes the test for the bug, which was posted separately
on the bug.

Fixes bug 1065187.

```
Because we rely on the registry to determine authorization in the glance
v1 api, we must attempt a registry delete before deleting an image from
the image store.

This patch includes the test for the bug, which was posted separately
on the bug.

Fixes bug 1065187.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1558)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix multiple bugs and add various
enhancements are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Essex.

## Description

The openstack-glance packages allows virtual machine images to be discovered,
registered and retrieved. It also includes a RESTful API to provide these
services to other applications.

The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2012.1.2,
which provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.

A flaw in Keystone allowed an attacker with access to the web and network
interfaces to delete arbitrary, non-protected images from Glance servers.
(CVE-2012-4573)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Gabe Westmaas as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-4573.

All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which fix these bugs and add these enhancements. After installing the updated
packages, the Glance services (openstack-glance-api and
openstack-glance-registry) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the Red
Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

### Bug Description

Given a public, non-protected image, a non-admin user can issue a delete against that image which may delete the image from the backend storage repository. The client will get a 403 unauthorized response, but the backend delete method is called prior to checking for those permissions on the glance registry.

Delete from store after registry delete.

Because we rely on the registry to determine authorization in the glance

    v1 api, we must attempt a registry delete before deleting an image from

    the image store.

Fixes [bug 1065187](/bugs/1065187).

Also two precisions on impact, so that we can draft the description correctly:

\* you mention "non-protected images", could you elaborate on the class of images that are vulnerable ? Does it mean any image on non-read-only backends ? Or is there a way to "protect" images on read/write backends ?

\* you mention "may delete the image", but from the looks of the code it looks like vulnerable ("non-protected") images would always get deleted by a delete request ?

I think I can help fill in the gaps.

Images have an attribute called "protected" which, if true, prevents them from being deleted. Since modifying protected to set it to False does have the appropriate authorization checks, protected images cannot be deleted from the backend storage in this way.

If a user submits a delete to an image they can see (but shouldn't be able to delete), they indeed \*always\* cause the image data to be deleted from the backend store unless the image has protected == True.

Also, from my assessment of the code, this particular bug potentially goes back a very long way to when the registry and api code were first integrated in commit fba60c3a588ccbae61e3ba8cf6558efc36d116a5 on December 13 2010.

However, it is also possible that authorization checking code was removed from glance.store at some point. I haven't been able to track that down yet.

Essex has:

<https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/7fdccb1ada360b0ba8b69472477c5cedfa45bcda/glance/api/v1/images.py#L710>

So unless req.context.read\_only is set on non-admin requests, I guess it's vulnerable, please confirm.

Diablo has:

<https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/5b26c53c8e5143de37e270146d4ea9755c5c3f32/glance/api/v1/images.py#L598>

which is very similar to Essex, so if Essex is vulnerable, Diablo will be.

Looks like a workaround for Folsom (apart from setting all images to protected) would be to refuse v1 API (enable\_v1\_api = False) as this seems to be v1-specific ?

OK, time to make progress on this... adding glance-core to the mix.

We need from Glance core:

\* Formal pre-approval on the proposed patch (comment 8) -- currently it has one +1 from Brian

\* confirmation that Diablo and Essex are vulnerable

\* backported patches for Essex if vulnerable

Then the VMT will:

\* Draft an impact description

\* Pull stable/diablo team in if Diablo is affected

\* Push the proposed fixes downstream

Just looking at the code Essex (and Diablo) seem to be vulnerable in case you don't use delayed\_delete. If you do, the code will return 403 but I'm not sure it won't still delete the image (after the delay) ?

Hi Thierry, which stable/diablo code path is vunerable?

I think this bit is ok:

def schedule\_delete\_from\_backend(uri, options, context, image\_id, \*\*kwargs):

    """

    Given a uri and a time, schedule the deletion of an image.

    """

    use\_delay = config.get\_option(options, 'delayed\_delete', type='bool',

                                  default=False)

    if not use\_delay:

        registry.update\_image\_metadata(options, context, image\_id,

                                       {'status': 'deleted'}) <<< if delayed delete is disabled we'll hit this -- which I think will fail with not authorized.

        try:

            return delete\_from\_backend(uri, \*\*kwargs)

        except (UnsupportedBackend, exception.NotFound):

            msg = \_("Failed to delete image from store (%(uri)s).") % locals()

            logger.error(msg)

registry.update\_image\_metadata(options, context, image\_id,

                                   {'status': 'pending\_delete'}) <<< if delayed delete is enabled we'll hit this -- which I think will fail with not authorized.

@Stuart: I fear that in the latter scenario we'll have executed delete\_from\_backend() -- the 403 will just prevent you from also erasing metadata. But harm will have been done already... Or do I miss something ? I'm not exactly a Glance expert ;)

Hmm, the formatting for my post got lost -- sorry.

In "schedule\_delete\_from\_backend" the "delete\_from\_backend" is indented so its part of the 'if not use\_delay' conditional. My reading of this is that that whole if block will get skipped when delayed delete is switched on. We'll then hit the line where an attempt to set 'pending\_delete' is made, and -- as far as I can tell -- get a not authorized at that point.

Am I reading this wrong/is there another path that takes us to 'delete\_from\_backend()'?

Thanks.

No, I think you're right, was mislead by indenting. Diablo sounds unaffected, and Essex affected. Another pair of eyes on that analysis couldn't hurt.

I confirmed that this does affect Essex. An authenticated user can force a delete to be scheduled for an image he does not own if it is public or has been explicitly shared with him. The vulnerability does not apply in the case that delayed\_delete is disabled.

I'd reword the last sentence. My thinking is that the 'delayed\_delete' bit only matters on Essex:

Folsom/Grizzly deployments that expose the v1 API are affected by this vulnerability. Essex deployments that use delayed\_delete are also affected.

It looks like we're all set on approvals now. The next step is deciding on a release date and doing the advance notification.

How about Wednesday, November 7th?

Thierry, would you like to send out the advance notification on this? Let me know and I'll push it out if you'd like.

In the future, try using "git format-patch" to export commits for posting to bugs. That makes it a whole lot easier to merge (using git am). :-)

Delete from store after registry delete.

Because we rely on the registry to determine authorization in the glance

    v1 api, we must attempt a registry delete before deleting an image from

    the image store.

This patch includes the test for the bug, which was posted separately

The advisory (OSSA 2012-017) has been posted.

Unfortunately, not all of the patches made it through jenkins today. The patches for master and stable/folsom did. The patch for stable/essex did not. First it was blocked by the sqlalchemy upgrade. Pinning the sqlalchemy version got merged into stable/essex. Now the patch is blocked by a failure in tempest. The advisory just includes a link to the gerrit review for stable/essex.

It would be great if the glance guys could help get this patch pushed through for stable/essex.

@jamie: did the patch merged to stable/folsom finally solve it for you ? Looks like the tests passed on the final merge...

FWIW, we are working on setting up a private Gerrit instance so that we can review and test the security patches more effectively. The current "attach patch, +1 and pray" approach really sucks and we know it.

@Thierry: no, I was using that final commit. After some investigation I discovered I also needed to patch the testsuite with 7841cc93050fa48a1fbd8847cec887f0360be9a3 ('FakeAuth not always admin'). Now the testsuite passes. Thanks.
