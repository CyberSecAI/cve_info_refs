  "CVE-2012-4573": {
    "description": "Authenticated users may be able to delete arbitrary, non-protected images from Glance servers.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that Glance performs backend image deletion before checking if the user has the required permissions to delete it. This was happening in the v1 API for Folsom and Grizzly and when delayed_delete was enabled for Essex.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Incorrect order of operations."
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated users can delete arbitrary, non-protected images, causing data loss and service disruption.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the Glance v1 API endpoint."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment and able to reach the Glance v1 API endpoint."
  }
}
