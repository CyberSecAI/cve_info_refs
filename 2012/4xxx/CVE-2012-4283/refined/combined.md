How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## FAQ

### Language/Translation Support

Login With AJAX is fully translated in over 20 languages, partially translated in many more! Our translations are maintained by volunteers, you can also contribute to these translations.

To view translated languages avaialble or to contribute translations in your language, visit the [WordPress translation portal](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/login-with-ajax/). Any translated languages over 90% will be automatically installed with the plugin, for other languages not fully translated, see below:

If not, you can also manually install this, we’ll use Russian as an example:

1. Find your language on the [translate.wordpress.org project page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/login-with-ajax/), and click on either the stable or development column percentage.
2. Click the ‘Export’ link at the bottom of the page, but select ‘All Current’ and the (.mo) file format, save the downloaded file.
3. Rename that file in the format of login-with-ajax-LANG.mo, where LANG = your language locale, for example russian is ru\_RU so you’d get `login-with-ajax-ru_RU.mo`
4. Upload that file to the `wp-content/languages/plugins` folder on your WordPress installation.
5. Your Login With Ajax plugin should now be translated partially into your language.

We suggest you contribute to the WordPress translation project page, anyone with a registered wordpress.org account can suggest new translations!

### I’m Upgrading from v3 to v4, what should I watch out for?

Generally speaking, the majority of users will have a seamless upgrade, and go into ‘legacy mode’ to help with the transition.

### Do I need Pro to get a great login experience?

Absolutely not! We have been providing a freely supported and maintained plugin since 2009(!), and have every intention on keeping it that way; a great and comprehensive login plugin with beautiful AJAX effects with solid support on free support forums.

We do not intend to limit any sort of functionality in the free version, quite the opposite, we hope to improve it over time as we have done so since the start.

That said, doing so takes a lot of time and work, therefore we’re offering a Pro version with *additional features* to enhance the login/registration experience and secure your site, along with a more dedicated level of support which we can’t offer on the wordpress.org forums. This will enable us to not only keep adding new features, but also maintain a freely supported plugin.

### Something isn’t working, what do I do?

Check out our [troubleshooting](https://docs.loginwithajax.com/troubleshooting/) and [FAQ](https://docs.loginwithajax.com/faq/) sections, they’re both a great place to start. Our [documentation](https://docs.loginwithajax.com) is also likely to answer your questions concering initial setup and customization, if not you can obtain support via our free forums or get in touch directly as a Pro customer.

### Where do I go for support?

We recommend first visiting our [documentation site](https://docs.loginwithajax.com) which includes a troubleshooting section. IF you have a question or comment, we’re available both on our [community forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/login-with-ajax/) which we monitor regularly, as well as our [Pro support](https://loginwithajax.com/gopro/) for dedicated one-to-one support.
