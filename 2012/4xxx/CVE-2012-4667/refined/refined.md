It appears that [3] is an XSS issue, so this needs a separate CVE because
it's a different type of encoding problem than [2].

Use CVE-2012-4667 for the XSS.

- Steve
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient escaping of URLs in CGI scripts within SquidClamav.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of URL escaping in CGI scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the context of the web application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed when a victim visits a page that uses the vulnerable CGI script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL that is then accessed by a user of the vulnerable web application.
