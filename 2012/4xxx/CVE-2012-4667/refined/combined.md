It appears that [3] is an XSS issue, so this needs a separate CVE because
it's a different type of encoding problem than [2].

Use CVE-2012-4667 for the XSS.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-07-31 09:07:23 UTC  ``` Description A vulnerability has been reported in SquidClamav, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).  The vulnerability is caused due to an error when parsing a URL, which may result in unescaped URLs to be passed to the system command call. This can be exploited to cause the daemon to crash via specially crafted characters (e.g. %0D or %0A).  The vulnerability is reported in versions prior to 5.8 and 6.7.   Solution Update to version 5.8 or 6.7. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-07-31 09:07:46 UTC  ``` ok to stabilize 6.8 ? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-07-31 13:52:44 UTC  ``` Ok for me. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-07-31 14:24:36 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =net-proxy/squidclamav-6.8 Target KEYWORDS : "amd64 x86" ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jeff (JD) Horelick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-01 07:07:37 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-08-01 09:46:56 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-08-01 09:48:29 UTC  ``` security, please vote. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-14 15:48:34 UTC  ``` Thanks, everyone.

Subject: CVE Request: SquidClamav insufficient escaping flaws

Hi Kurt,

It appears that this has not yet received a CVE:

The upstream notification [1] shows SquidClamav 5.8 and 6.7 fixes a URL
escaping issue which could lead to a daemon crash [2]. SquidClamav 5.8
also fixes escaping issues in CGI scripts [3].

  [### TortoiseSVN](/projects/tortoisesvn/)

  An Apache SVN client, right where you need it most

  TortoiseSVN is a Subversion (SVN) client, implemented as a windows shell extension. Which means it's available right where you need it: in the Windows file explorer.
  It's intuitive and easy to use, since it doesn't require the Subversion command line client to run. Simply the coolest Interface to (Sub)Version Control!

  [![libjpeg-turbo](//a.fsdn.com/allura/p/libjpeg-turbo/icon?1705164186?&w=120 "libjpeg-turbo")](/projects/libjpeg-turbo/)

  [### libjpeg-turbo](/projects/libjpeg-turbo/)

  SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library

  libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.
  libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API. libjpeg-turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.

  [### SWIG](/projects/swig/)

  A code generator for connecting C/C++ with other programming languages

  SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language, Java, Lua, OCaml, Octave, R and Scilab. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML.

## Open Source Software Development Software Guide

Open source software development is a type of software which is published under an open source license, and its source code made available for free to the public. Open source projects typically involve the collaboration of developers from around the world who are able to freely modify, improve, and build upon each other's work. This creates unique opportunities for developers to share their knowledge and skills with each other while increasing their collective expertise.

The main benefits of open source software development include enhanced flexibility, speed of development, greater freedom to adjust and customize code, broader reach with users, better quality control and reliability through community input, improved collaboration between different teams or organizations working on related tasks/projects, more cost-effective access to technology infrastructure as no need to purchase expensive commercial licenses. Additionally there is usually an increased support from peers in dealing with technical issues or compatibility problems stemming from different versions or non-standard implementations. For example when something doesn't work as expected someone can post on a public forum about it or dig into the project’s issue tracker for help from other contributors.

Open source projects are also highly organized, often following some form of hierarchical structure; making them easier for new users or software developers wanting to contribute quickly familiarize themselves with task being taken by others in the group along with finding areas where they can be most useful in order provide valuable assistance & feedback. In addition due to large number of potential participants contributing towards same goal (and competing against one another) rewards such as reputation points & leaderboard rankings become quite common which help encourage people stay active within communities & ensure much higher level engagement than other collaborative platforms like forums/chat rooms etc. Last but not least many open sourced projects have dedicated “code review” teams that conduct regular audits over programming logic & coding standards thus ensuring highest possible degree accuracy before any proposed changes make it into mainline version of product.

In short, open source software development offers numerous advantages over traditional closed-source solutions allowing those involved reap benefit both professionanly & personally through enhanced learning opportunity potential partnerships created during process itself.

## Features of Open Source Software Development Software

Open Source Software Development Software provides a variety of features that can be used to create, customize and manage software projects. These features include:

* **Version Control:** This feature allows developers to have full control over the changes made in their code. It helps them to keep track of all versions of their project and make sure that they are always up-to-date.
* **Debugging Tools:** Debugging tools provide an easy way for developers to identify errors in their code. This helps them quickly find and fix issues before they become major problems.
* **Automation Systems:** Automation systems are used to automate tasks such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, thus reducing the time spent on mundane tasks.
* **Documentation Generator:** Many open source software development tools come with a documentation generator which creates comprehensive documentation for each project automatically. This makes it easier for developers to understand how the code works without having to spend too much time reading through it manually.
* **Collaboration Features:** Open source software development tools usually include collaboration features which allow teams from multiple locations or organizations work together effectively on a single project. Some of these features include shared repositories, bug tracking systems, and discussion boards where team members can communicate with each other easily about their projects.
* **Security Controls:** Open source software development tools come with various security controls to protect projects from malicious attacks. These include firewalls, encryption technology, and access controls which can be used to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the project.

## Types of Open Source Software Development Software

* **Collaborative Software:** This type of open source software development allows multiple users to work collaboratively on a single project from different locations. Features such as version control, task management, code review and bug tracking are commonly included in these types of software.
* **Community-Based Development Models:** These open source development models rely heavily on the community for support and input into the design process. This can include forums, mailing lists, IRC channels or other forms of online collaboration where developers can share ideas and discuss how to improve the product over time.
* **Forked Projects:** A fork occurs when one developer creates their own version of an existing project by taking its code base and making modifications that they believe will improve it or make it more suitable for their needs. Other developers may then choose to further modify this “forked” version or create related projects based off of it.
* **Custom Software Solutions:** Open source software allows companies or individuals to customize programs to meet their specific needs without having to build everything from scratch. By using existing components developed by others, creating custom solutions becomes much easier than starting from nothing.
* **Mobile Platforms:** Open source mobile platforms like Android and Fire OS allow anyone with coding knowledge to develop applications for those operating systems relatively easily compared to closed source platforms like iOS or Windows Phone. These platforms have also grown in popularity due to their low cost and ease of use.
* **Cloud-Based Development:** Open source software that is built on top of cloud services provides developers with the ability to easily access data from any location, deploy applications quickly and manage them remotely. This type of development has become increasingly popular for its scalability and cost effectiveness.

## Open Source Software Development Software Advantages

* **Cost-Effective:** Unlike proprietary software, open source software development is free. There are no expensive license fees to pay or ongoing costs associated with using the software. This cost savings can be a major advantage for businesses and individuals alike.
* **Widely Available:** Open source software development is widely available online and can often be downloaded without any restrictions. This makes it easy to access wherever you are located and from whichever device you’re using.
* **Flexible:** The flexibility of open source software allows for easier customization according to user needs. With the use of different programming languages, developers can make adjustments that fit the specific requirements of their project more easily than with proprietary programs.
* **Reliability:** Since open source projects have multiple contributors working on them simultaneously, bugs tend to get discovered quickly, allowing them to be fixed faster than those in proprietary programs. The code is also considered “open source” meaning anyone has the ability to review it for any potential issues that may arise in the future.
* **Security:** Open Source projects benefit from having many individuals look at their code which means there’s less likely it will contain a harmful backdoor created by a malicious hacker or developer. Additionally, since developers have access to the underlying code they can make sure that weaknesses aren't present in it or spot any potential flaws before someone else does and takes advantage of them.
* **Support Community:** Due to its wide availability, there are large communities available online where users can ask questions about how something works or how best interact with open source software development platforms. Similarly, as these communities grow so do the support resources available which provides an always accessible pool of knowledge should you ever need help with anything related to coding in general (not just with your project).
* **Innovation:** Open source software development encourages innovation and collaboration on a global level. By encouraging developers all over the world to work together, more ideas can be created, implemented, tested and improved upon faster than with proprietary programs. This allows for projects that would normally require a large team of developers to move forward at a much faster rate.

## Types of Users That Use Open Source Software Development Software

* **Beginner Users:** Users new to open source software development, who are looking to explore and learn the basic principles of computer programming.
* **Experienced Developers:** Individuals with coding experience, who use open source software development tools as part of their daily workflows. They have a thorough understanding of the fundamentals and may modify existing code or create new programs from scratch.
* **Hobbyists:** People who enjoy tinkering with open source software in their spare time, often without having any formal training in Computer Science or Software Engineering.
* **Professional Programmers:** Those professionals whose job involves using open source software development on a regular basis. They are typically highly skilled and experienced developers writing custom solutions for clients or working on projects within corporate IT departments.
* **Corporate IT Departments:** Teams of individuals responsible for planning, developing and maintaining large-scale corporate networks and systems, who rely heavily on open source software development tools to customize solutions that fit into their organization’s infrastructure.
* **Designers:** Professionals tasked with the visual layout of software applications, who use open source tools to create aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.

## How Users Can Get Started With Open Source Software Development Software

Getting started with open source software development is relatively straightforward. The first step is to decide which type of open source software you want to use. There are a variety of open source programs available, ranging from simple word processors and image editors to more complex programming environments like Java or C++. Once you have selected the software you want to use, the next step is to download it. You can usually find these downloads on the website for the open source software project, or by searching an online repository.

Once your download is complete, install it on your computer just like any other program. Most open source projects provide either a graphical installation wizard that walks users through setting up the program, or clear instructions on how to manually set it up in the Readme file that comes with the download. After you’ve installed the program and opened it up for the first time, read any introductory tutorials that are provided by either community members or included in program documentation. This will help you quickly become familiar with how everything works and how to get started using it effectively before diving into more complicated tasks.

Finally, if you ever run into problems while working with an open source application, don't hesitate to reach out for help. Many projects have active discussion forums where people answer questions related to installing and using their software so if something isn't working properly or you can't figure out how to do something specific, feel free to search around and see if there's already an answer available. If not, you can also post your own question in the discussion and wait for one of the more experienced users to respond. With a little bit of searching and experimentation, you can soon be up and running with open source software development.
