{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `BuildTextRunsScanner::BreakSink::SetBreaks` function. During reflow, a text run is accessed after it has been deleted.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption. If exploited, an attacker can corrupt heap memory leading to potential code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the rendering of text using the layout engine.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to create a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerable code path. No specific user interaction beyond loading the page is described. A remote attacker could exploit this by tricking a user into opening a malicious web page."
