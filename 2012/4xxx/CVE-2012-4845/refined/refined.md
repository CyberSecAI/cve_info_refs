The provided content relates to CVE-2012-4845.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the AIX FTP client, where it improperly handles file access permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The FTP client allows a user to read files that they are not authorized to access. Specifically, a non-root user can potentially gain access to files intended only for root users. This is a violation of discretionary access control (DAC).

**Impact of exploitation:**
A non-root user can read files that should only be accessible to the root user, leading to unauthorized information disclosure and potentially other security issues.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the standard use of the ftp client on AIX. A non-root user could use the ftp client to attempt to access files they shouldn't have access to.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a non-root user on an affected AIX system and be able to utilize the FTP client.
