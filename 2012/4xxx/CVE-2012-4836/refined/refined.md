Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4836:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user-supplied input within IBM Cognos BI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when a victim views the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can inject malicious script into a web page.
- When a victim views this page, the script executes within the victim's web browser, in the security context of the hosting website. This could lead to:
    - Stealing of session cookies if the httpOnly attribute isn't set.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Other actions malicious scripts are capable of.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker injects the malicious script through a user-supplied input field or parameter that lacks proper validation.
- The injected script is stored by the server.
- When a user accesses the web page where the injected script is rendered, the script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject input that will be stored by the application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, but the user viewing the page would have to be.
- The attacker needs no special position, but does need access to the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document provides CVSS base score of 3.5 and a link to the temporal score.
- The document recommends applying provided interim fixes to mitigate the vulnerability.
- As a mitigation, using the httpOnly attribute for the session cookie is recommended, although it only prevents stealing the session id.
