{
  "CVE-2012-4546": {
    "Description": "The current default configuration of IPA servers did not publish correct CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists). The default configuration specifies that every replica is to generate its own CRL, however this can result in inconsistencies in the CRL contents provided to clients from different Identity Management replicas. More specifically, if a certificate is revoked on one Identity Management replica, it will not show up on another Identity Management replica.",
    "Root cause": "The default configuration of IPA servers specifies that every replica generates its own CRL, leading to inconsistencies.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent CRLs across IPA replicas"
    ],
    "Impact": "Clients may receive incomplete or outdated CRLs from different IPA replicas. A revoked certificate might still be trusted due to a missing revocation entry on some replicas' CRLs.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker could potentially exploit inconsistencies in the CRLs by using a revoked certificate which is not marked as revoked in all CRLs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a revoked certificate and knowledge of IPA infrastructure and potential inconsistencies. An attacker can possibly try to connect through a replica with an outdated CRL.  "
