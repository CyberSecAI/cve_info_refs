How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: cgit: heap buffer overflow

Hey oss-sec,

The original author and maintainer of cgit, Lars Hjemli, has been MIA
for the last several months, and nobody I've talked to seems to know
what's happened. Because I've previously been involved with some cgit
things, I'm maintaining a tree of my own to which folks on the cgit
mailing list are now sending patches. It'd be a bit presumptuous to
call myself the new maintainer, but I am trying to keep the project
alive and healthy until Lars returns from wherever he is.

Jim Meyering from Redhat has written to the cgit mailing list with a
detailed analysis and a two line commit fixing a heap buffer overflow.
At the minimum, it's a denial of service, and in the worst case, it
might lead to to a remote shell. If anyone has any tricks on how to
exploit it successfully, I'd be interested to hear them.

You can read his analysis and look at the commit here [1] and a Redhat
bug report here [2].

If this oss-sec finds it concerning enough, I can tag a
non-Lars-approved release and post links to new tarballs for folks.
But there's a chance that exploitation isn't feasible, as Jim has
written in his report, in which case I'd like to hold off on making
any non-Lars-approved releases for a bit.

Thanks,
Jason

AFAICS, this is not exploitable thanks (ironically) to the use of strncpy. Since that -1 translates to SIZE_MAX and this is strncpy, not only does it copy whatever is in "head" (up to first NUL), but it also writes SIZE_MAX - strlen(head) NUL bytes into the destination buffer, and that latter is guaranteed to evoke a segfault.  Since cgit is single-threaded, AFAICS, there is no way that the buffer clobbering can be turned into an exploit.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c1)  Jim Meyering    2012-07-25 14:14:38 UTC  ``` FYI, posted upstream,    <http://hjemli.net/pipermail/cgit/2012-July/000652.html>  but afaics, still not on any branch in the git repository.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-01 16:56:02 UTC  ``` This needs to be corrected in all versions of Fedora and EPEL (not just rawhide).  Please see [bug #862035](show_bug.cgi?id=862035 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4465 cgit: specially-crafted commit can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow") for the security bug (CVE assignment pending).  I'm going to turn this into a tracking bug for all versions of Fedora.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c3)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-15 17:31:33 UTC  ``` cgit-0.9.1-1.fc18 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 18. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cgit-0.9.1-1.fc18>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c4)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-15 17:41:51 UTC  ``` cgit-0.9.1-1.fc17 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 17. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cgit-0.9.1-1.fc17>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c5)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-15 17:54:35 UTC  ``` cgit-0.9.1-1.fc16 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 16. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cgit-0.9.1-1.fc16>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c6)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-15 18:11:51 UTC  ``` cgit-0.9.1-1.el6 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 6. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cgit-0.9.1-1.el6>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c7)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-15 18:26:24 UTC  ``` cgit-0.9.1-1.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cgit-0.9.1-1.el5>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=820733#c8)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-15 19:32:59 UTC  ``` Package cgit-0.9.1-1.el6: * should fix your issue, * was pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 testing repository, * should be available at your local mirror within two days.
