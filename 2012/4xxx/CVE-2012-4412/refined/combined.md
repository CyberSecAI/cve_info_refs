Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

Subject: CVE Request -- glibc: strcoll() integer overflow leading to buffer
 overflow + another alloca() stack overflow issue (upstream #14547 &&
 #14552)

Hello Kurt, Steve, Florian, Jeff, Jakub, vendors,

1) Issue #1:
------------
  An integer overflow, leading to buffer overflow
flaw was found in the way the implementation of
strcoll() routine, used to compare two strings
based on the current locale, of glibc, the GNU
libc libraries, performed calculation of memory
requirements / allocation, needed for storage
of the strings. If an application linked against
glibc was missing an application-level sanity
checks for validity of strcoll() arguments and
accepted untrusted input, an attacker could use
this flaw to cause the particular application
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Upstream bug report (including reproducer):
[1] <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14547>

References:
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=855385>

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

2) Issue #2 (mentioned here only for completeness,
but I am not of the opinion this should receive a CVE
identifier. See argumentation below [but open to
glibc upstream / others to disprove it]).

alloca() stack overflow (first issue from the report below)
Upstream bug report:
[3] <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14552>

If I have looked correctly this is expected / known
behaviour of alloca() - from the manual page:
[4] <http://linux.die.net/man/3/alloca>

"Return Value
The alloca() function returns a pointer to the
beginning of the allocated space. If the allocation
causes stack overflow, program behavior is undefined."

Under my opinion the above description covers also the
case of 'alloca() stack overflow' as reported in bug [3].
Further opinions / upstream comments appreciated though.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=855385#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-07 14:59:00 UTC  ``` An integer overflow, leading to buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the implementation of strcoll() routine, used to compare two strings based on the current locale, of glibc, the GNU libc libraries, performed calculation of memory requirements / allocation, needed for storage of the strings. If an application linked against glibc was missing an application-level sanity checks for validity of strcoll() arguments and accepted untrusted input, an attacker could use this flaw to cause the particular application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

## Details

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled the strcoll()

function. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-4412](/security/CVE-2012-4412), [CVE-2012-4424](/security/CVE-2012-4424))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled multibyte

characters in the regular expression matcher. An attacker could use this

issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0242](/security/CVE-2013-0242))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled large numbers

of domain conversion results in the getaddrinfo() function. An attacker

could use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1914](/security/CVE-2013-1914))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library readdir\_r() function incorrectly

handled crafted NTFS or CIFS images. An attacker could use this issue to

cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2013-4237](/security/CVE-2013-4237))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled memory

allocation. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c0)  Joseph Myers    2012-09-05 20:59:31 UTC  ``` The code in string/strcoll_l.c that computes a memory allocation size as (s1len + s2len) * (sizeof (int32_t) + 1) fails to allow for possible integer overflow in this computation.  On a 32-bit host this can cause too-small allocations and consequent buffer overflow if the strings total more than 0.8GB.  Testcase:  #include <locale.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h>  #define SIZE 429496730  int main (void) {   char *p = malloc (1 + SIZE);   if (setlocale (LC_COLLATE, "en_GB.UTF-8") == NULL)     {       puts ("setlocale failed, cannot test for overflow");       return 0;     }   if (p == NULL)     {       puts ("malloc failed, cannot test for overflow");       return 0;     }   memset (p, 'x', SIZE);   p[SIZE] = 0;   printf ("%d\n", strcoll (p, p));   return 0; } ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c1)  Joseph Myers    2012-09-05 21:12:50 UTC  ``` It looks like the same issue is also present in strxfrm (not tested). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c2)  Joseph Myers    2012-09-06 16:54:00 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 14552](show_bug.cgi?id=14552 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Two security issues in strcoll() function") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c3)  Rich Felker    2012-09-08 03:38:25 UTC  ``` Although this bug report regards the serious security vuln in strcoll, even if the overflow issues are fixed, a serious bug will remain. The strcoll interface does not permit failure. It must yield a consistent ordering. If it can fail sporadically from memory exhaustion, it can cause other interfaces using it (such as qsort) which rely on it to be a consistent ordering to invoke undefined behavior. While an immediate security fix is needed for the issues reported here, the implementation of strcoll calls for drastic redesign to be completely free of malloc or any other operation that could fail. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c4)  Shaun Colley    2012-09-11 09:53:33 UTC  ``` I've detailed another strcoll() security vulnerability below, which is an unbounded alloca() call.   alloca() stack overflow  If the malloc() call in alloca() fails (i.e. OOM conditions), strcoll() will failsafe to alloca() for allocating its memory, which could result in unbounded alloca() calls and exploitable conditions if the stack pointer is shifted over the guard area and into the heap. See vulnerable code below.          if (idx1arr == NULL)        /* No memory.  Well, go with the stack then.            XXX Once this implementation is stable we will handle this           differently.  Instead of precomputing the indeces we will           do this in time.

For very large string     inputs, the cache size computation could overflow.  In such a case,     use the fallback function that does not cache indices and weights of     collation sequences.          Fixes CVE-2012-4412.  commit 141f3a77fe4f1b59b0afa9bf6909cd2000448883 Author: Siddhesh Poyarekar <siddhesh@redhat.com> Date:   Mon Sep 23 11:20:02 2013 +0530      Fall back to non-cached sequence traversal and comparison on malloc fail          strcoll currently falls back to alloca if malloc fails, resulting in a     possible stack overflow.  This patch implements sequence traversal and     comparison without caching indices and rules.          Fixes CVE-2012-4424. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c8)  mancha    2013-10-25 13:09:56 UTC  ``` Hello.

It should finish a few minutes before forever :)  The *_nocache code is O(n^3) (IIRC), so it's very very slow.  If it has to crash due to a buffer or stack overflow, it ought to be gone in a few minutes based on some arbitrary tests I did by introducing buffer overflows and accesses beyond bounds in the code.  I've added an xtest (i.e. an optional test, which you can run using `make xcheck`) that does exactly this - run the reproducer and signal a success if the program doesn't crash in about five minutes.  If you want to do a correctness test then I'd suggest commenting out the get_next_seq_cached paths so that get_next_seq_nocache is called all the time and then run your usual strcoll correctness tests.  Maybe we could add some internal test hooks that allow us to do this seamlessly. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c11)  mancha    2013-10-25 15:03:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Siddhesh Poyarekar from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c10)) > It should finish a few minutes before forever :) >  > The *_nocache code is O(n^3) (IIRC), so it's very very slow.  Hi. Thanks for your quick reply. With that kind of complexity I'll adopt your heuristic: if no failure in 5 minutes, assume success.  > If you want to do a correctness test then I'd suggest commenting out the > get_next_seq_cached paths so that get_next_seq_nocache is called all the > time and then run your usual strcoll correctness tests.  Thanks for the suggestion, I'll force get_next_seq_nocache and run my strcoll faithfulness tests. ```   [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=14547#c12)  Jackie Rosen    2014-02-16 19:41:09 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` *** Bug 260998 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Seen from the domain <http://volichat.com> Page where seen: <http://volichat.com/adult-chat-rooms> Marked for reference.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
According to the vendor, the following versions are affected:
* 852-303: <v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: <v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: <v1.1.5.S0

            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.
