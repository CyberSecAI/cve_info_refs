  "summary": "The provided documents confirm the existence of multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Shockwave Player, specifically version 11.6.7.637 and earlier. The root cause lies within the Shockwave Player itself and its Xtra components. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker who can execute arbitrary code on a user's system by convincing them to open a specially crafted document.  The vulnerabilities are present on both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. The documents mention the use of malicious HTML pages, emails, Microsoft Office documents, and any other document that supports embedded Shockwave content as possible attack vectors."
