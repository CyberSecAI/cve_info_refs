Pickle is insecure in a model where an untrusted user can provide the pickled data. In the Swift model the data is pickled by Swift itself and stored in memcache, so the attack vector would suppose direct write access by an untrusted user to memcached data ?

Ok, however the metadata is constructed with user data, e.g. 'self.name'. I hope its not possible

to do inlining tricks with that.

(Its also used directly to loads from the replicator, but I guess someone should not be able to

trigger such requests (but mind header injection attacks via proxy)).

Since we only unpickle data that was pickled by ourselves, I think we are safe from inlining. User-provided strings that get pickled+unpickled remain strings.

That said, I'd love to hear from Swift devs what type of complex data is actually stored pickled: depending on the answer we could use something a bit less powerful (like JSON), reducing the attack surface.

Regarding the attack vector via memcache mentioned in comment #1, AFAIK every local user has access to memcached because there is not authC in place to stop her/him.

I am not that familiar with the openstack architecture, so...

- Where does the memcached run exactly?

- And does it only listen to 127.0.0.1?

memcached on Swift runs on every proxy servers and shared a cache so it bind on the internal network ip. For swift we always assume that the internal network needs to be secure since Swift has been designed this way.

It's not an immediate security risk, since the pickle data can't be modified by external users. But it could let someone e.g. escalate a network compromise into arbitrary code execution.

I've looked at switching some of the pickle serialization to json, but it's pretty fiddly and will take time to get right.

So we all agree that this is not directly exploitable in Swift current security model, but it would be a very welcome improvement to serialize to something less potentially harmful ?

If yes, I'd suggest we open this bug to the public as a welcome security strengthening issue (rather than keep it as an embargoed exploitable vulnerability).

Thomas/Sebastian: do you agree ?

I can agree with the reduced severity due to the attack vector and the additional steps needed.

I wish I could agree to the conclusion that this is not a vulnerability. It is a privilege escalation; an abuse is possible that crosses privilege boundaries to execute system commands.

The open question for me is only the level of impact. How likely is it to gain access to the internal network for an external attacker or an untrusted customer/user using a VM instance? What I heard from Sebastian is that it is really hard to separate the network if the attacker is an untrusted customer using a VM to execute network-level attacks.

Additionally Sebastian mentioned some ideas about alternative attack vectors in comment #2.

Sebastian, did you try to follow this ideas?

I also would not trust the authenticated user because OpenStack, by default, supports only password-based authentication and is at least vulnerable to brute force attacks.

So, for me it is a vulnerability with an yet unknown impact level.

The attack could be mitigated using authentication for memcached.

Are you speaking from nova to swift ? Usually the private networks

would be on different networks between nova and swift only the proxy

will be exposed to the VM and the memcached services will be only

listening to the private interface on the Swift side and due not

exposed to the VMs.

Ok, so theres no immediate impact, yet its probably still worth considering to replace pickle

by something that cannot execute commands in de-serialization.

Um, I just realized that we talked about 2 different attack vectors.

First, pickle is used in the backend to store and load data to/from extended attributes from

files inside read\_metadata(). Thats not nice, but not a severe issue if nobody can mod the xattrs.

Then, I just realized that pickle is also used in the memcache part. As memcached is distributed

over a lot of nodes and has no authentication, except your mentioned separation into

a private LAN, this is worse than the above case.

The swift proxy runs as root (is that necessary anyways, after binding to a low port?) and potentially

unpickles anything that he gets. If just someone polluted the memcached with evil pickle data.

I see your private LAN argument, but my experience in network consulting unfortunally shows me that

there is often no such strict separation so that memcached cannot be accessed from the VM/cloud network.

However, I am not exactly sure how to handle that without too much efforts.

E.g. an attacker from the VM or 'outside network' could send bogus ARP packets to the swift proxy,

polluting his ARP cache so that any connect() to an internal memcache IP will end at the attacker who can then

send any response to proxie's memcache.get() and trigger the pickle.

I think it will make a lot of headache to the network admin to nail down such things.

I am not really deep into the internals of WSGI, but would it be easily possible to drop

UID to a nova-user and/or chroot to /var/run/nova once swift proxy started? Or is that a problem

with python's importings?

I've been looking at the use of pickle on the memcache side only, and it looks to me that moving to JSON there shouldn't be an issue -- I don't see any of the user calling it with really complex object types.

The only issue I can see with the default encoder/decoder is that some types will be changed after serialization/deserialization (for instance, tuples become lists, str becomes unicode, etc.). But I don't think it's something that will be a problem in the code.

As to the use of SASL for memcached: I'm not sure we want to implement that ourselves in our small memcache client : handling sasl, and moving to the binary protocal for memcache would have to be dealt with (not sure how easy it is to do sasl in python). We could instead use pylibmc (<http://sendapatch.se/projects/pylibmc/>) which wraps libmemcached and provides sasl support if the library was built with sasl.

What would be the preferred way here?

  [Edit](/swift/%2Bbug/1006414/%2Battachment/3198826)
  (7.1 KiB,
  text/plain)

Here's a patch to use JSON instead of pickle for the memcache client. Moving to SASL will still be something worth the effort after that, but that's a first step, I guess.

This needs some more serious testing, as I'm unsure I correctly checked that all users of memcache are using simple-enough object types.

Also, as I wasn't sure that getting unicode when loading strings from json was good, I wrapped things to get str instead. I'm assuming we really always care only about utf8 (not sure this is a correct assumption, though).

Here's a patch to use JSON instead of pickle for the memcache client. Moving to SASL will still be something worth the effort after that, but that's a first step, I guess.

Didn't get a clear answer to my proposal of opening this bug to public.

The fact that access to Swift "trusted" internal network allows you to fully compromise Swift is well-known. The "internal" network in Swift is much less vulnerable than the Nova internal network, where VM network containment vulnerabilities are much more likely (that's why Nova doesn't rely on a trusted network). And if you drop privileges to the swift user (as you should), there is no particular escalation due to use of pickle.

So we are left with the fact that breaking into Swift "trusted" internal network allows you to compromise Swift. I'd welcome any change that prevents that (or gives you at least the option to run on untrusted internal network), but we are a bit far away from that: all Swift internal RPC also rely on a trusted internal network model. So I see no reason to keep the discussion on that closed. On the contrary, discussing it in a small group probably slows us down in improving that well-known state.

So unless someone disagrees in the next 48 hours, I will open up this bug to the public.

I see your point. But would be very nice to use Vincent's json patch (pickle seems really overload

for simple string dictionary storage anyway). For me its OK to

make this bug public.

Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON

We don't want to use pickle as it can execute arbitrary code. JSON is

    safer. However, note that it supports serialization for only some

    specific subset of object types; this should be enough for what we need,

    though.

To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache

    poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a

    memcache\_serialization\_support configuration option, with the following

    values:

0 = older, insecure pickle serialization

     1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)

     2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)

To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should

    upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24

    hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in

    future versions.

Part of [bug 1006414](/bugs/1006414).

I don't have a permission to see the proposed essex backport but IMHO patch as-is is not appropriate for the stable branch.

It should at least be modified to have memcache\_serialization\_support=0 as default to avoid surprises on upgrade!

BTW does Swift team maintain stable branch at all? Currently stable/essex branch == 1.4.8 tag and last I remember was that stable for Swift is not needed, quoting PTL from one stable/essex proposal: "taking into account that swift releases are frequent, prod-ready, and there is a migration path for them" <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/6619/>

Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON

```
We don't want to use pickle as it can execute arbitrary code. JSON is
safer. However, note that it supports serialization for only some
specific subset of object types; this should be enough for what we need,
though.

To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache
poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a
memcache_serialization_support configuration option, with the following
values:

 0 = older, insecure pickle serialization
 1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)
 2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)

To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should
upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24
hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in
future versions.

Part of bug 1006414.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Reason: With higher request queue length, fuse module can support more parallel fop requests (systemcalls). But when it is increased to higher value, there is more memory consumption, because more requests are queued up. There is no possible 'one value, fits all' type of solution here, hence we had to make it configurable to allow users to choose the right values based on use case, and their RAM size etc. Result (if any): New option is implemented for fuse module to provide queue length during mount time. | | | Clone Of: | [845214](show_bug.cgi?id=845214 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [FEAT] FUSE queue length needs to be configurable") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2013-03-28 22:25:39 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | | [Dependent Products:](page.cgi?id=fields.html#dependent_products "Other Products that are affected by this bug.") | Red Hat Ceph Storage Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager | |

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat OpenStack Essex.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Swift (<http://swift.openstack.org>) is a highly available,
distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store.

It was found that OpenStack Swift used the Python pickle module in an
insecure way to serialize and deserialize data from memcached. As
memcached does not have authentication, an attacker on the local network,
or possibly an unprivileged user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack,
could use this flaw to inject specially-crafted data that would lead to
arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2012-4406)

Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for
reporting this issue.

Note: The fix for CVE-2012-4406 is not enabled by default, and requires
manual action on the affected Proxy nodes. This update adds a
"memcache\_serialization\_support" option. It is configured in
"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" and is set to "0" by default. This default
setting is vulnerable to CVE-2012-4406.

To enable the fix, this option must be changed; however, the required
changes can have a temporary, large performance impact. The following
instructions aim to minimize performance issues:

1) Install the updated openstack-swift packages.

2) In "/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf", set the
"memcache\_serialization\_support" option in the memcache/[filter:cache]
section to "1". (The default value, "0", leaves you vulnerable to
CVE-2012-4406.) When set to "1", the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
format is used but pickle is still supported. This configuration is still
vulnerable, but new data will be stored in JSON format.

3) After setting the option to "1", run "service openstack-swift-proxy
restart".

4) After 24 hours, set the "memcache\_serialization\_support" option in
"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" to "2". "2" is the secure option: only JSON
is used.

5) After setting the option to "2", run "service openstack-swift-proxy
restart".

If "memcache\_serialization\_support" is set directly from "0" to "2", all
data in memcached will be flushed and re-created. This can lead to a
temporary, large performance impact.

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Subject: CVE-Request: openstack pickle de-serialization

Hi,

During openstack review we found that some parts of openstack
used pickle to de-serialize data. This could be used to execute
arbitrary code. Please check here:

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1006414](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/%2Bbug/1006414)

Can someone please assign a CVE, for completeness?

thx,
Sebastian

## Topic

Updated Red Hat Storage 2.0 packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add enhancements are now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Storage is a software only, scale-out storage solution that
provides flexible and agile unstructured data storage for the enterprise.

A flaw was found in the way the Swift component used Python pickle. This
could lead to arbitrary code execution. With this update, the JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) format is used. (CVE-2012-4406)

Multiple insecure temporary file creation flaws were found in Red Hat
Storage. A local user on the Red Hat Storage server could use these flaws
to cause arbitrary files to be overwritten as the root user via a symbolic
link attack. (CVE-2012-5635)

It was found that sanlock created "/var/run/sanlock/sanlock.pid" with
world-writable permissions. A local user could use this flaw to make the
sanlock init script kill an arbitrary process when the sanlock daemon is
stopped or restarted. Additionally, "/var/log/sanlock.log" was also
world-writable, allowing local users to modify the contents of the log
file, or store data within it (bypassing any quotas applied to their
account). (CVE-2012-5638)

Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for
reporting CVE-2012-4406. The CVE-2012-5635 issues were discovered by Kurt
Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team and Michael Scherer of the
Red Hat Regional IT team, and CVE-2012-5638 was discovered by David
Teigland of Red Hat.

Bug fixes and enhancements:

* Options to provide POSIX behavior when the O\_DIRECT flag is used with

the open() system call across many translators. (BZ#856156)

* A mount time option provided to make the FUSE module's request queue

length configurable. (BZ#856206)

* Various fixes in the FUSE module to ensure the 'read-only' (-o ro) mount

option works. (BZ#858499)

* Various fixes in GlusterFS's rebalance code to handle failures while

replica pairs are getting connected and disconnected in quick succession.
(BZ#859387)

* NFS code fixed to ensure proper inode transformation logic when the

'enable-ino32' option is set. (BZ#864222)

* Fixed the behavior of the posix-locks module per POSIX locking

semantics. As a result, smb-torture's ping-pong tests now run smoothly on
top of GlusterFS mounts. (BZ#869724)

* FUSE module enhanced with the enable-ino32 mount option, required by any

32-bit applications running on top of a GlusterFS mount. (BZ#876679)

* Corrections were made to fd table behavior when both NFS and

geo-replication are in progress. (BZ#880193)

* With this update, disconnections are now handled better in the

geo-replication 'gsyncd' process. (BZ#880308)

* With this update, the 'gluster volume geo-replication config checkpoint'

command returns the output value properly. (BZ#881736)

* With this enhancement, it is possible to set the 'root-squash' volume

option with Gluster CLI. Red Hat Storage volumes now support NFS's
root-squashing behavior. (BZ#883590)

* NFS POSIX lock issue fixed when 'root-squash' option is enabled on the

volume. (BZ#906884)

* Fixed an issue in tracking the changes of Geo-replication when an

unprivileged user accesses the file system. (BZ#883827)

* Fixed NFS locking manager (NLM) code to handle IP failover successfully.

(BZ#888286)

* Fixed issue in rebalance code to handle proper pointer dereference.

(BZ#894237)

* POSIX module made more robust to handle backend brick failures better.

(BZ#895841)

* Fixed the 'gluster volume geo-replication' command to provide a

meaningful message when a wrong hostname is entered. (BZ#902213)

* Fixed Console Configuration Script where it added invalid 'security'

configuration for ENGINEDataSource in JBoss. (BZ#922572)

* Fixed rhsc-setup failure where it does not check for SELinux before

running setsebool. (BZ#923674)

* Provided an update to the rhn-client-tools package to ensure setup

defaults to the correct base Red Hat Enterprise Linux (6.2 Extended Update
Support). (BZ#911777)

Refer to the Release Notes, available shortly from the link in the
References section, for further information.

Split from [bug 1005903](/bugs/1005903), from Sebastian Krahmer:

swift uses pickle to store and load meta data. pickle is insecure

and allows to execute arbitrary code in loads().

Pickle is insecure in a model where an untrusted user can provide the pickled data. In the Swift model the data is pickled by Swift itself and stored in memcache, so the attack vector would suppose direct write access by an untrusted user to memcached data ?

Ok, however the metadata is constructed with user data, e.g. 'self.name'. I hope its not possible

to do inlining tricks with that.

(Its also used directly to loads from the replicator, but I guess someone should not be able to

trigger such requests (but mind header injection attacks via proxy)).

Since we only unpickle data that was pickled by ourselves, I think we are safe from inlining. User-provided strings that get pickled+unpickled remain strings.

That said, I'd love to hear from Swift devs what type of complex data is actually stored pickled: depending on the answer we could use something a bit less powerful (like JSON), reducing the attack surface.

AFAIK most of the JSON usage in Swift are API interaction there is no objects marshalling via json in Swift.

Regarding the attack vector via memcache mentioned in comment #1, AFAIK every local user has access to memcached because there is not authC in place to stop her/him.

I am not that familiar with the openstack architecture, so...

- Where does the memcached run exactly?

- And does it only listen to 127.0.0.1?

memcached on Swift runs on every proxy servers and shared a cache so it bind on the internal network ip. For swift we always assume that the internal network needs to be secure since Swift has been designed this way.

It's not an immediate security risk, since the pickle data can't be modified by external users. But it could let someone e.g. escalate a network compromise into arbitrary code execution.

I've looked at switching some of the pickle serialization to json, but it's pretty fiddly and will take time to get right.

So we all agree that this is not directly exploitable in Swift current security model, but it would be a very welcome improvement to serialize to something less potentially harmful ?

If yes, I'd suggest we open this bug to the public as a welcome security strengthening issue (rather than keep it as an embargoed exploitable vulnerability).

Thomas/Sebastian: do you agree ?

I can agree with the reduced severity due to the attack vector and the additional steps needed.

I wish I could agree to the conclusion that this is not a vulnerability. It is a privilege escalation; an abuse is possible that crosses privilege boundaries to execute system commands.

The open question for me is only the level of impact. How likely is it to gain access to the internal network for an external attacker or an untrusted customer/user using a VM instance? What I heard from Sebastian is that it is really hard to separate the network if the attacker is an untrusted customer using a VM to execute network-level attacks.

Additionally Sebastian mentioned some ideas about alternative attack vectors in comment #2.

Sebastian, did you try to follow this ideas?

I also would not trust the authenticated user because OpenStack, by default, supports only password-based authentication and is at least vulnerable to brute force attacks.

So, for me it is a vulnerability with an yet unknown impact level.

The attack could be mitigated using authentication for memcached.

Are you speaking from nova to swift ? Usually the private networks

would be on different networks between nova and swift only the proxy

will be exposed to the VM and the memcached services will be only

listening to the private interface on the Swift side and due not

exposed to the VMs.

Ok, so theres no immediate impact, yet its probably still worth considering to replace pickle

by something that cannot execute commands in de-serialization.

Um, I just realized that we talked about 2 different attack vectors.

First, pickle is used in the backend to store and load data to/from extended attributes from

files inside read\_metadata(). Thats not nice, but not a severe issue if nobody can mod the xattrs.

Then, I just realized that pickle is also used in the memcache part. As memcached is distributed

over a lot of nodes and has no authentication, except your mentioned separation into

a private LAN, this is worse than the above case.

The swift proxy runs as root (is that necessary anyways, after binding to a low port?) and potentially

unpickles anything that he gets. If just someone polluted the memcached with evil pickle data.

I see your private LAN argument, but my experience in network consulting unfortunally shows me that

there is often no such strict separation so that memcached cannot be accessed from the VM/cloud network.

However, I am not exactly sure how to handle that without too much efforts.

E.g. an attacker from the VM or 'outside network' could send bogus ARP packets to the swift proxy,

polluting his ARP cache so that any connect() to an internal memcache IP will end at the attacker who can then

send any response to proxie's memcache.get() and trigger the pickle.

I think it will make a lot of headache to the network admin to nail down such things.

I am not really deep into the internals of WSGI, but would it be easily possible to drop

UID to a nova-user and/or chroot to /var/run/nova once swift proxy started? Or is that a problem

with python's importings?

E.g. an attacker from the VM or 'outside network' could send bogus ARP packets to the swift proxy,
polluting his ARP cache so that any connect() to an internal memcache IP will end at the attacker who can then
send any response to proxie's memcache.get() and trigger the pickle.

I've been looking at the use of pickle on the memcache side only, and it looks to me that moving to JSON there shouldn't be an issue -- I don't see any of the user calling it with really complex object types.

The only issue I can see with the default encoder/decoder is that some types will be changed after serialization/deserialization (for instance, tuples become lists, str becomes unicode, etc.). But I don't think it's something that will be a problem in the code.

As to the use of SASL for memcached: I'm not sure we want to implement that ourselves in our small memcache client : handling sasl, and moving to the binary protocal for memcache would have to be dealt with (not sure how easy it is to do sasl in python). We could instead use pylibmc (<http://sendapatch.se/projects/pylibmc/>) which wraps libmemcached and provides sasl support if the library was built with sasl.

What would be the preferred way here?

Here's a patch to use JSON instead of pickle for the memcache client. Moving to SASL will still be something worth the effort after that, but that's a first step, I guess.

This needs some more serious testing, as I'm unsure I correctly checked that all users of memcache are using simple-enough object types.

Also, as I wasn't sure that getting unicode when loading strings from json was good, I wrapped things to get str instead. I'm assuming we really always care only about utf8 (not sure this is a correct assumption, though).

Didn't get a clear answer to my proposal of opening this bug to public.

The fact that access to Swift "trusted" internal network allows you to fully compromise Swift is well-known. The "internal" network in Swift is much less vulnerable than the Nova internal network, where VM network containment vulnerabilities are much more likely (that's why Nova doesn't rely on a trusted network). And if you drop privileges to the swift user (as you should), there is no particular escalation due to use of pickle.

So we are left with the fact that breaking into Swift "trusted" internal network allows you to compromise Swift. I'd welcome any change that prevents that (or gives you at least the option to run on untrusted internal network), but we are a bit far away from that: all Swift internal RPC also rely on a trusted internal network model. So I see no reason to keep the discussion on that closed. On the contrary, discussing it in a small group probably slows us down in improving that well-known state.

So unless someone disagrees in the next 48 hours, I will open up this bug to the public.

I see your point. But would be very nice to use Vincent's json patch (pickle seems really overload

for simple string dictionary storage anyway). For me its OK to

make this bug public.

Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON

We don't want to use pickle as it can execute arbitrary code. JSON is

    safer. However, note that it supports serialization for only some

    specific subset of object types; this should be enough for what we need,

    though.

To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache

    poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a

    memcache\_serialization\_support configuration option, with the following

    values:

0 = older, insecure pickle serialization

     1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)

     2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)

To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should

    upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24

    hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in

    future versions.

Part of [bug 1006414](/bugs/1006414).

I don't have a permission to see the proposed essex backport but IMHO patch as-is is not appropriate for the stable branch.

It should at least be modified to have memcache\_serialization\_support=0 as default to avoid surprises on upgrade!

BTW does Swift team maintain stable branch at all? Currently stable/essex branch == 1.4.8 tag and last I remember was that stable for Swift is not needed, quoting PTL from one stable/essex proposal: "taking into account that swift releases are frequent, prod-ready, and there is a migration path for them" <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/6619/>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=854757#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-09-05 18:42:45 UTC  ```  Sebastian Krahmer (krahmer) reports:  swift uses pickle to store and load meta data. pickle is insecure and allows to execute arbitrary code in loads(). [...] BTW, you can read more on executing code via pickle or cPickle here: <http://nadiana.com/python-pickle-insecure>  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1006414](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/%2Bbug/1006414)  Additionally:  == Pickle is insecure in a model where an untrusted user can provide the pickled  data. In the Swift model the data is pickled by Swift itself and stored in  memcache, so the attack vector would suppose direct write access by an  untrusted user to memcached data ?  == memcached on Swift runs on every proxy servers and shared a cache so it bind  on the internal network ip. For swift we always assume that the internal  network needs to be secure since Swift has been designed this way.  == The commit message for the fix:  Reviewed: <https://review.openstack.org/9105> Committed: <http://github.com/openstack/swift/commit/e1ff51c04554d51616d2845f92ab726cb0e5831a> Submitter: Jenkins Branch: master  commit e1ff51c04554d51616d2845f92ab726cb0e5831a Author: Vincent Untz <vuntz> Date: Thu Jun 21 14:37:41 2012 +0200      Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON      We don't want to use pickle as it can execute arbitrary code. JSON is     safer. However, note that it supports serialization for only some     specific subset of object types; this should be enough for what we need,     though.      To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache     poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a     memcache_serialization_support configuration option, with the following     values:       0 = older, insecure pickle serialization      1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)      2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)      To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should     upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24     hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in     future versions.      Part of [bug 1006414](show_bug.cgi?id=1006414).
