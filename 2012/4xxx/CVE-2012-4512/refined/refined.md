{
  "CVE-2012-4512": {
    "Root cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw exists in the CSS parser of KDE libraries when parsing the location of a font face source. The parser does not properly validate the type of data it is processing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could craft a malicious web page that, when opened in an application using the vulnerable KDE libraries (like Konqueror), could cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted web page viewed in a vulnerable application."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to open a crafted web page using a vulnerable KDE application (such as a web browser). No special position or privileges are required."
  }
