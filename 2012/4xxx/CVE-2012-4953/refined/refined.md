Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of malformed CAB files by the CAB file decomposer component used in multiple Symantec Antivirus products. This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in the CAB file decompression component.
- Lack of proper input validation when parsing CAB files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- Successful exploitation occurs when a vulnerable Symantec product scans a specially crafted, malicious CAB file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted malformed CAB file.
- Attackers can deliver the malicious CAB file via various means, including network shares, web downloads, or email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote.
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious CAB file that will be scanned by a vulnerable Symantec product.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Symantec products, including Symantec Endpoint Protection 11, 12.0, AntiVirus Corporate Edition 10.x, and Symantec Scan Engine 5.2, 5.2.7 and prior.
- The decomposer components dec_abi.dll (used in Symantec Endpoint Protection 11) and Dec2CAB.dll (used in Symantec Scan Engine) are specifically mentioned as affected.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the antivirus software scans a malicious CAB file.

**Mitigation:**
- Apply the Symantec provided patch or upgrade to the fixed version.
- Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows.
- Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)
