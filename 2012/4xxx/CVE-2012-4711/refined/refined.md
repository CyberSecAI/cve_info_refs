- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The KingMess application in WellinTech KingView has a memory corruption vulnerability due to incorrect handling of exception information. Specifically, a specially crafted packet sent to the application can cause a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow (CWE-119) due to improper handling of exception information when processing specially crafted packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the KingMess application, leading to loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the system and potentially impact other systems in the environment.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted packet to the KingView application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a high skill level to craft the malicious packet and exploit the buffer overflow. They can be positioned remotely, as the vulnerability is network-accessible. Publicly available exploits and Metasploit module lowers the skill and time barrier of attack.
