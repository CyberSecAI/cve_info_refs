- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several parameters of HTTP requests, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to hijacking of user sessions (including customers, moderators, or admins), account theft, phishing attacks, and client-side content manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through vulnerable parameters in HTTP GET requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a victim user to click on a crafted link containing malicious script, requiring "high user interaction". The user would need to have a valid session on the vulnerable application.
- **Vulnerable parameters/modules**:
    - `createAnomaly.do` (parameters: `subTab`, `tab`)
    - `mindex.do` (parameters: `url`, `subTab`, `tab`)
    - `index2.do` (parameters: `url`, `tab`)
    - `syslogViewer.do` (parameter: `port`)
