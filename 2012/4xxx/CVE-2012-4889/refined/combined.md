Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected on the ME Firewall Analyzer v7.2 Application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing
& client-side content request manipulation.
