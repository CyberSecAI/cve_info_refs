  "CVE-2012-4481": {
    "description": "The safe-level feature in Ruby 1.8.6 through 1.8.6-420, 1.8.7 through 1.8.7-330, and 1.8.8dev allows context-dependent attackers to modify strings via the Exception#to_s method, as demonstrated by changing an intended pathname.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1005; the original patch for CVE-2011-1005 was incomplete when the NameError#to_s() method was used with Ruby objects.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect sanitization of file names.",
        "Incomplete fix for previous vulnerability",
        "Improper restriction of modifications to strings within protective safe levels."
      ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass safe level 4 restrictions, allowing untrusted (tainted) code to modify arbitrary, trusted (untainted) strings, potentially leading to unexpected behavior such as modifying file path names. Additionally it could expose sensitive information via exception messages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote access via a ruby application"
       ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make the vulnerable application create files or handle exceptions, with crafted input to trigger the vulnerability."
