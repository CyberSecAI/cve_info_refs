```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation in OpenJDK 7 failed to properly initialize integer arrays, resulting in non-zero elements immediately after allocation in specific scenarios.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Information disclosure: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially obtain sensitive data from uninitialized memory.
- Incorrect variable initialization: The Java Language Specification (JLS) stipulates that all variables should be initialized to 0/null, which is not upheld in the case of integer arrays.

Impact of exploitation:
- Information disclosure: Sensitive information residing in the JVM heap memory could be exposed.
- Functionality problems: Code relying on variables being initialized to zero might malfunction due to the vulnerability.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered during the allocation and initialization of integer arrays within the JVM.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker would need to be able to execute code that allocates and initializes integer arrays using the vulnerable version of OpenJDK 7.
