| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=856588#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-12 11:17:02 UTC  ``` An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implemenation of Java SE 7 as provided by OpenJDK 7, used to initialize integer arrays (they have had nonzero elements right after the allocation in certain circumstances). An attacker could use this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information. This flaw may also lead to various functionality problems that do not have security impacts.  References (including the reproducer): [1] <http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7196857> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/09/12/4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=856588#c1)  Ray Greenwell    2012-09-19 23:19:31 UTC  ``` This is a serious bug, not just an "information disclosure flaw".  The JLS says that all variables are initialized to 0/null, and code often relies on this fact.  I arrived here, finding this bug report, after tracking down an extremely serious issue with live production code. This isn't just "information disclosure", it's a problem with math not working in running code.  Thank goodness for the "-XX:-OptimizeFill" argument.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=856588#c2)  David Jorm    2012-09-20 01:36:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=856588#c1)) > This is a serious bug, not just an "information disclosure flaw".  This is a CVE tracking bug, intended primarily to capture the security impact of this flaw.

Subject: Re: CVE Request (minor) -- JVM: heap memory

Hello Steve,

  thank you for the clarification.

> not just Oracle's;

That's true, my yesterday's request was too wide, because in that moment we were
not sure yet, which concrete JVM implementations would be affected by this
deficiency (and which not).

> if so, then a separate CVE would be needed for each
> REPORTED codebase, and CVE-2012-4416 is ONLY for bug id 7196857 for the
> Oracle-supported JVM.

Anyway, upon David's review (Cc-ed too) we can announce that this problem would
affect / is specific only to Oracle Java SE 7 (java-1.7.0-oracle), and
Java SE 7 as provided by OpenJDK 7 (java-1.7.0-openjdk).

So after above suggestion we will use CVE-2012-4416 for Oracle's codebase /
Oracle supported JVM and the OpenJDK one should obtain another CVE identifier.

I will clarify this situation in our bugs too yet.

Kurt, could you allocate another CVE id then for the OpenJDK part of the
story?

Florian clarified on this already (why to assign CVE id for these is appropriate
approach).

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
