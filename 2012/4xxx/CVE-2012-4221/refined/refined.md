The provided content is related to CVE-2012-4221.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the `diagchar_ioctl` call of the Diagnostics (DIAG) kernel mode driver for Android. This can be triggered by a locally installed application passing a specially crafted input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Integer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit can lead to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected device. It can also result in a Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
A locally installed application can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to convince a user to install a specially crafted Android application on the device. The application needs to be able to send a crafted input to the `diagchar_ioctl` call of the DIAG kernel mode driver.

**Additional notes:**
The vulnerability is present in Android OS kernels running on certain Qualcomm devices using Linux kernel from the following heads: msm-3.4, msm-3.0, jb_*, ics_*, gingerbread_*. Permission changes in ICS and Jelly Bean that restrict /dev/diag access to qcom_diag group mitigate CVE-2012-4220 and CVE-2012-4221.
