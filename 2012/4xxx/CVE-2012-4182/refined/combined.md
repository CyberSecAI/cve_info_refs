How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863625#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-06 05:27:14 UTC  ``` Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed before general release.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-85.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Abhishek Arya as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863625#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:33:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1351 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1351.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863625#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:54:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1350.html>   ``` |  |

Reproduces reliably, just run the testcase with a couple of firefox instances at once.

Low volume, but it occurs also during normal use it seems:

Attached patch

[Patch](attachment.cgi?id=661578&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=661578&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=788950&attachment=661578)

This seems to fix it, in the vein of [bug 568362](/show_bug.cgi?id=568362 "RESOLVED FIXED - Protect IsPreFormatted callers from premature death"). But as [bug 568362 comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=568362#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Protect IsPreFormatted callers from premature death") points out, it's extremely fragile. Is there a better way to do this? Are there more methods we need to add this kind of guard to? Surely there are. How do we find them?
I don't have an exact breakdown, but I'm guessing what happens is that the nsHTMLEditRules method overwrites a bunch of document contents in the course of doing the insertHTML, which sets mRules to a new value, so "this" is no longer valid. I can't see from the source code where exactly this happens, though.

Yeah, this kind of thing is fragile indeed, but unfortunately we don't have a good way of fixing these issues in a better way in face of mutation events. :(

For anyone following Firefox patches this one screams "find use after free near here!" We really shouldn't be landing these kinds of obvious tiny patches until we're ready to usher them into all branches and particularly the current beta.Keywords: [csec-uaf](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csec-uaf&resolution=---)

Patch
Approving for all branches now as its low risk, sec-critical and baked on m-c for a while.
Thankfully we have the sec-approval flag now which will help prevent taking bugs on branches based upon a m-c landing .

Patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily can the security issue be deduced from the patch? Fairly easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? The patch itself is pretty obvious.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? Unknown.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? Should apply everywhere almost verbatim.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? Regressions are not very likely.

		 CVE-2012-4188

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
version of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-3982
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
	Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
	A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
	implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
	code via unspecified vectors, related to the
	nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
	Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
	GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
	the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
	impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
	attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
	service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
	vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
	memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
	allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze14.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

Reproduces on trunk. Don't have reliable testcase, but this is hitting every now and then. I got it once under a fully symbolized build that might give an idea of the problem. As i get the reliable testcase, i will attach it soon. This hits in both DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures and DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredExtensions.

It looks like sSVGStringListTearoffTable.GetTearoff is returning a dead pointer, which we then attempt to AddRef. It looks like the tearoff table intentionally doesn't hold a strong reference, so something is forgetting to remove itself when it dies I guess.

DOMSVGStringList::GetDOMWrapper creates a new DOMSVGStringList if necessary and adds it to the tear off table. DOMSVGStringList::~DOMSVGStringList removes the tear off from the list. It's the same as various other lists e.g. DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList.

The only difference for SVGTests is that they are properties on an element. If the element dies, ReleaseStringListPropertyValue would be called on the SVGStringList in DOMSVGTests.
The same kind of thing should happen on a DOMAnimatedLengthList though I think as the SVGAnimatedLength lists are members of the elements so if the element dies, so do they.

Are we then missing a virtual dtor or something?

neither DOMSVGStringList nor SVGStringList has one. We do set the pointer to the right type before we delete in ReleaseStringListPropertyValue though.
Another option might be to back out 754592 and see whether that stops it crashing. I could maybe create a try server build with that removed tomorrow.

So, i had a reliable testcase hit last night. Reliable in the sense that if i run like 15 firefox instances, it crashes 100% of the times with the ASAN stack. I won't be able to attach it since it is a fuzzer testcase and i am trying my minimizer on it. Minimization is just making unreliable since this looks timing dependent. I will try a few tricks over the next couple of days to see if i can get a good minimized testcase out of it.
For the time being, i tried your backout patch on my trunk where it reliably reproduced. And it completely stops the crash. Tested without(2)/with(2)/without(2) patch, just to make sure i was getting right results.

Attached patch

[backout patch for beta](attachment.cgi?id=657900&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=657900&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=786895&attachment=657900)

longsonr and I agree that the best bet for Aurora/Beta here is to back out [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data") on those branches.
The already-attached backout patch applies cleanly on Aurora; this patch applies cleanly on Beta. (This one is basically a clean backout, since not too much has changed between [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data")'s landing and current beta. There were I think 2 function-signature-changes in the code that [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data") added, which required trivial manual-merging to work around in the backout.)
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data")
User impact if declined: security risk
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): none (this is just a straight backout). No feature-loss, either -- [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data") was just an optimization.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low -- just a backout.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none

FWIW, I just landed the backout patch on trunk (using longsonr's "backout patch for aurora"). Noted in [bug 754592 comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592#c7 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data"), & reopened that bug (since that's the bug being backed out).

backout patch for aurora
[Triage Comment]
Backout to known good state for a security issue. It would be good to get a security rating on this bug for future reference.

OK, backouts have landed on trunk / Aurora / Beta (Firefox 18 / 17 / 16) -- cset links posted over on the bug being backed out, [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data").
Setting the status flags for those branches to "fixed". Setting status flag for 15 (current release) to "affected", since [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data") landed for Firefox 15.
(I've heard talk of there being a 15.0.1 (?) -- if we wanted to include this backout in that release, I'd be happy to land the backout on that branch, too.)

We'll let this ride for FF16, released in 4 weeks or so. We'd like to minimize change to critical regression/security bugs. It's not clear this qualifies based upon the difficulty to exploit.

The backout has fixed this bug. Obviously we still need to get the testcase here not to crash if we're to reenable the memory optimisation in [bug 754592](/show_bug.cgi?id=754592 "REOPENED - Lazily allocate conditional processing data") but that can be handled in that bug.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 12 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-85

## Use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of bounds read issues found using Address Sanitizer

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* Firefox ESR 10.0.8
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.8

### Description

Security researcher **Abhishek Arya** (Inferno) of the Google
Chrome Security Team discovered a series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and
out of bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software.
These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed before general release.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

		 CVE-2012-4188

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, Debian's
version of the Mozilla Firefox web browser.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-3982
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
	A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
	implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
	code via unspecified vectors, related to the
	nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
	GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
	the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
	impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
	attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
	service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
	vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
	memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
	allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.16-19.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.8esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

## Synopsis

Critical: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1351)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3982,
CVE-2012-3988, CVE-2012-3990, CVE-2012-3995, CVE-2012-4179, CVE-2012-4180,
CVE-2012-4181, CVE-2012-4182, CVE-2012-4183, CVE-2012-4185, CVE-2012-4186,
CVE-2012-4187, CVE-2012-4188)

Two flaws in Thunderbird could allow malicious content to bypass intended
restrictions, possibly leading to information disclosure, or Thunderbird
executing arbitrary code. Note that the information disclosure issue could
possibly be combined with other flaws to achieve arbitrary code execution.
(CVE-2012-3986, CVE-2012-3991)

Multiple flaws were found in the location object implementation in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site
scripting attacks, script injection, or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2012-1956,
CVE-2012-3992, CVE-2012-3994)

Two flaws were found in the way Chrome Object Wrappers were implemented.
Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks or
cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-3993, CVE-2012-4184)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Soroush Dalili,
miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen, Johnny Stenback, Alice White,
moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these
issues.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a

Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3982 CVE-2012-3986 CVE-2012-3990 CVE-2012-3991
                 CVE-2012-4179 CVE-2012-4180 CVE-2012-4182 CVE-2012-4186
                 CVE-2012-4188

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceape, an internet
suite based on Seamonkey:

CVE-2012-3982
        Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
        allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
        corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
        arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
        Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
        A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
        implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
        code via unspecified vectors, related to the
        nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
        Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
        GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
        the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
        impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
        attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
        service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
        remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
        vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
        memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
        allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
        unspecified vectors.

Additionally, this update fixes a regression in the patch for
CVE-2012-3959, released in DSA-2554-1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-16.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
