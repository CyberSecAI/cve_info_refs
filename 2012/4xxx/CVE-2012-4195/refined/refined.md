  "CVE-2012-4195": {
    "description": "Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that the CheckURL function in window.location can be forced to return the wrong calling document and principal, allowing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. There is also the possibility of gaining arbitrary code execution if the attacker can take advantage of an add-on that interacts with the page content.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `CheckURL` function in `window.location` can be forced to return the wrong calling document and principal.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect principal verification in nsLocation::CheckURL"
      ],
      "impact": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack and potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker can leverage an add-on that interacts with page content.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious web content exploiting the vulnerable function."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content into a page or be able to convince a user to visit a malicious site. Additionally, for arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs an add-on that allows for chrome code interaction."
