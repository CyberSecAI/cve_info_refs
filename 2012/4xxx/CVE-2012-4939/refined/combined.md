| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Hotfix**The vendor has stated this vulnerability has been addressed in IPAM-v3.0-HotFix1. Users are advised to apply the hotfix. The vendor has stated this hotfix will be incorporated in the next version of IPAM v3.1, due this quarter and that customers under maintenance can get access to this hot fix via their SolarWinds Customer Portal. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the SolarWinds Orion IPAM web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
