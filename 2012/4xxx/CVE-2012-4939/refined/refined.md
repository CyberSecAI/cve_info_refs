- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SolarWinds Orion IPAM web interface fails to properly sanitize user input in the "Search for an IP address" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). Input is not neutralized during web page generation, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the SolarWinds Orion IPAM web interface can conduct a reflected cross-site scripting attack. This can lead to information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. Specifically, the attacker injects a malicious script into the "Search for an IP address" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the SolarWinds Orion IPAM web interface.
