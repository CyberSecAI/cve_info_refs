# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

# USN-1629-1: libproxy vulnerabilities

12 November 2012

libproxy could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially
crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libproxy](/security/cves?package=libproxy) - automatic proxy configuration management library

## Details

Tomas Mraz discovered that libproxy incorrectly handled certain PAC files.

A remote attacker could use this issue to cause libproxy to crash, or to

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-4504](/security/CVE-2012-4504), [CVE-2012-4505](/security/CVE-2012-4505))

Subject: libproxy PAC downloading buffer overflows

Hi!

libproxy 0.4.9 fixes a buffer overflow reported by Tomas Mraz:

<http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/source/detail?r=853>
<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/libproxy/VxZ8No7mT0E>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4504>

Upstream announcement also mentions another issue - CVE-2012-4505.  It
is related, but different problem that was found in pre-0.4 versions
while investigating if they were affected by CVE-2012-4504.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4505>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=864417#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 11:53:33 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the libproxy's url::get_pac() used to download proxy.pac proxy auto-configuration file.  A malicious host hosting proxy.pac, or a man in the middle attacker, could use this flaw to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in an application using libproxy, if proxy configuration instructed it to download proxy.pac file from a remote HTTP server.  url::get_pac() uses a fixed size buffer buffer[] to store content of the proxy.pac file downloaded from a remote server.  When filling the buffer, it uses server-supplied content length value, rather than size buffer, as a limit for the size of the input copied into the buffer.  Overflow occurs when server provides sufficiently large file and does not use chunked content encoding.  The buffer size is checked when using chunked encoding.  <http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/source/browse/trunk/libproxy/url.cpp?r=846#462>  This issue was introduced upstream with the addition of the chunked encoding support, which first appears in version 0.4.  <http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/source/detail?r=489> <http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/issues/detail?id=77>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=864417#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 11:55:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 624045](attachment.cgi?id=624045&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=624045&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  Patch from Nicolas Dufresne, moving the content length value check to appear on a non-chunked encoding code path.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=864417#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 12:00:35 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=864612#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 18:21:42 UTC  ``` An insufficient input validation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in libproxy 0.3.x in the px_pac_reload() function.  libproxy allocates a memory to store downloaded proxy.pac proxy auto-configuration file content using the Content-Length size from the remote server's HTTP response header.  Allocation size is content length + 1.  A malicious host hosting proxy.pac, or a man in the middle attacker, could use this flaw to make libproxy allocate insufficient amount of memory and subsequently overflow a heap-based buffer.  <http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/source/browse/tags/libproxy-0.3.1/src/lib/pac.c#165>  165      self->cache = px_malloc0(content_length+1); 166      for (int recvd=0 ; recvd != content_length ; ) 167              recvd += recv(sock, self->cache + recvd, content_length - recvd, 0);  This issue was confirmed with libproxy 0.3.x.  Earlier 0.2.x versions seems to be affected too.  It does not affect 0.4.x versions, where fixed size buffer is used.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=864612#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 18:24:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=864612#c0)) > It does not affect 0.4.x versions, where fixed size buffer is used.  0.4.x versions were affected by a different overflow in the PAC loading code, see [bug 864417](show_bug.cgi?id=864417 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2012-4504 libproxy: long proxy.pac file handling buffer overflow").  This problem was discovered while investigating the 0.4.x issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=864612#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 18:51:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgment:  This issue was discovered by the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=864612#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-12 07:59:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 625842](attachment.cgi?id=625842&action=diff "libproxy 0.3 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=625842&action=edit "libproxy 0.3 patch") libproxy 0.3 patch  Proposed patch for libproxy 0.3.x.

picking 0.4.10, which fixes an infinite loop in the PAC downloading
code (incorrectly fixed in 0.4.9, reportedly also breaking chunked
encoding downloads).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=864417#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 11:53:33 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the libproxy's url::get_pac() used to download proxy.pac proxy auto-configuration file.  A malicious host hosting proxy.pac, or a man in the middle attacker, could use this flaw to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in an application using libproxy, if proxy configuration instructed it to download proxy.pac file from a remote HTTP server.  url::get_pac() uses a fixed size buffer buffer[] to store content of the proxy.pac file downloaded from a remote server.  When filling the buffer, it uses server-supplied content length value, rather than size buffer, as a limit for the size of the input copied into the buffer.  Overflow occurs when server provides sufficiently large file and does not use chunked content encoding.  The buffer size is checked when using chunked encoding.  <http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/source/browse/trunk/libproxy/url.cpp?r=846#462>  This issue was introduced upstream with the addition of the chunked encoding support, which first appears in version 0.4.  <http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/source/detail?r=489> <http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/issues/detail?id=77>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=864417#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 11:55:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 624045](attachment.cgi?id=624045&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=624045&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  Patch from Nicolas Dufresne, moving the content length value check to appear on a non-chunked encoding code path.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=864417#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-09 12:00:35 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.

Please REJECT CVE-2012-4521, sorry I literally just woke up and can't
read so good it seems. Mea culpa.
