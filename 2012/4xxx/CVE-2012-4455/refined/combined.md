| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-15 07:41:40 UTC  ``` opencryptoki, when compiled with -DSPINXPL (as it is in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora), creates certain dot files in the /tmp directory, such as .pkapi_xpk and .pkcs11spinloc.  These are not temporary files and are rather used for locking purposes.  They are created in a way that allows symlink attacks.  As files are opened RDWR, and not written to, they don't seem to allow file corruption as typical symlink attacks do.  It is still possible to create new files at arbitrary locations (e.g. /etc/nologin) or make arbitrary file world writable (e.g. /etc/shadow) with the privileges of the user running pkcsslotd or an application using opencrpytoki library.  Attacker does not need to be a member of the pkcs11 group, though symlinks would usually need to be created before the first use of the opencryptoki on the system.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-07 16:52:32 UTC  ``` This was recently fixed upstream via following commit, which moves lock files to /var/lock (.pkapi_xpk -> /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki, .pkcs11spinloc -> /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki_stdll):  <http://sourceforge.net/p/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/ci/58345488c9351d9be9a4be27c8b407c2706a33a9>  Note that the above patch was applied after upstream removed all other locking schemes except of spinlocks:  <http://sourceforge.net/p/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/ci/b7fcb3eb0319183348f1f4fb90ede4edd6487c30>  The fix is included in version 2.4.1 (currently in Fedora 17 and later).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-07 12:55:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c2)) > This was recently fixed upstream via following commit, which moves lock > files to /var/lock (.pkapi_xpk -> /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki, > .pkcs11spinloc -> /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki_stdll): >  > <http://sourceforge.net/p/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/ci/5834548>  There are additional changes in 2.4.2, moving lock files to pkcs11 group writable /var/lock/opencryptoki directory.  This seems to re-introduce problems described in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c0), but only allowing pkcs11 group members to exploit them.  In the current openCryptoki implementation, users of the pkcs11 group need to be fully trusted (see [bug #730635](show_bug.cgi?id=730635 "CLOSED CANTFIX - opencryptoki: privilege escalation via pkcsslotd's shared memory modification")).  This is now public via: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/8334>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-27 13:04:43 UTC  ``` [CVE-2012-4454](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4454) was assigned to the insecure handling of files in the /tmp directory that affected openCryptoki versions 2.4.0 and earlier, as described in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c0):  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/8334/focus=8509](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/8334/focus%3D8509)  Additional [CVE-2012-4455](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4455) was assigned for the fix in 2.4.1 (the move of files to /var/lock), which does not address the original issue on systems with world-writable /var/lock directory.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux was never affected by this problem, as it does not yet contain a change moving lock files from /tmp.  openCryptoki version is currently available in Fedora 17.  However, Fedora (and Red Hat Enterprise Linux) do not have world-writable /var/lock and are hence unaffected by this CVE.  Statement CVE-2012-4455:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the openCryptoki packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2014-07-23 10:49:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c6)) > There are additional changes in 2.4.2, moving lock files to pkcs11 group > writable /var/lock/opencryptoki directory.  Relevant upstream commit from 2.4.2 is: <http://sourceforge.net/p/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/ci/8a63b3b17d34718d0f8c7525f93b5eb3c623076a>  Quick overview of lock file changes across opencryptoki versions:  * /tmp/.pkapi_xpk (version 2.4 and earlier)   -> /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki (version 2.4.1)   -> /var/lock/opencryptoki/LCK..APIlock (version 2.4.2)  * /tmp/.pkcs11spinloc (version 2.4 and earlier)   -> /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki_stdll (version 2.4.1)   -> /var/lock/opencryptoki/<token>/LCK..<token> (version 2.4.2, there is a      per-token sub-directory in /var/lock/opencryptoki, with possible      additional per-user sub-directory for tpm token)  > This seems to re-introduce problems described in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c0), but only > allowing pkcs11 group members to exploit them.  These changes in 2.4.2 indeed re-introduce the problems described in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c0), but they can only be exploited by users in a fully-trusted pkcs11 group (which should be considered root-equivalent).  However, as all directories as pkcs11 group writable, there's no longer a requirement that malicious symlink needs to be created before those lock files are first created.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=730636#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2014-07-23 19:34:34 UTC  ``` This issue was mitigated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHBA-2013:1592, released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1592.html>  The erratum update opencryptoki packages to upstream version 2.4.3.1, which stores lock files in /var/lock/opencryptoki directory instead of /tmp.  As the directory is only accessible to users in the pkcs11 group, only members of that group can exploit this insecure temporary file handling issues.  However, as the group is privileged and should only contain fully trusted users, the change greatly reduces impact of the issue.  This behavior may be restricted further in future updates if the behavior is changed upstream.  There is currently not plan to address these issues in opencryptoki packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ``` |  |

When do pkcsslotd does that, and which version?  It does not happen on
its start or stop, or when client as pkcsconf queries for some data.

Right, agree that 2.4.1 does not make any relevant change
where /var/lock has such permissions.

If pkcs11 group member can make pkcsslotd chmod lock file, pkcs11 group
membership need to be assumed root equivalent without any additional
condition.

Apologies for the late reply.

I'm going to assign 2 CVE's:

Please use CVE-2012-4454 for opencryptoki insecure lock files handling
in /tmp in 2.4.0

Please use CVE-2012-4455 for opencryptoki insecure lock files handling
in /var/tmp in 2.4.1

Subject: CVE request: opencryptoki insecure lock files handling

Hi,

Niels Heinen (Google) discovered that openCryptoki 2.4.0 and older, when
spinlocks are used, incorrectly handle lock files stored in /tmp. It is
possible for an attacker to replace the lock files with symlinks and have
pkcsslotd (or others) fchmod the target of the symlink to make it world-
writable, create arbitrary files, etc.
In response, upstream released 2.4.1[1] which fixed the fchmod issue (commits
[3] and [4]).
Niels discovered that 2.4.1 still allowed arbitrary files creation by
following symlinks. Upstream then released 2.4.2[2], fixing this last issue
(commits [5] and [6]).

Even with the fixes in 2.4.2, members of the pkcs11 group could still use
symlink attacks. However, as per upstream's documentation, members of such
group are expected to be trusted[7].

Could CVE ids be assigned?

I think two ids is more appropriate given that the issue isn't fixed in 2.4.1
for systems with world writable /var/lock. 2.4.2, on the other hand, covers
boths scenarios (given that pkcs11 group membership is already considered
root-equivalent.)

Ok, so I think we need 1 CVE for the two insecure temporary file uses,
unless we want to split each temporary file issue under a separate
CVE.  I don't believe there's a real need to assign CVE for 2.4.1
(which did not improve things on systems with world writable /var/lock)
or 2.4.2 (which re-opens the attack for pkcs11 group members on systems
with restricted /var/lock, but improves things on systems with world
writable /var/lock).

AFAIK, this was reported to upstream more than once before it got
fixed.

There were following problems that I'm aware of:

- /tmp/.pkapi_xpk - This was normally created by pcksslotd (running as
  root).  Symlink attack on this did not allow corrupting / truncating
  files, but allowed creating new empty files at arbitrary locations.

- /tmp/.pkcs11spinloc - I believe this is created by opencryptoki
  clients.  In addition to the above, there's a chmod to make this file
  world writable.  This may get created by non-root user, but chmod
  may still run later with root privileges later.

Those files do not seem to get removed as part of the normal operation,
so replacing them with symlinks if they already exist is limited
by /tmp stickiness.  Attacker does not need to be pkcs11 group member.

2.4.1 moved those files that became /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki
and /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki_stdll respectively.

> Niels discovered that 2.4.1 still allowed arbitrary files creation by
> following symlinks.

Would you mind clarifying?  As files were moved to /var/lock, this
should require attacker to have permissions to write to that directory.

> Upstream then released 2.4.2[2], fixing this last issue (commits [5]
> and [6]).

What do 2.4.2 actually fix?  I think the move of /tmp/.pkcs11spinloc
to /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki_stdll probably created a regression in
use cases where opencryptoki clients run without root privileges (or
better to say without privileges to create the file in /var/lock/).

Another move to pkcs11 group writable /var/lock/opencryptoki seems to
resolve that, but it also negates benefits of the 2.4.1 security fix.
Based on the rather quick look at the patches you pointed out, 2.4.2
seems to have the same problems pre-2.4.1 had, with following changed
conditions:
- attacker now needs to be pkcs11 group member
- lack of directory stickiness should make it easier to execute the
  attack

Correct, any pkcs11 group member can easily compromise any other user
using opencryptoki library see:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=730635>

Upstream does not see that as an issue though...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
