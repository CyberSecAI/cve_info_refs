Consult the dedicated section for Cisco PIX   Security Appliances in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this   security advisory for more information about affected versions.   Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory.      **DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability**      This vulnerability is triggered when the Cisco ASA Software processes a DHCP request. DHCP relay and DHCP server features will trigger the DHCP request packet process. If either feature is enabled, the Cisco ASA Software may be vulnerable.    To determine whether the DHCP server feature is enabled on Cisco ASA Software use the   **show dhcpd state** command and verify that at least one interface is configured   for DHCP server. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with DHCP   server enabled on the *inside* interface  ```   ciscoasa# show dhcpd state   Context  Configured as DHCP Server   Interface inside, Configured for DHCP SERVER      ```  To determine whether the DHCP relay feature is enabled on Cisco ASA Software use the   **show dhcprelay state** command and verify that DHCP relay is active. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with DHCP relay enabled.  ```   ciscoasa# show dhcprelay stateContext  Configured as DHCP RelayInterface outside, Configured for DHCP RELAY SERVERInterface inside, Configured for DHCP RELAY   ```  **Note:** By default, DHCP server is enabled on the inside interface of the Cisco ASA 5505 and on the management interface of all other Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. DHCP server is disabled by default on Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module.  DHCP relay feature is not enabled by default on any Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco   Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module platforms.          **SSL VPN Authentication Denial of Service Vulnerability** This vulnerability may affect Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN. Cisco ASA Software configured as an IPsec VPN Server, IPsec/L2TP VPN Server or IKEv2 AnyConnect VPN server is not affected. Because this vulnerability is triggered when receiving a crafted authentication challenge-response, Cisco ASA Software is not affected when configured to use the AAA protocol that does not support the challenge option or with the challenge option disabled.  To be affected, the Cisco ASA Software should have SSL VPN enabled and the   tunnel group configured to authenticate to a remote AAA server using a   AAA protocol that has the AAA challenge option enabled.       Currently the following AAA setup may be configured with the challenge option enabled and hence be considered vulnerable:    1. Native RSA SecurID (also known as SDI) - This is vulnerable when the SecureID server requires a challenge response from the user.   2. RADIUS and TACACS+ authentication challenge - These are vulnerable when the AAA server uses a token-based authentication system which is capable of sending challenge requests to authenticating users.   3. Active Directory password management via RADIUS or LDAP. In these cases the Cisco ASA Software facilitates a user password change prior to authentication with Active Directory.Other AAA authentication methods supported by the Cisco ASA Software such as HTTP form-based or using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and Kerberos authentication protocols   are not affected by this vulnerability.    To determine whether Cisco ASA Software has SSL VPN enabled use the **show   running-config webvpn** command and verify that SSL VPN is enabled on at least one   interface. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SSL VPN enabled   on the *outside* interface:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn   webvpn    enable outside      ```  To determine whether the Cisco ASA Software has the tunnel group configured for   a remote AAA server, use the **show running-config tunnel-group    general-attributes** command and verify that the   *authentication-server-group* is set to authenticate to a remote AAA   server. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with the tunnel group   *WebVPN* configured to authenticate against a remote AAA server with tag labeled *RSA*.  ```   ciscoasa#show running-config tunnel-group WebVPN general-attributes   tunnel-group WebVPN general-attributes    authentication-server-group RSA   ```  To determine which AAA protocol is in use for a given AAA server, use the **show aaa-server** . The AAA protocol in use is indicated under *Server Group*. The following example shows a AAA server with tag labeled *RSA* which is using RSA SecurID (SDI) as AAA protocol:  ```   ciscoasa# show aaa-server RSAServer Group:    RSAServer Protocol: sdi   ```  **Note:** SSL VPN is not enabled by default. The default AAA setting for tunnel   group is LOCAL which is not affected by this vulnerability.       **SIP Inspection Media Update Denial of Service Vulnerability**      The Cisco ASA Software may be affected by this vulnerability if Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) inspection is enabled.      To determine whether SIP inspection is enabled use the   **show service-policy inspect sip** command. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software   with SIP inspection enabled:     ```    ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sip      Inspect: sip , packet 67, drop 0, reset-drop 0    ```  **Note:** SIP inspection functionality is enabled by default.    **DCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability and DCERPC Inspection Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by these vulnerabilities if DCERPC inspection is enabled.      To determine whether the DCERPC inspection is enabled use the   **show service-policy | include dcerpc** command. The following example shows the Cisco ASA   Software with DCERPC inspection enabled:     ```    ciscoasa# show  service-policy | include dcerpc      Inspect: dcerpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0    ```  **Note:** DCERPC inspection is not enabled by default.    Determine the Running Software Version To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version**   command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive   Security Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):      ```    ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) Device Manager Version 6.4(1)    ```    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to   manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is   displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM   window. Information about Cisco PIX Security Appliance SoftwareAll versions of the Cisco PIX Security Appliance Software are affected by the DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability.      Cisco PIX Security Appliance Software is not affected by any other vulnerabilities described in this security advisory.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall and Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security are not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      With the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The following section provides additional information about each vulnerability.   **DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability**    DHCP is a   protocol that supplies automatic configuration parameters such as an IP   address with a subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server, and WINS server   IP address to hosts.  The   Cisco ASA Software can act as a DHCP server or a DHCP client. When it operates   as a server, the Cisco ASA Software provides network configuration parameters   directly to DHCP clients.  A   vulnerability exists in the implementation of the Dynamic Host   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server functionality that   would allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of   the affected device. This vulnerability is due to a failure in   allocating memory for an internal DHCP data structure upon receiving   crafted DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a sequence of crafted DHCP packets to the affected system  **Note:** This vulnerability may be triggered by both transit traffic and traffic directed to the affected device. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall modes in both single-context and multicontext modes. This vulnerability can be triggered only by   IPv4 traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtw84068](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtw84068) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4643   **SSL VPN Authentication Denial of Service Vulnerability**      The Cisco ASA Software includes two types of SSL VPN, which is a technology for remote access to corporate resources:   + Clientless SSL VPN provides access to Web applications, such as email, and     corporate portals via Web browsers and Java components. It requires no     client software.   + The AnyConnect SSL VPN Client.   A vulnerability exists in the implementation of the   authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) code for remote   the SSL VPN (Clientless and AnyConnect) feature that could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected   system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of a crafted   authentication response when a AAA challenge-response is required to complete the   authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   trying to authenticate on an ASA configured for SSL VPN with a   crafted authentication challenge response. This   vulnerability affects a Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN. Cisco ASA Software configured as an IPsec VPN Server, IPSEC/L2TP VPN Server or IKEv2 AnyConnect server is not affected. **Note:**   Only traffic destined to the affected device can be used to exploit   this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software configured in   routed and single context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 traffic only.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtz04566](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz04566) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4659      **SIP Inspection Media Update Denial of Service Vulnerability**    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as defined by the   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), enables call handling sessions,   particularly two-party audio conferences. SIP works with Session Description Protocol (SDP)   for call signaling. SDP specifies the ports for the media stream.   Cisco ASA Software supports dynamic allocation of ports for media stream via a dedicated SIP inspection engine.  A vulnerability exists in the SIP inspection engine code of the Cisco ASA Software, that   may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of   the affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper processing   of SIP media update packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP packet through the affected system. The   packets that trigger this vulnerability must be part of an established   SIP inspection session that needs to be inspected by the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This   vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both   single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtr63728](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr63728) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4660   **DCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**      DCERPC is a protocol that is widely used by Microsoft distributed client and server applications that allows software   clients to remotely execute programs on a server.      A vulnerability exists in the DCERPC inspection engine that would allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to overflow the stack and possibly execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DCERPC packets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a crafted DCERPC packet that needs to be inspected by the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit   this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and   transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This   vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtr21359](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr21359) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4661      **DCERPC Inspection Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities**      Two vulnerabilities exist in the DCERPC inspection engine that would allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of DCERPC packets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a crafted DCERPC packet that needs to be inspected by the affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit   these vulnerabilities. This vulnerabilities affects both routed and   transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs, [CSCtr21376](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr21376) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCtr21346](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr21346) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2012-4662 and CVE-2012-4663  Workarounds  * The following section contains information about a workaround, if available, for each vulnerability described in this security advisory.  **DHCP Memory Allocation Denial of Service Vulnerability**Besides disabling the DHCP server and DHCP relay features, there are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. **SSL VPN Authentication Denial of Service Vulnerability**There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. **SIP Inspection Media Update Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Disabling SIP inspection will mitigate this vulnerability.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.    This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20121010-fwsm>      **Note:** The Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module, and the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance may also be affected by these vulnerabilities.      The vulnerabilities affecting the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module and Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance have been disclosed in a separate Cisco Security Advisory. The Advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20121010-asa>  Affected Products  * The Cisco FWSM for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers is affected by multiple   vulnerabilities. The affected versions of the Cisco FWSM varies   depending on the specific vulnerability.   Vulnerable ProductsConsult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.      **DCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**      The Cisco FWSM is vulnerable when DCERPC   inspection is enabled. DCERPC inspection   is not enabled by default.      ****DCERPC Inspection Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities****The Cisco FWSM is vulnerable when DCERPC inspection is enabled. DCERPC inspection is not enabled by default.  **Checking Whether DCERPC Inspection Is Enabled**      To determine if your FWSM configuration is affected by these vulnerabilities, issue the   **show service-policy | include dcerpc** command.       The following example indicates a Cisco FWSM   with DCERPC inspection enabled:     ```   fwsm# show  service-policy | include dcerpc      Inspect: dcerpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0   ``` How to Determine the Running Software Version To determine the version of the Cisco FWSM software that is running on a device, administrators can issue the **show version** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   FWSM> show version      FWSM Firewall Version 4.0(16)   [...]   ```  Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)   to manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed   in the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the   Cisco ASDM window. The version notation is similar to the following   example:  ```   FWSM Version: 4.0(16)   ```  Version information can also be obtained from the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch or the Cisco 7600 Series Router. To determine the version of Cisco FWSM Software that is running on a device, issue the **show module**   command from Cisco IOS Software or Cisco Catalyst Operating System   Software to identify what modules and submodules are installed on the   system.  The following example shows a system with a Cisco FWSM (WS-SVC-FWM-1) installed in slot 2:  ```   switch>show module   Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.   --- ----- -------------------------------------- ------------------ -----------     1   16  SFM-capable 16 port 1000mb GBIC        WS-X6516-GBIC      SAL06334NS9     2    6  Firewall Module                        WS-SVC-FWM-1       SAD10360485     3    8  Intrusion Detection System             WS-SVC-IDSM-2      SAD0932089Z     4    4  SLB Application Processor Complex      WS-X6066-SLB-APC   SAD093004BD     5    2  Supervisor Engine 720 (Active)         WS-SUP720-3B       SAL0934888E      Mod MAC addresses                       Hw    Fw           Sw           Status   --- ---------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------     1  0009.11e3.ade8 to 0009.11e3.adf7   5.1   6.3(1)       8.7(0.22)BUB Ok     2  0018.ba41.5092 to 0018.ba41.5099   4.0   7.2(1)       4.0(16)      Ok     3  0014.a90c.9956 to 0014.a90c.995d   5.0   7.2(1)       7.0(4)E4     Ok     4  0014.a90c.66e6 to 0014.a90c.66ed   1.7   Unknown      Unknown      PwrDown     5  0013.c42e.7fe0 to 0013.c42e.7fe3   4.4   8.1(3)       12.2(33)SXH8 Ok      [...]   ```  After locating the correct slot, issue the **show module**  command to identify the software version that is running, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch>show module 2   Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.   --- ----- -------------------------------------- ------------------ -----------     2    6  Firewall Module                        WS-SVC-FWM-1       SAD10360485      Mod MAC addresses                       Hw    Fw           Sw           Status   --- ---------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------     2  0018.ba41.5092 to 0018.ba41.5099   4.0   7.2(1)       4.0(16)      Ok      [...]   ```  The preceding example shows that the Cisco FWSM is running software version 4.0(16) as indicated by the Sw column. If a Virtual Switching System (VSS) is used to allow two physical   Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches to operate as a single logical   virtual switch, the **show module switch all** command can   display the software version of all FWSMs that belong to switch 1 and   switch 2. The output from this command will be similar to the output   from **show module**  but will include module information for the modules in each switch in the VSS.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableWith the exception of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance, and Cisco ASA Service Module, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco FWSM is a high-speed, integrated   firewall module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600   Series Routers. The FWSM offers firewall services with stateful packet   filtering and deep packet inspection.  The Cisco FWSM is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, which are described in the following sections: **DCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability** DCERPC is a protocol widely used by Microsoft   distributed client and server applications that allows software clients   to execute programs on a server remotely. A   vulnerability exists in the code of the DCERPC inspection engine that   would allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the   affected system or to overflow the stack and possibly execute arbitrary   commands. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DCERPC   packets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by sending a crafted DCERPC packet that will be   inspected by the affected system.    **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit   this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and   transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This   vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtr27522](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr27522) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4661.      ****DCERPC Inspection Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities****      Two vulnerabilities exist in the DCERPC inspection engine that would   allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected   system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of DCERPC   packets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by   sending a crafted DCERPC packet that will be inspected by the   affected system.      **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit   these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities affect both routed and   transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. These   vulnerabilities can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtr27524](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr27524) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCtr27521](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr27521) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and have been assigned CVE IDs CVE-2012-4662 and CVE-2012-4663, respectively.  Workarounds  * Administrators can mitigate these vulnerabilities by disabling the DCERPC inspection if it is not required.      No other workarounds exist to mitigate these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.4 |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
