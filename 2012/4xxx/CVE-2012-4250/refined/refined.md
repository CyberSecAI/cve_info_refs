- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `RequestScreenOptimization` function of the `XProcessControl.ocx` ActiveX control within the Samsung NET-i Viewer application. This function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a large input string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and redirecting the program's flow of execution to attacker-controlled code (shellcode).
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted long string argument to the `RequestScreenOptimization` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a webpage with the malicious ActiveX control to a vulnerable user using Internet Explorer. The user must have the vulnerable version of Samsung NET-i Viewer installed.
