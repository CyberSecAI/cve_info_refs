  "cve": "CVE-2012-4930",
  "description": "The SPDY protocol 3 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and other products, can perform TLS encryption of compressed data without properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by observing length differences during a series of guesses in which a string in an HTTP request potentially matches an unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a \"CRIME\" attack.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Mozilla Firefox",
    "Google Chrome",
    "Other products using SPDY protocol 3 or earlier"
    ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The SPDY protocol's header compression, when used over TLS, doesn't properly obfuscate the length of the unencrypted data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information leakage via compression side-channel",
      "Lack of length obfuscation in compressed data"
    ],
      "impact": "Man-in-the-middle attackers can obtain plaintext HTTP headers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Network traffic analysis"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Ability to monitor network traffic",
      "Knowledge of the SPDY protocol and compression mechanisms"
    ]
  },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is known as CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) and specifically affects SPDY's header compression when used over TLS. The attacker sends a series of modified requests. By observing the change in the size of compressed messages, they can deduce the contents of the headers character by character. This is a chosen plaintext attack. Red Hat stated that the versions of Firefox shipped with RHEL 5 and 6 were not vulnerable as they did not support SPDY."
